            "description": "Tassie is a shy mama terrier mix who was rescued from a hoarding home with over 40 dogs. We believe she is roughly 2 1/2 years old. She spent her life in a backyard and was never socialized. She was abused by the husband and 2 sons in the home. After her puppies were placed in adoptive homes, Tassie has been learning how to be a house dog and learning about the perks of living in a human home full of affection.\n\nTassie has been thriving in her foster home and is learning to love toys, bully sticks and running around. She's definitely come into her own and is a playful little diva. She's currently being fostered with other dogs, peacocks, pigs and chickens! Boy has her life turned around!!\n\nTassie is fostered in Sonoma County, CA and will be available to adopt from Santa Rosa 95403 at a pre-approved, scheduled appoinment. Due to COVID-19 we are NOT doing any meet and greets at this time.\n\nIf you are interseted in adopting Tassie, please email an application to start that process to softpawsrescue@gmail.com. You can find our application at www.softpawsrescue.org/applytoadopt , please also attach pictures of the inside of your home (anyplace the dog would be) as well as your front and backyards.\n\nA note from Tassies foster mom: Tassie may take a little bit to warm up, but is super affectionate, cuddly and loyal once shes comfortable. She is happy cuddling on the couch in bed for the majority of the day. As shes come out of her shell, shes become more playful and is still in the process of figuring out doggy toys. She is so incredibly snuggly and would LOVE to sleep on the bed with her owners. Shes not technically house trained but if you stick to a regular walk/backyard schedule she doesnt have accidents in the house. Shes had positive encounters with calm, friendly, dogs and is becoming confident around them. She loves her bully sticks and will collect them and corral them around the house. She is still unsure about young children and men. Overall she is an incredible dog that has made leaps and bounds of progress since being with her foster family. Were confident that she will make a patient, loving family incredibly happy.",

As an older lady, she doesn't require tons of exercise, so if you think you might be too lazy for a dog, you should meet Tia! Tia is very intuitive, and can tell when her humans had a rough day and need extra snuggles - how cool is that?! She is house-trained, and will let you know when she needs to go outside by letting out a quick bark or by standing at the door. Otherwise, she really doesn't bark much. She's worked on her tricks and really wants to show off that she knows how to 'shake.' Plus, she does great when left home alone. Tia would do best as the only pup in the house - she can provide enough emotional support to her humans, and she wants to be the top dog! Tia loves her humans and has so much love to give to the right home. Her ideal home would be one with a yard where she can run around with her humans. Come meet your new snuggle buddy Tia! She would love to binge watch that new Netflix series with you.",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing THE FIRST STEP IN ADOPTING A SNARR DOG IS FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION AT WWW.SNARRNORTHEAST.ORG/APPLICATIONS.****\n\nName: Penny\n\nAge: 2 years\n\nCurrent Weight: 46 lbs\n\nRescued from: Tennessee\n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccinations, spayed, microchipped\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n\nPenny is a loving and lively 2 year old redbone coonhound mix with a beautiful deep red coat, soulful eyes and a joyful disposition. Those eyes make her look serious, but she is all about fun! This smart and social gal thrives on interaction and activity. She\u2019s a great sidekick who likes to go everywhere with her people (she settles right in in the car), and makes friends wherever she goes. \n\nPenny loves to play, and is looking for a home with a fenced yard and a canine buddy. (She is not a cat person). Her leash walking skills are excellent, she knows basic commands and she\u2019s very eager to please -particularly for treats! True to her coonhound heritage, she\u2019s inclined to be vocal when she\u2019s excited, but she is making good progress learning to redirect her attention. Pretty Penny is ready to find an active forever home where she can truly shine. \n\nTo apply to adopt Penny, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

She is SUPER human oriented dog, she is even a lap dog, will kiss you to death, very obedient, very kind...adores humans of all ages..toddlers are safe around her..she will be a perfect nanny...no wild jumps or attitude shown. Lady may have a confrontation with other dogs or cats ..not with aggression but a curiosity and irritation. We rescued her from Florida high-kill shelter just a couple hours before her scheduled euthanasia. So, the perfect family for her would be a family with no dogs or cats. Great on a leash, may pull a bit but is controllable. Totally housebroken, not picky in food choices, healthy, vaccinated up to the date, spayed. We checked her teeth...not a good news...but the surgery is scheduled and is under our rescue Dire Straits Paws supervision.  We will arrange her surgery for some teeth extraction and will cover the vet bills. We provide 2 weeks trial before an adoption is finalized. We will deliver the dog to your house for a meet and greet following all the safety rules. Please send your requests to dsprescue@gmail.com with a note Lady if interested.  An application to adopt and a fee apply. More videos and pictures are available. Thank you !",

            "description": "AVAILABLE FOR FOSTER to ADOPT\nPLEASE read this BIOGRAPHY CAREFULLY.  It will answer most of your questions including why Georgia Liberty is Foster-to-Adopt.\n\nHouse Trained?  Yes\nCrate Trained?   Yes\nGood on Leash? Yes\nEnergy Level?     Medium\nGood with other nice dogs?   Yes\nGood with Adults?  yes\nGood with Older Children?  Yes\n\nGEORGIA LIBERTY, named after one of the best states in the USA, is the perfect package!  She is just old enough at 1.5 years old to not be considered a puppy, so she has outgrown chewing things and is completely house-trained.  She is the perfect medium-sized dog, and full grown. \n\nGEORGIA is one smart and beautiful dog with very nice manners to match! She is very intelligent and knows how to sit and take treat very gently from your hand.  She has a happy and extremely sweet personality.  At times, she still gets bursts of puppy energy and wants to do \"zoomies,\" but is also content to relax next to you.  Georgia is crate trained, potty trained, and is learning to walk well on a leash.  Many nights, she puts herself to bed in her crate, and she sleeps quietly all night until her foster mom opens the door in the morning. \n\nShe gets very excited around meal time and as soon as she sees her bowl, she runs and waits patiently for her food in her crate like a good girl.   Georgia likes to play with other nice dogs and would be fine as an only dog or with other dogs. Her current foster home has 3 other dogs and Georgia gets along with all of them.    \n\nGeorgia loves all people.  She has three older children /teens in her foster home and enjoys following them around.  She would be fine with younger children too, but she is still learning to not jump on people when they first meet her.  A small child may accidentally get jumped on with no intention of hurting. Georgia's foster mom has been using a spray bottle with water to deter this behavior, and she is learning quickly.  \n\nWhat is FOSTER TO ADOPT, you ask?  When a dog has not yet been altered (spayed or neutered) due to a medical treatment that is in process, but there is someone that wants to bring that dog into their family as an adopted family member, we approve the adopter as a FOSTER HOME, complete the medical treatment and spay, and then finalize the adoption.\n\nThis will allow GEORGIA LIBERTY to be placed with her forever family so there is no delay in the bonding process while You Lucky Dog Rescue remains responsible for the completion of the remaining vetting needs.\n\nWhat is GEORGIA's MEDICAL CONDITION?  She is heart worm positive - very common with shelter dogs as in most cases, their former humans just didn't care enough to provide them with monthly heart worm preventative.  Like any parasite, medical treatment will take care of those nasty worms, but it is a process. As soon as her treatment is completed, Georgia will be spayed. We can then finalize your adoption of Georgia.  \n\nShe will need a nurturing family to care for her during treatment as her activity level will need to be restricted during that time.  If you have another dog in the home,  you will need to keep her separated from active play with other dogs - JUST UNTIL  treatment is completed. After treatment, she can resume normal play and other exercise activities.\n \nIf you Foster-To-Adopt Georgia, you will be fully supported by our volunteers that have all been through the heart worm treatment process with other dogs.  And, we cover the expense of treatment!  100%.\n\nGeorgia has an estimated DOB of 7/14/19 and is believed to be a \nLab Retriever/American Staffordshire Terrier mix.  She weighed 58 pounds  at her last vet visit. \n\nIf you live in the Greater Metro ATL, GA area and are interested in  Fostering To \nAdopt Georgia, please email us at info@youluckydogrescue.org and visit our website to submit an online FOSTER APPLICATION - we cover all medical/vetting expenses, supply a loaner crate, if needed.  We also provide leash/collars/tag and monthly heart worm and flea preventatives until the adoption is finalized. - as well as the cost of heart worm treatment.\n\nFOSTER APPLICATION:  YOULUCKYDOGRESCUE.ORG\n\nQUESTIONS - yep, we know you got 'em!  Email us at info@youluckydogrescue.org\n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay  or neuter and microchipping.   The breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog.  We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue.  We are located in the metro Atlanta area.   We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.",

She showed up with a broke leg that healed incorrectly, and bb pellets in her leg. Her leg required amputation because her previous owner allowed it to heal so poorly, it wasn\u2019t fixable.\n\nShe is approximately 3 years old, 50lbs, short in stature, compact, but beefy. She is GREAT with children, and she doesn\u2019t let her missing leg slow her down.\n\nRecently she has developed some leash reactivity to other dogs and needs a confident handler to help her work through these issues when she sees other dogs in public. Initially she was great with other dogs in our rescue, so we have faith she can get back to that point,\n\nShe is crate trained. Walks well on leash, and she knows her basic commands.\n\nCheck out more on her here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDIxODk1MjkxMzAyNzgw?igshid=1afisl5nl65zj\n\nCheck out her IG here:\nhttps://instagram.com/_diamondintheruff3?igshid=u9t6nj1jhl7s\n\nIf you would like to meet her, you must fill out an adoption application on our website at: \n\nwww.californiabullyrescue.org/adopt\n\nAdoption fee is $495 for all of our dogs, regardless of age, breed, or ability :) \n",

He just needs to have new dogs introduced before he knows if they are going to be friends. He is a high energy dog, so small children would probably be knocked down. \n\nWalks good on a leash and is a easy going kinda guy. He does have food allergies, but it is easily managed with the right dog food. He is also good on a leash.\n\nIf you are interested in Duke, please call us at 541-662-2062 or visit us on our Facebook page- https://www.facebook.com/ReedsportK9/\n\nFacebook is much faster than phone.\n\nTo see a dog you are interested in, an application must first be filled out. Applications can be found by clicking on the large purple paw above our name on the right hand side of the web page. This takes you to another page. On the right-hand side is a link with the words \"Adoption Application\". Please click here, fill it out, and send it to the above email address.

She is great with other dogs and does not appear bothered by cat either.  She does have some separation anxiety which will be assessed at her DRG foster home.\n\nLexie is now fostered in Oklahoma and in the care of Doberman Rescue Group.\n\nTo apply for any of our dogs - http://www.dobermanrescuegroup.org/adopt.htm \nEmails, questions or posts from Petfinder do not go to the adoption team - please visit our website to be considered. \n\n",

A Pup Squad adopter spotted her and started working to gain her trust through patience and snacks. It was a very slow process which gained increased urgency when we realized Gentry was pregnant. Unfortunately, she was not cooperative. She'd come into the yard to hang out and even use the crate and blankets when it was cold, or rainy, but as soon as people got close, she was outta there.\n\nThen, Gentry chose to have her babies right there, so we were able to scoop her and her babies up and get them inside. Gentry raised a litter of gorgeous pups who all quickly found their forever homes. So, we started working with Gentry to help her get ready for her forever home.\n\nGentry has been staying at a special rescue boarding facility where she has doggy friends who have helped her learn that humans aren't so bad after all. \n\nGentry is still shy with people, but she's come such a long way. She is ready for her forever home.  Gentry definitely needs at least one doggy friend and she needs a quiet home with patient humans.\n\nGentry's approx. DOB is 6/1/2018.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted via the online form http://pupsquad.org/adopt/adoption-application.html.\n\nDuring COVID 19 - We may not be able to help coordinate transport out of state due to limited resources on our end and limited transport options to get the dogs to destinations outside of Texas.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org\n",

            "description": "MAXWELL\nShepherd Mix\n(DOB: 05/28/20)\n\nIntroducing Maxwell. He is a young Shepherd mix and weighs just under 20 lbs. Maxwell is so handsome and look at those ears \u2013 super cute. Maxwell is a beautiful, loving, playful boy.\n\nMaxwell's favorite toys are a Nylabone that looks like a stick and a Kong ball. He enjoys the company of other dogs \u2013 he plays well with others, although he is known to swipe a toy or two from his foster fur-buddies. He's pretty strong for his size. \n\nMaxwell's most endearing habit/quality is his strong cuddle game. He is a total cuddle-bug! \n\n3 words to describe Maxwell's personality:\n1. Energetic\n2. Smart\n3. Cuddly\n\nMaxwell is working on his basic obedience skills. His foster family have already trained him to SIT and play FETCH. He is crate-trained and house-trained (except when it's raining). He knows his name and will come when called.\n\nSome things Maxwell is still working on:  Shoes \u2013 he is fascinated with shoes.  He can find every single one in the house that hasn't been put away! Maxwell is also working on eating independently. Sometimes his foster mom will hand feed him to get him started.\n\nMaxwell is a little unsure around new people. He is a bit stand offish at first, but once he's sees that you're ok, he comes right up. Maxwell likes women better than men.\n\nMaxwell is great with kids and loves to play with them. He is up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped and being maintained on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. \n\nSome nicknames we call Maxwell are:\nMax\nMaxi\nMaximilian\n\nOur best time of day together is evening/night. After dinner we go for a walk with the other fur-friends in the house. Then its playtime followed by a good cuddle session then off to bed.\n\nMaxwell needs an understanding owner who can work with him to become more independent and who has time to be home with him for part of the day.\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered as part of Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue. An application is required, along with a home visit and small adoption fee.  Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. **FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED**\n\nPlease visit us on our Facebook page for additional photos, give us a like while you're there! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondsintheruffNC\n\nAll of our dogs are fostered in homes and are INDOOR dogs. We believe all dogs are family members and should be treated as valued members of the household. \n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines for further information on adopting from Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue before submitting an application. www.DITRnc.com.\n\n\n.",

He then landed on the euthanasia list where he almost lost his life.  \n\nFortunately he was saved because an amazing woman offered to foster him.\n\nThis is what she says about him:\n\nBj is a great dog, housetrained, and no destruction. Very well behaved in the house. No accidents. Quiet as can be. If someone knocks at the door he does however have a very strange bark. Not loud but strange...lol. kinda like someone who has lost their voice.\nOutside bj loves to run around the yard. If you start playing with him be prepared for this little tank to run and jump, sometimes right into you. Loves rope toys and doing zoomies. I would not recommend cats, he isn't a cat lover. No small dogs or young children with him. He would run them over by accident. He's a solidly built bulldog and runs into you with an impact.\n\nMy perfect home for him would be a young, active couple with a patient man.  At first, bj will shy away from men and growl. He's afraid of them. With patience and understanding, he does come around, then He's all love and plays. Loves belly rubs.\n\nHe is UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, neutered, and ready to go!\n\n",

            "description": "Marvel is a 1.5 year old, male, 60 lb, American Staffordshire Terrier/American Bulldog mix. He is crate, house, and leash trained!\nHe is a very high energy boy who would love to be an only child and someone's running or jogging partner. He is great with everyone he meets and is such a cuddle bug. He loves jumping on the sofa with you to watch some tv but also loves a great game of fetch.\nHe loves all types of toys but b\nall gives him life!\n\nHe's a dominate boy who needs a strong assertive owner to give him boundaries and limits. He would excel at any dog sport so being in any teams would be a plus! He\njust completed some amazing training with Tail to Tail Training to give him a solid foundation and they are even willing to donate\na 1 to 2 hour refresher course to show an adopter what he's learned and how to handle him so he can reach his full potential. He isn't the biggest fan of other dogs only dogs that are submissive and lower energy.\n\nHis high prey drive that gives him an edge in dog sports makes him difficult to have around cats or small animals. That also makes him a bit of an escape artist if he chases a cat or squirrel up and over a fence. He's currently loving leashed walks for going potty and fetch out on leash with a long line/tether. Kids would need to be older and able to hold their own against his zoomies when he's excited.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Marvel, please apply at\nwww.hhfrescue.org\n.\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

We believe he might have been and outside dog only.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\nThi\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in (DOG'S NAME) or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

Are you active and love to HIKE, run, or go for loooooong walks?! If you know my type of dog, you know how incredibly intelligent I am and ALWAYS looking to WORK!! I like to work, but I'm also said to be THE BEST cuddler out there! I am incredibly loyal and loving to the females in my home, but I am very weary of men. There's a high index of suspicion that I may have been abused, so I am in need of someone who will help work with me to get over my fear of men. I am set to go to a board and train program, but I need my next placement set up before I can go to training. I LOVE other dogs, but I'm not trustworthy with other small animals/creatures!   At this time, a home without kids is best.\n\nSooooo, what do you say.. we go for a long hike, spend a little time reinforcing my training and then go for a major cuddle session on the couch?! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Foster Notes September 2017:\n\nOverall Adonis was a great boy, he really is a sweetheart. He only needs minor work with house manners. After our evening walks, he would eat dinner and play a bit of fetch in the yard. We would all come back inside and he'd settle down nicely as we ate our dinner. We set up a baby gate to create boundaries during the day while our baby is walking around and playing. He would sleep in the house in a large crate in the hallway near our bedroom. My nephews (12 & 15) and sister in law came over to meet him on Tuesday, he was awesome. Very playful, gentle, friendly. I made him wait by the baby gate upon entrance, then by the door, on the side in a down/stay, when they left. He managed well, the treat helped :) No accidents in house. At meal time we put him in a down stay just a couple of feet away from dinner table, it takes a couple of tries, but then he stays. We have a neighbor that works in his yard, Adonis gave a couple of barks, when I called him he stopped and didn't bother again. We have another neighbor with a feisty boxer who stuck his nose under the fence, Adonis barked, then got into a playful position. I called him, he came over and left the dog alone. He did ok walking with me and the stroller. He was trying to keep up with the stroller, would bump it and stumble a bit, so I was working with him to stay near my side. He kept rubbing the gentle leader to try to get it off. I was working with him \"don't rub\" to leave it alone. Not sure if he did that with you guys. \nNo other dogs in the home. \n\nHe rode well in the rear compartment of the Ford Edge, no anxiety or whining , but about 10 minutes from the house he got excited and wanted to join us, so he tried to make his way over the back seat. He should probably ride in a carrier. We bathed him the day we got him at pet food express, he was perfect. I left him for an hour in the backyard when I went to the store, he was fine when I returned.\n\nAdonis is a lover once he gets to know you - happy, eager and likes to give \"hugs\" to new friends. He is in need of puppy obedience classes and would excel due to his smart and attentive nature. Adonis walks well on leash and listens when you talk to him or ask him to sit. He travels well in a car and loves people. He likes dogs who match his play style & has good recall. Walks beautifully on leash with a gentle leader and will be a great companion to anyone looking for a pal. This handsome boy needs exercise, socialization with other dogs and a shep savvy home to love him!",

This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Update : Jesse is beginning to relax but seems to be more relaxed around women than men. Sudden movements startle him. If left alone he will approach people for treats and to be leashed but he is like a deer, the slightest movement might startle him so slow and steady is best.\n\nAny potential adopters will have to meet him and work with him several times before he could be adopted and agree to follow the transition program to help Jesse settle in smoothly.\n\nJesse is a very sweet boy and has a very playful nature .......but his transition has to be slow so he can build up trust with his adopter. He will only be adopted to a home without children and with experience with under socialized German Shepherds .\n\nUPDATE : JESSE is still very confused and will need additional time to decompress . He is beginning to take treats and takes them very gently.\n\nOnce he has become a bit more relaxed around us we will be able to introduce him .\n\nHe will need a quiet home, older kids or no kids since he has not lived with them, and adopters who have some familiarity with super shy dogs.\n\nJesse was very much loved but his human passed away unexpectedly and no one in the family could take him. Rather than take him to a shelter they reached out for rescue help and we were so happy we could take him.\n\nVolunteers picked him up in NC and brought him here to MD . All who have met him say he is affectionate and warms up quickly.\n\nJesse is very sweet but understandably a little confused with all the changes in his life.\n\nWe will post updates soon and allow him time to decompress and relax in his new surroundings .\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com. Our adoption fee is $350.00.",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies under 1 year of age.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

            "description": "Hi, are you looking for the most loyal, best buddy in the whole world?  And do have an enormous amount of patience?  If so, let me introduce you to Dodger.  He\u2019s a 6-7 year old golden mix.  He has all the loving, loyal traits of a golden retriever- always happy to see you.  Never wants to leave your side, loves his toys, and is just a goofy, super loving boy.  He walks amazing well on a leash when he is by himself, but is not as good when his foster brothers come too!  He just gets so excited!  \n\nHe had a very rough past and unfortunately has some nuances that will probably never go away (hence the patience needed with him!). His one challenge is he is fecal incontinent.  He doesn\u2019t seems to be able to feel it when he starts to \u201cgo\u201d and once he starts, he can\u2019t stop it.  His foster home keeps him on a strict diet to make sure his stool stays firm and easy to pick up, and he\u2019s on a  pretty regular schedule, but you do need to stay outside with him while he goes.  \n\nHe will need to go to a home with another dog, as he take his  cues from other dogs.  He  would do best without cats or other fun small creatures to chase.   And he loves to roam certain rooms in the house- he is not a dog who can be crated\n\nWe require an application, phone interview and home visit prior to adoption. We will not discuss a specific dog with an applicant until the adoption process is completed. Our adoption fee for dogs under 8 months is $300, dogs between 9 months and 7 years is $250 and our super seniors are $125. Please visit our website for more information. Thank you!",

            "special_needs_notes": "Hi, are you looking for the most loyal, best buddy in the whole world?  And do have an enormous amount of patience?  If so, let me introduce you to Dodger.  He\u2019s a 6-7 year old golden mix.  He has all the loving, loyal traits of a golden retriever- always happy to see you.  Never wants to leave your side, loves his toys, and is just a goofy, super loving boy.  He walks amazing well on a leash when he is by himself, but is not as good when his foster brothers come too!  He just gets so excited!  \n\nHe had a very rough past and unfortunately has some nuances that will probably never go away (hence the patience needed with him!). His one challenge is he is fecal incontinent.  He doesn\u2019t seems to be able to feel it when he starts to \u201cgo\u201d and once he starts, he can\u2019t stop it.  His foster home keeps him on a strict diet to make sure his stool stays firm and easy to pick up, and he\u2019s on a  pretty regular schedule, but you do need to stay outside with him while he goes.  \n\nHe will need to go to a home with another dog, as he take his  cues from other dogs.  He  would do best without cats or other fun small creatures to chase.   And he loves to roam certain rooms in the house- he is not a dog who can be crated",

            "description": "Skyee is a smart and playful young female who has been at our shelter for almost 10 months. A previous owner said Skyee had amazing house manners - house trained, no counter surfing, and only chewed on her toys. She likes rope and rubber toys and plays gently both by herself and with people. Skyee is also a big fan of splashing around in water, and knows sit, come, and shake. Skyee is loved by both staff and volunteers, who describe her as sweet and easy in the playyard. Skyee has a rough and rowdy play style with other dogs, but she has found a few doggy friends here at the shelter that she enjoys playing with. But Skyee needs a special home. Skyee gets really worked up on leash when she's passing people and dogs. She is insecure around people she doesn't know and needs a savvy owner with a low-traffic home to help her learn how to meet strangers and gain confidence and manners on leash.

Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Roxy is approximately 3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nRoxy is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. She is a ball of energy that loves to go outside and play and goof off. She loves everyone she encounters and wants an owner just as outgoing as she is! \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Roxy, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

            "description": "Ollie's big, eyeliner-defined eyes will mesmerize you, watch out: he's just drawing you in for lots of belly rubs and petting! This young Pyr boy can't get enough loving from his humans, he loves children of all ages, and his knowledge of commands is sure to impress! Over the past few months, he's shown what a focused and quick learner he is. His foster mom has taught him a myriad of commands, from the basic \"sit\", \"watch\" and \"down\", to \"drop it\", \"leave it\" and \"crate\", and he responds to both verbal and some hand signals. His original owners reluctantly surrendered him because he had separation anxiety when they went back to work and although he's learning that people may leave for short periods of time and he will still be safe, his best home will be one where someone is home for the vast majority of the day. And if you have to go out, he understands \"go for a ride\"; just say \"load up!\" because he LOVES to ride in the car! This boy is gentle and respectful of children, fine with cats and other dogs (big and small), and loves playing with his dog friends. With new adults, he's a bit shy and needs a slower introduction by his owner. Being young, Ollie still has the puppy play drive - he plays with toys, including tug-of-war with his foster sister, and even the occasional fetch, but as a maturing teenager he will occasionally test the limits by nosing the counter or table for tidbits, or diving into the garbage can, and per his purebred pyr heritage, guarding his \"flock\". He is watchful over the children in the foster's home, stepping in when someone bigger plays rough with them, and tends to want to protect his foster mom more than dad on walks. He will require an owner with Pyr experience to guide him through his juvenile years, refine his serious guarding instincts, and a canine sister of similar size to play with and match his youthful energy. Ollie has shown himself to be an athletic climber, so will need a 6-ft. privacy fence with no support bars on the inside. He enjoys being outside and getting some zoomies in during the day, but mostly he prefers being inside with his people being a huge cuddle-bug :) \n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He also prefers women to men. \n\n\n Thanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home. For more information, visit our website www.canerossorescue.org\nor email us at rescue@canerosso.com.",

Ice loves the outdoors and would be great with someone who also loves the outdoors! He loves car rides, we are positive he lives for them! Ice is a sweet boy who loves to nuzzle his big head into your leg or shoulder for some love. He adores a bed, and won\u2019t move from it unless you ask him too. Ice does need a family that can take control. He wants to be top dog, and clear boundaries will need to be set with him from day 1. He does love other dogs, and likes to romp around with them! He is a leash puller, but has been introduced to a training collar that is helping. We are unsure if Ice is house trained, but he never uses the bathroom in his kennel and never offers to tear anything up. Ice is extremely food motivated and very smart. He will sit, down, shake, and wait. Please apply at www.partnerscanines.org.",

He was nursed back to health in foster care and gets along beautifully with the other dogs and people in the foster home.\n\n \n\n Chief has the most amazing loving eyes; when he looks at you with those kind brown eyes, it is almost impossible to resist the desire to love and take care of him. He is remarkably mellow and docile\u2014happiest at the \u201cback of the pack,\u201d so to speak; when others are in control so he can just be himself. \n\n \n\nAlthough he has physically recovered, Chief still has anxiety which manifests outside (ie. whining, pulling, reactivity towards strange dogs). His foster mom has been working with a dog behaviorist. Chief has made excellent progress and enjoying his walks much more. \n\nChief needs an experienced dog owner who can provide calmness and security, and is willing to complete training with the behaviorist if needed. Additionally, Chief needs a 30-minute daily walk, weekly new experiences, and continued socialization with other animals and people. He can live with other dogs and cats. Chief does well around his foster mom's small grandchildren, but simply due to his size, he would do best in a home without young children.\n\nChief is neutered, microchipped, and up to date in his vaccination. His adoption fee is $400",

I play with other dogs, but I must be the only dog in your home. I get toy and good aggressive with another dog. Older children would be best. I was heartworm positive when I came in, but the shelter already paid for all my treatment. I'm all done now and just take normal heartworm preventative like any other dog. Please call my adoption coordinator Alexandra 330-261-3934 if you can rescue me. My adoption donation is $150 and includes neuter, UTD vaccines, heartworm treatment, and microchip.",

She\u2019s approximately 3 years old and 60 pounds. \n\nSadly, 2020 wasn't a good year for her either. She was diagnosed with heartworm disease and has been undergoing treatment for it. The treatment is a long, slow and painful process but luckily the heartworms are not spreadable to other animals. We are searching for a foster or foster-to-adopt home for her. \n\nSadie has to be on strict exercise restriction to prevent any further problems as the heartworms slowly die. She needs a calm home where she can relax and go on leashed walks to potty while she heals from this disease. A home without cats is probably best as they excite her and cause her to show off that unique baying bark of hers. Luckily, she does great on leash and is easy to walk. She also is a huge foodie but she knows to \u201csit\u201d and would love to learn more for treats. She just wants someone to love on her and not be alone through this treatment. \nIf interested in making Sadie\u2019s New Year's wish come true, please email us at humanecherokeecounty@gmail.com or call and leave a message at 918-457-7997.\nIf you can\u2019t foster but would like to help with her treatment, we would be extremely grateful for donations as well. This treatment is very expensive and we couldn\u2019t help these sweet animals without the help of our community. Donations can be mailed to HSCC P.O. Box 1354, Tahlequah, OK 74465 or you can do so through PayPal.",

            "description": "Husky\nMale\n7 year(s) old\n55 lbs.\nBlue eyes\nBlack-White fur coat\nPossibly good with dogs, not with cats\nPossibly good with kids\nNormal energy level\n\nChicago came to us a few years ago but had some issues to work on. Now he is ready to find his furever after. Chicago loves being around people and will call to volunteers from his kennel asking them to say hello. He is very smart, lives for food but isn't always persuaded by it when he just wants to go for a walk! Chicago would do best in a quieter household and will require a strong handed and minded owner as well as someone with husky experience.  The key to Chicago is time and patience, it will go a long way with him.\n\nPlease know that at this time, husky experience is required for the adoption of Chicago.\n\n \nSpecial Training:\nFree Spirit Siberian Rescue cannot make any guarantee regarding the outcome of any dog being adopted out to household with cats or small animals. The owner assumes full responsibility for the dog\u2019s behavior and, per the requirement of the adoption contract, will enroll the dog(s) in obedience classes to aid in the process. \n\n If interested in this adorable canine please begin the adoption process by filling out an adoption application. Visit us on our website at www.huskyrescue.org/adoption-process for adoption applications. \n\nIMPORTANT: You will receive a confirmation email from one of our coordinators once we have received your application. Do NOT attempt to submit multiple times. If you haven't received an email from us within 72 hours, please send an email to us at: freespiritsiberianrescue@gmail.com \n\nCheck out our website for more photos of available dogs at www.huskyrescue.org Free Spirit Siberian Rescue a 501c3 All Breed Shelter . We are a no-kill, 501(c)(3), non-profit animal rescue. All donations made to Free Spirit Siberian Rescue are tax deductible. So you can't adopt or volunteer, but really want to help?

PLEASE FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, ONCE PRE-APPROVED, GIVE US A CALL AND WE CAN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO MEET ME!\n\nI am 27 lbs., 7 months old, and l am looking for my forever home. Toby is a special needs puppy due to a trauma that damaged the tail end of his spinal cord. Because of this, Toby does not have feeling in his hind end and tail and is incontinent.\n\nAdoption Donation: $400\n\nNote from his former foster: Toby is the best dog ever! Friendly, conversational, and cuddly! Toby loves taking walks but does not see much of the scenery because his nose never leaves the ground. He is learning to \"sit\" and \"stay\". At the end of the day, however, he will put himself to bed in his crate. He appreciates a cozy blanket or fleece and loves to snuggle with his dinosaur flannel. He loves to play tug-o-war with his spider, a rope, or stick and enjoys a good chew (but never once touched the furniture). He also likes other dogs. He loves to be outside in the sunshine and spent many days snoozing on our patio. \n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus; Vectra 3D.\n\nAll household members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available.  As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

He's a sweet, loving boy who loves attention and is very laid-back. He does need a home with no other dogs or cats, and a standard 4-6 foot tall fence. Buddy was found as a stray and when he was picked up you could see every bone in his body and down his backbone. He's doing very well since CILRA rescued him and placed him in a good foster home. He still needs to gain about 10-15 more pounds and shed the old fur coat and get a new fur coat on. This sweet and lovable dog is house-trained, crate-trained, and is just very easy going. He's the perfect Lab and can't wait to find his forever home. Buddy is fostered in Brazil, IN, just one hour west of Indianapolis.\n",

He is your man. You want someone to be your new best friend? He is your guy. Now Lazlo is very high energy, so he would only get along with a female dog, that could match that.

He's All Shook Up and looking for his furever home. He loves to run and play in his Blue Suede Shoes, and then snuggle up for a little Love me Tender cuddles. Don't Be Cruel and come meet Elvis today and you Can't Help Falling in Love.\n\nWe work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered for free.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n\n",

Leila has had a very rough start to life and has been working very hard with a behaviorist to erase the remnants of that life. Leila absolutely loves other dogs and she must have a doggy sibling in her forever home. Her forever place will be a single famiy home in a quiet neighborhood with a fenced in yard and no young children.\nLeila is crate trained and house trained, but she wants nothing to do with a leash. She\ncan be talkative. Leila is a bit reserved when meeting new people and she is hoping to meet someone who understands\nit might take her a little while to warm up. Once she is comfortable, she'll love you forever!\nLeila needs a very experienced owner who will commit to continued training. Leila is a work in progress, but with the right person, she will flourish and the investment will have been well worth it! We know that special person is out there for Leila. If that's you, please apply online to adopt Leila at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He came into rescue with another female Pyrenees girl from a crowded shelter when they were nor reclaimed. We were able to get both dogs safe in the nick of time. Tyson is a good boy who will sit for treats and he takes direction well. He would be a great companion for leash walks and hikes as he is more energetic than the average full Pyr. He is also a nice size at 65 pounds. Tyson loves to play with toys and it's so fun to watch him throw a ball up in the air and try to catch it! He would do fine with a female companion or he would do well as an only dog. He does like to chase cats so a cat free home would be best. Tyson is a great dog - we just love him and so will you!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

(: I love to play with all kinds of toys and have tons of energy so will need an active family. After I get it all out though, I make a great snuggler. I am also dog friendly with proper introduction, and totally crate trained. I know my basic commands too! And, I'm doing better on the leash every day. I would do best in a home with older children, due to my energy level.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n---------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heartworm test, health certificate, and transport costs. \nAs an Apollo direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).

            "description": "Roscoe is a 9-month-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to Colorado's Safer At Home policies and to abide by social distancing protocols, we are HIGHLY encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. All adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically, should you want to proceed forward with the adoption. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

My foster mom's best guess is some blend of shepherd/lab. I am potty trained, behave well in the house, know basic commands, and walk well on a gentle leader. I came from Texas. I should not be in a family with kids or small critters, including cats. I have a strong prey drive and like to chase moving things. I love people, get along with other dogs with appropriate introductions, am very good in my kennel, enjoy car rides, and recently discovered I love the snow!\n\nI am such a lover! I will get very excited to see you when you come home and will reach out for hugs and kisses while my entire body wiggles with joy! I love to follow my people around all over the house like a shadow. I would be best in a with not a lot of activity going on around the environment like dogs/people walking by. That would make me feel most safe. I love to play with other dogs, and luckily my golden retriever foster brothers have taught me a lot about how to read other dogs boundaries. I've grown leaps and bounds!\n\nI think I lacked stimulation in my early life, so I made up my own games-chasing light and shadows. But my foster mom recognized this as not healthy and gives me treat balls, stimulating toys, plenty of exercise, and redirects me when I do this so that I learn to focus on other things. I am on medication to help my brain not get so worked up to begin with, and this has made me feel so much better! I'd rather snuggle now or play with my toys than chase lights.\n\nI love people and despite not having a stable environment for the first 10 months of my life. I have a huge desire to trust, love and live life with so much joy! I almost always have a smile on my face and a wag in my tail. I am super smart and quick to learn how to please you. I can't wait to not have to worry about feeling safe and loved by giving someone who understands my needs my undying loyalty and love.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

Bowser is not as energitic as his young son, Draven, so he would do well in a home with children with good supervision.  \n\nIf you would like to come meet Bowser or reserve him as your own once he is ready, please visit our website www.shannonfarmz.org and fill our an adoption application.",

She is fine with dogs and kids. She was tested with a cat and she chased it but didn't hurt it. She loves to play so she would make a great addition to a low or medium active family. She is house trained but may need a refresher.\nShe is available for foster or adoption. We do have a two week trial where we can loan a leash, collar and crate. She is utd on shots, spayed, microchipped and heartworm tested***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

He is a good boy and we feel bad for him. He would do best in a home with no stairs (inside or outside), one level living and a fenced yard. Because of his blindness, he can't/won't walk on a leash. Elliot does well in the big bed. He either sleeps on you or right up next to you but doesn't like to be disturbed! At home he likes to walk with his body up against your legs so he knows where you are and where he is going. He sometimes bumps into walls and goes into rooms and has a hard time getting out. You have to shake his dish and put it under his nose so he can find it. He likes other dogs but not cats. We prefer an all-adult home for Elliot with a small dog buddy his ager, a secure fenced yard and no cats or children. He will need a lot of patience as he settles in to his new home. It's not easy being an old blind nearly deaf dog and having to make changes. Won't you consider adding Elliott to your family?  Applicants must be willing to drive to Ellicott City, Maryland (10 miles south of Baltimore) to meet and adopt Elliott.****  Want to know more about Elliott - no fee for 60+ adopter?

She and her brother Jaxx were found as strays. We don\u2019t know anything about their past beyond that, but we do know that we so badly want the perfect home for Gidget. \n\nGidget is terrified of new situations and needs time to settle into her surroundings. She is shy by nature and her response to new stimuli is to try to escape it. Based on this, we really do believe that she and her brother had to run to survive prior to coming to us. They are warriors. Gidget needs a family or individual that will love her for who she is and allow her to adjust to life as a treasured member of the family on her own terms. \n\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

            "description": "Est DOB: 09/2017\nCurrent weight: 49 lbs\nAlpha had a rough start to life - he and his brother Beta were found living behind a supermarket in North Katy. His finders brought the Alpha and Beta into the rescue and we were grateful to find out Alpha was heartworm negative!\nAlpha is now neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccination. While we don't know what happened to him before he was found, we do think he was previously abused as he is very nervous of strangers on first greeting. After he gets to know you, he opens up - he loves to give hugs, cuddle on the couch, and play ball. He's also a good running partner!\nDue to his initial nervousness, Alpha did compete a 4 week board and train class where he learned all sorts of cool things like how to better handle meet and greets, sit, heel, and place. His training comes with free lifetime one on one sessions!\nWhile Alpha enjoyed playing with Beta, he isn't as interested in other dogs and would be best as an only pet.\nWe are looking for an experienced dog owner that has the patience to let Alpha become comfortable with them - and be rewarded with an extremely loyal and loving dog. He would do best in a home with adults and no cats. While he would enjoy a yard, he would also do fine in an apartment setting as he likes to chill on the couch.\nPlease consider making this handsome boy a member of your family and contact us to arrange to meet him. More information about the adoption process and an adoption application can be found at https://almosthomepetrescue.org. An application form can be found on the website: https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1 and is required to be approved for any meet and greet and adoption as Almost Home Pet Rescue is a foster based rescue.\n$150 adoption fee covers spay/neuter surgery, heartworm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, micro chip and registration, wormer, flea and heartworm prevention while the dog is in our care.",

We are currently working on getting her on the right dosage before she is available for foster.\n\nLittle parvo survivor, Ladybug was released from hospitalization September 25th! So far Lady seems to be a little bit timid and always eager for human attention. She's not really interested in her foster siblings or toys... yet. She is doing really well with pottying outside or making it to the potty pad. Lady will be ready for adoption October 23rd. In the meantime, she'll be getting some post-parvo TLC and we will update you with more information about this sweet girl's personality.",

He gets along great with kids but it would be best if no small children were in the home. He loves playing and would be a wonderful hiking buddy. He is full of energy and needs someone who will exercise with him and take him for long walks. He likes to play with tennis balls and squeaky toys. He likes to snuggle on the couch too. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. \n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

My owner moved away and didn\u2019t take me with her so I came to Halfway to Home to find the forever home I deserve.  I am a low-maintenance boy in a cute package!  I am not terribly active so I only need a short walk or two a day to keep my joints healthy.  My lower jaw looks kind of funky which slows me down a bit while I am eating, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t affect me at all.  My ideal home would be a quiet place without children with owners who like to cuddle. Condos or apartments are fine by me, but if you live on an upper floor you may need to carry me!   I am probably ok with other dogs, but it is important that we meet first to make sure we are compatible. I am not sure how I would do with cats.  Please don\u2019t dismiss me because I am older.  Senior dogs are great companions because the most important thing to us is to be with owners who have a lot of love to give, and we will return it.  Thank you for reading about me, and if you would like more information or an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele# 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).",

NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in. (Please know this is not a guarantee). We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4480604.\n\nWhen Nellie first came to the shelter, she was very scared and timid and didn't understand why she was there. She was very wary of the kennel staff and didn't want to interact with them. The kennel staff kept working with her and she is doing so much better. She is easy to leash in her kennel and walks out to the play yard without any issues. Her last time out of the kennel, she was playful and bouncy walking to the play yard. She was calm, wanted to be petted and the staff found out that she knows sit, shake and down for treats. She walked back to her kennel with ease. She just needed some time to understand that the staff was there to help her and take care of her.\n\nWhen Nellie was in the play yard with other dogs, she was tolerant of the dogs and she enjoyed laying in the shade with another timid dog. Nellie needs an adopter that understands her start at the shelter and that she's nervous when she meets new people, but once she gets to know you, she'll be ready to show you the tricks that she knows. Just make sure you have some treats. If you already have a dog at home, bring them with you to meet Nellie! Come and meet her today!\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Mia was an owner surrender, she would do best in a home with no other dogs or cats. She does good with older children but no young kids. She loves hanging around her humans and running. She would do great as a hiking partner!\n\n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. \n\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

He is more than content to be at the foot of your bed as long as he can sleep in your room. He gets anxieties from being in a crate so he is not kenneled in his foster home. Mac will need a fenced in yard, if he is put out on a chain he will do whatever he can to get freed from it and once freed he will chase bunnies, dogs or whatever it is that likes to run past with no recall. Mac LOVES car rides and will be the best behaved traveler if you will let him go with. He is leash trained and will go for as long of a walk as you want. Mac is dog friendly, good with people of all ages, and housetrained. To sum him up, he\u2019s nothing but a good ole boy. He is neutered, heartworm tested, microchipped, and up-to-date on vaccinations. His adoption fee is $135. If interested in Mac please click on the link below to complete an adoption application\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/50308432400137\n\nPlease note: Mac is in a foster home and is available to meet by appointment only with an approved adoption application. Please call 712 253 8394 with questions about our adoption process.",

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nLoki is a very handsome little 1 year-old Cattle Dog with beautiful markings. He was surrendered to a county dog shelter by his owner because of his high prey drive--chasing cats and chickens. Loki has done well with other dogs in his foster home, but will try to herd them which is true to his breed. Loki needs an active person or mature family who'll give him a job to do every day. He would make an excellent trail buddy once he gains a little more experience on the leash. Loki has done well with crate-training in his foster home and should be able to pick up the house rules quickly in his new home. He would not do well left alone for long workdays and needs a big fenced yard (aboveground fence only--no invisible fence) to play in along with a canine buddy to pal around with. Loki is a very smart dog who picks up new routines quickly. He loved having his photos taken and made great eye contact with the camera. In addition to plenty of physical exercise each day, Loki needs lots of mental stimulation as well to keep him sharp and engaged. If you're an experienced Cattle Dog person looking for your next buddy, Loki might be the dog for you. Loki was adopted from us shortly after he arrived here but was returned after several weeks because he became very protective of his home and family. He was not welcoming of visitors to the home and exhibited leash reactivity with other dogs when on walks in the neighborhood. He needs a quiet home in a more rural area without close neighbors and few visitors. He becomes very attached to his people and isn't able to handle busy urban or suburban environments. Loki weighs about 28 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Loki. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Loki and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Shelter life is certainly hard on some dogs and Apple was definitely having a tough time adjusting to shelter life. She is definitely learning to trust and is getting better with our volunteers and in her foster home, but we are hoping to get her into a furever home where hopefully she will learn to trust even more with love and patience. \nA quieter home with no children would be recommended for her. Apple is ok with other dogs and cats or if a potential adopter has neither that would be great since she would get all of the attention.\nShe is approx 12 yrs and about 6lbs\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Apple email dogadoptions@thesanctuarypa.org \n\nWe are open every Saturday to the public  from 10-2 to meet our dogs. Dog adoptions will not take place during that 10-2 timeframe and applications will only be taken on our available dogs that day. \nAlso please do not bring your own dogs during our Saturday open hours.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: At this time we are following CDC guidelines and practicing social distancing and wearing masks in our buildings \n\nHope to see you soon!!",

She is a little more nervous around men than women and need some time to warm up to new people but once she does she is a total love who gives lots of kisses and loves belly rubs. She is housebroken, approx 6 yrs and about 95 lbs\nBrooklyn would do best as the only pet in the home where she can get all the attention, love and treats too of course! Older children 12 yrs + is preferred \nIf you are interested in adopting please email dogadoptions@thesanctuarypa.org to fill out an application and questionnaire \n\nWe are open every Saturday to the public from 10 - 2 to meet our dogs. \nDog adoptions will not take place during that 10 - 2 timeframe and applications will only be taken on our available dogs that day. Also please do not bring your own dogs during our Saturday open hours.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: At this time we are following CDC guidelines and practicing social distancing and wearing masks in our buildings \n\nHope to see you soon!!",

He was rescued from difficult conditions where was not being well cared for on the property of a man breeding hounds.  He deserves a better life with a family to love and care him.  Scooby is friendly and sweet.  He loves treats and takes them very gently.  He enjoys going for walks and being outdoors where he can use his hound nose! \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our Dog Adoption Counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!",

            "description": "Hi there my name is Louie and I'm a 10-month pitbull mix. I'm from Franklin County Animal Shelter and am at HALO though the Shelter & Rescue Partner Program. The shelter thought I would be a good candidate for this program because when I was surrendered to the shelter, I was very fearful and showing fear agression (growling at the shelter staff). At HALO, I learned that people are not scary and are actually very nice. I also have many, many dog friends who have helped me overcome my fear of people. I am currenlty working on: walkling nicely on a leash (I am still afraid of bikes), respecting items in my room (I still chew on things I shouldn't), and greeting people properly (sometimes I bark at them). Even though I am a work in progress, I am the sweetest boy with the cutest personality. I would do best in a home with someone who has another confident, well adjusted dog who can teach me how to overcome my issues. I've only been at HALO since August and have made amazing strides. The people at HALO are confident that I will be a perfect companion given the chance. Love, Lou-Lou \n\nWe are a foster based organization and DO NOT have our adoptable pets at HALO. You must complete an adoption application to meet the cat or dog. We are by appointment ONLY. If you are interested in adopting Louie, please submit your application www.halok9behavior.com/forms or Franklin County Animal Shelter at dogs.franklincountyohio.gov/services/adoption",

I like to do my own thing around the yard and get all the sniffs, although I will always say yes to a treat! My last family couldn't keep me because I did not do well with their livestock- apparently cows and chickens don't like being chased. I will be my happiest as the only pet in your life, and because I am so large I would do best with older kids only (16+). Call SPCA Florida to meet me today!",

If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

He loves to go from walks and rides. But he also has some special needs. He is very protective of his environment. He needs a home that has little to no visitors or put into a quite space when people come to visit. He would do better with a privacy fence and someone he can snuggle with. His adoption fee is $135. Please visit our website to complete an adoption application www.noahshopeanimalrescue.com/adopt/apply\n\nPlease note: Captain is in a foster home and is available to meet by appointment only with an approved adoption application.

            "description": "Nash is a special 'rescue only' dog who has bite experiences. He will not be available until we have been able to work with him and feel comfortable in him meeting experienced adults. This posting is FYI only - He is 3 years young and 55 lbs.\nNO APPOINTMENTS at this time. Applications only from adults experienced with big dog training. NO APPOINTMENTS at this time. No children, no cats, no other dogs. He did get along well with Marverick here, who was 20 pounds bigger than Nash.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

My name\u2019s Dorothy, and I\u2019m a beautiful American Staffordshire Terrier who is available for adoption through Fetching Tails Foundation. In general, I\u2019m pretty laid back and like to keep my energy levels low. I'm a big cuddler and tend to go with the flow, but I do make exceptions for some Olympic-style backyard zoomies and high-octane play sessions with my toys. This excitement can carry over into first introductions with other dogs. It takes me a few minutes to chill, but I will eventually get there. While I\u2019m working on making better first impressions with other four-legged friends, I think that I would be happy with another submissive canine pal or in an only-dog household. Though, it\u2019d be best that my forever home be feline-free because I can\u2019t imagine cats would have time for my silly antics. With that said, I get along very well with every human that I meet. I love snuggling and spending time with my people!\n\nI\u2019ve accomplished so much already - including crate and potty training - and I contentedly sleep in my crate when left alone for anywhere between 3-8 hours at a time. Being the strong girl that I am, I could use some more practice with my leash manners. I\u2019m incredibly smart, so it\u2019s nothing a little training and patience couldn\u2019t help! Someone once said that there\u2019s no place like home, and I cannot wait to experience that feeling for myself. If I had a pair of ruby slippers, I\u2019d click my paws together right now and wish to find my forever home today!\u00a0\n\nCheers,\nDorothy\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through.

My name is Dante and I'm on the search for a comfy couch and fun-loving family! I am the kind of dude who will match the energy of my family: my favorite activity in the world is lounging on the couch, but a close second is playing outside. If you want to relax all day with some Netflix, let's do it! If you wanna romp around and run zoomies in our yard, I am all about that life! When I want to play, I can be quite boisterous so I would do best in a home without young children; teenagers who can handle my size and energy would be fine. I should be your only pet for now (no other dogs or cats, please!) I like other dogs but I get overexcited and my enthusiasm turns off a lot of potential friends, so until I learn better manners and work on my introductions I would do better as the only dog in my home. I also need a fenced yard (tall fences that are at least 5 feet, please!) so I can run zoomies and play fetch before we curl up on the couch again to catch some zzzz's.\n\nI am a very smart guy, and generally well behaved around the home. I am potty and crate trained: I actually love my crate and think of it as my personal man cave where I can enjoy some quiet time chewing on durable toys and kongs. Everyone is a work in progress, however, and I would appreciate a family with previous strong-dog experience who will work with me on my leash manners. I get SO excited when I see new people or dogs and can pull hard to greet them. I would do best in a quiet suburban neighborhood where there are not many distractions on walks, and my humans need to commit to training classes so I can work on not pulling so hard on the leash when I want to try and meet new potential friends. I already know a few basic commands such as sit and wait, and I really enjoy learning so I think training classes could be the first of many fun adventures! I am a big, goofy guy who doesn't realize just how big I am, but big dogs have big hearts filled with lots of love, am I right? I hope you fill out an adoption application soon so I can show you how affectionate I can be!\n\nLove,\nDante\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through.

Their destiny is leaving for their forever home as a bonded pair. These two start playing the minute their eyes open in the morning and they will continue until bedtime if allowed. These two love to do\nalmost\neverything together including galloping in and out side-by-side for potty breaks, patrolling the property, and digging holes in the yard. Barbie is a hilarious goof ball and very expressive! She is coming up on her 1-year birthday in January. She has an assertive play-style that includes lots of growly noises but it's all good natured. Barbie has a strong Pyr paw and runs like a rocket, so would not do well in a house with small children. Typical of most female Pyrs Barbie is independent and strong-willed (and typical of some teens, a little demanding) so she will need Pyrents who are strong and fair leaders and willing to work with her and provide consistent boundaries. Barbie has a jaw deformity due to possible trauma or birth deformity but she has no problems drinking and eating. Barbie continues to learn it's okay to ride in the car and is crated trained although not a big fan. Barbie does NOT like sharing food or treats with Muffy so they need to be separated while eating. Barbie is still learning there is plenty of water for everyone so may need to be redirected while Muffy is drinking. Barbie is currently being fostered in Tacoma, WA.\n\nOUR REQUIREMENTS FOR PUPPY ADOPTION:\n\n1) PUPPIES WILL ONLY BE PLACED IN HOMES THAT HAVE AT LEAST ONE MEDIUM TO LARGE YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOG that is age 1 or older. This helps integrate the dog into your household easier by giving the pup a mentor.\n\n2) These puppies are not livestock dogs. They must be family pets that are allowed inside the home.\n\n3) In addition to the youthful playful dog, someone must also be home at least part of the day. Please do not apply for a puppy if you are gone 8+ hours a day.\n\n4) We give preference to applicants with prior Great Pyrenees knowledge/experience.\n\n5) Secure and visible fencing required.\n\n6) You must have a plan in place to socialize your puppy properly.\n\n7) Please do NOT write us and ask if this puppy is available. If it is posted, it is available. However, we may be working other applications that came in before yours. If so, by the time you are approved, the puppy may not be available.\n\nAdoption Fee: $425\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nTransport Fee: $300\n\nTransport fee includes the cost of transport plus the Health Certificate required for USDA approved transport.\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.greatpyrsandpaws.org\n\nhttps://greatpyrsandpaws.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5959\n\nNorthwest adopter pays cost of transport to independent transport company. Transport is arranged by GPPR.",

It will take a patient and kind adopter to take the time to work with her for Kimmi to fully blossom. She loves treats but doesn't like to be touched.\n\nShe is great with dogs and cats and lives with both in her foster home. She is crate and house trained. She would do best with a fenced in yard.\n\nKimmi is about one year old and loves to nap on the couch or in her crate! She would benefit in a home with another dog to learn from.\n\nTo adopt, please fill out an adoption application at https://www.threepawsrescue.org/adoption-application/\n\nFor information about adoption fee, please visit https://www.threepawsrescue.org/adoption-fees/\n\nTo learn about the adoption process, please visit https://www.threepawsrescue.org/adoption-process/\n",

This boy loves nothing more than to front load into your lap for snuggle time. Like a crane operator, he will carefully pick out treats from your hand, puzzles games or a snuffle mat. And even a flatbed truck full of toys or bones is not enough for this guy as he is happy to sample any toys or bones that are on the lot. Tonka will demolish dirt piles that make a monster truck look like child's play and rev himself up for a good round of wrestling with other pups.\n\nTonka has previously tested positive for Heartworm (which is not contagious to other canines) and has completed his treatment. He has been hovering around the home, like a helicopter, with minimal exercise, so he will need to slowly ramp up activity. The Rescue Crew will paint the lines to guide you to success by providing a mentor and vetting coordinator to assist you through his transition.\n\nTonka does well with other dogs in the home. Another dog in the home would help grade the way and provide some confidence. However, he would also do just fine paving the route himself into the home as an only animal. Tonka has not yet been around cats or children, so we are unsure how that team would work out.\n\nTonka is a sweet and gentle boy, built like a Tonka truck but with a heart that will pave the way for him to be a breed ambassador for Pitties everywhere. Tonka's life may be under construction, but he can't wait for the day when his forever family is unveiled to him.\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

For an application please see our website www.tanyasinc.org and download an application and e-mail it to us. All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, dewormed, and are treated with advantix for fleas and ticks. They are also micro chipped(transfer of registration to your name is $20.00). With every adoption you will also receive coupons from PETCO.The best way to get ahold of us is to e-mail Tanya at tanyasinc@msn.com",

            "description": "Lollipop is approximately 2 years (Born December 2018).  He\u2019s in great health. Guessing weight at about 15 to 20 pounds. He is a great little dog once accustomed to his environment. He  gets along fine with other dogs, but because if his lineage would not recommend a home with small children.\n\nLollipop Blue is a border collie mix (potentially chihuahua father) with a big heart and playful demeanor. As he has not been socialized, he will be shy with new people and may take a little time to warm up, especially if there are multiple people around. Despite this, he is very gentle and loves to be held. Luckily he\u2019s small enough to sit in your lap or cuddle on the couch while you pet his head and scratch behind his ears. Because he has spent a lot of time outside, he is not yet potty trained but he is doing well in a crate and can hold his bladder until it\u2019s time for a break. Blue has displayed some separation anxiety tendencies and likes to stay close to his people to feel safe. Otherwise, he is content to lay in his bed or in a soft place near you while you work. While new to playing fetch with others, he loves to amuse himself with a soft toy that he can flip up and throw around. He is nervous with new sounds so a quiet home would be ideal, although he loves other dogs and would not mind sharing with some more friends. Because of his breed, he has light herding tendencies but quickly corrects and understands \u201cNo\u201d. For this reason he may not be good in a home with young kids. Just like he enjoys quiet, Blue is also very quiet and does not bark or cry. He has a medium-low activity level and does good with a few short walks each day, but has sturdy legs and energy for more if you\u2019re up to it. He is good to match your energy level and happy to lay around so long as he can check in on you and have a quiet place to relax. When he wants attention he will come up to your side and might gently place his paws on you, but is good about not jumping and understands \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cDown\u201d. If you don\u2019t have time to play, he will either lay down or play with his toys on his own. He is the perfect work-from-home buddy. We\u2019re still working on other basics like \u201cSit\u201d and \u201cStay\u201d, but he\u2019s smart and will quickly pick up a routine and training. \n\n",

She was found tied up to a bridge, skin & bones, and appears to have been spending her entire life like this, as her rescuers had to talk the man holding her under the bridge, into giving her up.  She is approx 1 year old\n\nMia is Deaf, so she will need a special someone to take her in, and work with her.  She is not doing well in our current crazy rescue environment, as she can't keep up with all the Chaos.  She is a very sweet dog with people, tolerant of some younger dogs, but really needs someone to be one-on-one with her.  A controlled environment is a MUST for her, and having someone she can trust is another.  She will need full training, as we just got her in.  Adoption fee is negotiable, as we do know training is needed, and we can help find a trainer if needed.\n\nMia is an active dog. We have been working on lead training her, but without verbal direction, it takes more time than our short staffed rescue can handle right now.  We are hoping that this one special person(s) is out that there that can handle this little girl and get her on the right track.  Are you that one special person?",

The woman reached out to us and we were able to get him neutered and up to date on his vaccinations. Javi has spent a lot of time outside. He LOVES people and spent time with a young child where he was giving them kisses. We have not been able to observe him for long periods of time with children, so we can't say for certain how he would act. While at the foster's house there was a scuffle with her little dog which ended with that dog having a swollen lip. We are not certain the details of the scuffle and do not know if Javi was the aggressor or not. Due to this incident, we are recommending a home with no dogs and no cats. Javi is currently in boarding and the staff comment often how sweet he is. We would love to find him a home who can be patient and provide him the love he deserves. \n Javi is in a foster home in the Kent, WA area. He LOVES people and would love to find his forever home. \n\nPlease fill out an application \nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

I am looking for my home that will enable my final transformation into a couch potato. As a ten year old Golden Girl, I identify closely with Rose, as I always want pets and love. I will care about my forever family with my whole heart! When I'm not sleeping around or asking for pets, I like to play in water outside, or go for walks around the block! I am a simple pup and would do well in a low traffic home that enjoys my lazy nature. I do well with other dogs that can understand dog behavior and know just to leave me alone (although sometimes I do try and play) and patient kitties. I would ask that my forever family understand that I like to express what is on my mind a lot. From grunts, groans, to barks, I have a lot to say! I can't wait to meet you!\n\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"\"http://www.austingermanshepherdrescue.org\"\">Austin German Shepherd Rescue</a> for more information on this pet!</p>",

His little frickled face is just precious. \n\nTuckers story is one of survival. He was born in a junkyard with his three sisters. They lived 15 feet from a very busy road. I feared that we would be to late to save them all. Tucker was the first one that I was able to bring to rescue. He was petrified!  Thankfully he was smittened by a female foster and he went wherever she did. He has come such a long way and becoming more trusting everyday.\n\nIf you're a fan of hound mixes,this is your boy.

He is an approximately 3 year old, labrador/hound mix. Pablo is very loving, affectionate, and social. He loves romping around in the backyard with his brother, Pedro. Pablo is seeking an active family as he loves to explore!  Pablo is an energetic pup with a great sense of adventure.  Pablo may do best in a family with older children, as he doesn\u2019t realize how big he is in size.\n\nPedro and Pablo are litter mates and have spent their entire life together, literally. Although STARS would love for them to be housed together, they are not a bonded pair. This pair was surrendered by their previous owner to local animal control. Willene, founder of STARS was contacted by animal control and these brothers were taken in to safety. Now, STARS is hoping to find them their furever homes.\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.\n",

Pedro is an approximately 3 year old, labrador/hound mix. He is very social, loving, and affectionate. He is in search of an active family who can help expend some of his energy and sense of adventure. Pedro may be best in a family with bigger children, as he doesn\u2019t remember his own strength.\n\nPedro and Pablo are litter mates and have spent their entire life together, literally. Although STARS would love for them to be housed together, they are not a bonded pair. This pair was surrendered by their previous owner to local animal control. Willene, founder of STARS was contacted by animal control and these brothers were taken in to safety. Now, STARS is hoping to find them their furever homes.\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.\n",

He has an adorable personality.  He gets along with the 9 dogs at his foster home, but does try to hog attention.  He so wants to be the center of someone\u2019s universe!

I am a big time snuggler. My preference is to cuddle with a human, but a stuffed toy is a good substitute when needed. I do like to be the center of attention, but who can blame me? I just love playing and interacting with my people.\n\nOf course, in addition to enjoying the company of humans, I adore the companionship of other canines. I will do best in a home with a submissive sibling. If you don't already have one in your family, may I suggest Kooter? He and I are already very good friends.\n\nIf you adopt me, you will be getting some perks. For example, I am already house trained, which I know you like. I also respond to the commands \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\" If I do something of which my foster parents do not approve, they will use a stern voice to let me know. When that happens, I respond very well because I want to always make my humans happy.\n\nDo you drive? I hope so because I just love going for car rides. I sit nicely clipped in the back seat and take in all the sights and smells. Of course, I am equally as happy spending most of my days lounging around or playing.\n\nAt night, when I curl up in bed with my foster family, I dream of finding a family of my very own. I know my furever home is out there. I sure do hope we find each other soon. Just think, we can keep each other warm as the cooler weather moves in. What a cozy winter we will have together.\n\n\n\n------\n\nB.O.N.E.S. is a foster-home-based rescue organization serving dogs and potential adopters in the New England states.

Are you my new family? That would be amazing.\n\nLet me tell you a bit about myself. I am a very good boy who is already house trained. I know that makes you happy. In addition, I know the commands \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\" Pretty good, wouldn't you say?\n\nI absolutely LOVE my people. I really, really prefer to be with humans whenever I can, so my hope is that there will be a family member home more often than not. As a matter of fact, I even sleep in bed with my human family. Nothing beats cuddling with them. Sometimes we go for car rides. I love to go on road trips. Of course, if the car stops for too long, I bark: \"let's go, let's go, I want to move!\" Walking on my leash is also something I enjoy doing with my foster parents. I walk very nicely so that humans and canines all have a pleasant time.\n\nWhen the sun is shining, you will most likely find me sun bathing. Ahhh, what a wonderful, warm feeling. Would you mind handing me the suntan lotion?\n\nI will do best in a home with another dog since I do value canine companionship. If you do not already have one, may I suggest Jake? He's my very good buddy.\n\nIf you are hoping to add a loving, snuggly, sun-worshiping, furry family member to your home, please consider adopting me. It would really be a dream come true to have a furever home. Looking forward to meeting you soon.\n\n\n------\n\nB.O.N.E.S. is a foster-home-based rescue organization serving dogs and potential adopters in the New England states. We do not have a shelter.

Our dogs are also heartworm negative (or we will cover their treatment). To start the process please visit our website and fill out the adoption application (www.dfwrescueme.org/adoption-application) and from there the foster family can answer any questions and arrange a time to meet.

I tried to escape and bite a few guards who wanted to keep me locked up.I need someone who will be patient with me. Someone who is quiet and gentle, but doesn't let me be the boss.

When I arrived in rescue I had a tumor the size of a peach on my stomach. After it was removed I still reacted when people touched my stomach. It's been a few years now and I am finally learning that humans can touch me without causing me pain.I weigh a nice 11 pounds. I love to carry toys around. I love to jump up on laps and be petted.I am often described as silly and sweet. Silly because I like to throw my toys in the air and catch them and sweet because I enjoy sitting on your lap.I walk very well on leash. I would prefer to be an only dog in a home with a mature woman.Are you the lady who I can bring a lot of happiness to? If so, apply to adopt me at www.atailttotell.com",

If youre looking for a dog you can carry around, a dog who will stare at you adoringly and a dog that will sleep with you, I am the girl for you. I am an absolute delight.

Queenie is able to use a dog door to go outside but if it is dark(early morning, late at night) she may not make it through the door. She has a hard time with depth perception. I leave pee pads by the dog door & she knows to use it if she can\u2019t make it out side.  Queenie loves to go on walks & sniff all the wonderful smells. She loves attention & when happy will rub her back on the floor. She is not a big barker unless others are barking. Queenie is a very gentle senior lady hoping to find the perfect companion to spend her retirement. Great on the leash, she enjoys long, quiet walks with ample time to smell the roses. Quick to learn the doggie door leads to sunbathing on the patio furniture, she sure is a creature of comfort.  \n Interested in adoption? you must have an approved application on file with us. You can find that application at www.austincockerrescue.org",

This senior girl is still active, loving her walks and car rides with our volunteers and enjoying pool time. She would do well with a fenced in yard and a family who will spend time playing with her. Maybe even a pool to have some swimming time? She's very affectionate and enjoys lots of petting when playtime is over. Meeka doesn't want to share her family with other pets so being the only four-legged member of the family is the ideal home for her. Meeka was raised with kids and would enjoy having children to play with again. She is 9 years old and weighs approximately 65 lbs. For an appointment to meet her, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070.",

I'm a very active, loud, athletic boy who must have plenty of mental and physical stimulation on a daily basis. I'm VERY nose driven, but if you ever lose your sandwich, I'M YOUR GUY! (honestly, I'm probably the reason you can't find it, but I'll help you search for it anyway)\n I'm looking for active people with plenty of time and patience to teach me how to be a good member of a new pack. I'd LOVE to have a medium/large furry friend who also loves to run all day, and I definitely need a 6 ft fence (anything shorter and I'm GONE) If you think I could make your family complete, CALL (757) 432-9222.",

Prior to coming to us he spent his life on a chain. Gunner has since been placed in a great foster home with children, cats, and other dogs. Gunner is housebroken and crate trained. He would do best with older kids (due to his lack of vision and hearing, he can be a bit intrusive to introduce himself to both people and pets). Gunner loves to be with people, and loves car rides. He loves to socialize with new people and has proven to be an amazing companion to his foster family. Even though he has limitations, he would be a special addition to any home. Due to his special needs, Gunner will require a secure fenced in yard. If interested in meeting or adopting Gunner, please complete an application on our website at www.tgspca.org",

Penny was on the list for euthanasia at a high kill shelter when her foster Mom stepped up to save her. Penny is a laid back gal who loves to smile and roll over for belly rubs. Her favorite past time is snoozing but shes always down for a good romp around the yard with her puppy friends. She is both dog and people friendly and has met several children and done well with them. She is being fostered with a 15 year old who she adores, loves to jump on and give her hugs. Penny is shy with men at first, but warmed up to her foster dad just fine over time. She enjoys walks, and would love someone who would like to walk with her. Penny is crate trained, being fostered at a house with a fenced yard where she is let out to go potty and up to date on all her vetting and spayed. She is a sweet soul who wants to be loved and give love. To apply to adopt -- www.charliescrusaders.org",

Currently fostered in Tacoma, WA. \n\nPlease read Brienne\u2019s whole bio!\n\nBrienne is about 3 years old. She weighs about 80-85 pounds and is a big, strong girl!\n\nThis girl loves to love her person! She will be a wonderful companion for a single person or couple, preferably female, who live a quiet, private lifestyle. Her ideal day would be roaming her yard, destuffing some toys, and then taking a long nap in the company of her favorite person. \n\nBrienne is dog reactive and stranger reactive. She has significant prey drive and is not well suited for a home where she would have access to or interactions with other animals. She finds strangers very stressful. She can manage viewing strangers from afar (Like on a walk) but a busy household with people coming in and out of the house would be difficult for her. \n\nHomes with other animals (dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, chickens, livestock, etc) will NOT be considered. Homes with children under 15 in the home or regularly visiting the home will NOT be considered. \n\nBrienne is muzzle trained, crate trained, and potty trained. Her leash skills are good but not perfect. The muzzle she uses will come home with her and we are happy to walk any adopters through the \u201chow and why\u201d of her muzzle. Her muzzle is an important tool to keep her and others safe while training her and expanding her world!\n\nBrienne loves her crate and is accustomed to sleeping, eating, and relaxing in there. We highly recommend any adopter continues this practice. \n\nBrienne would be well-suited to a home with a well-fenced, large yard. She loves to go out and patrol her yard, searching for excellent smells. \n\nShe is not a dog that would do well in dog parks or daycare. She thrives on a quiet, routine, homebody life!\n\nBrienne currently takes daily Prozac to help mitigate her stress and anxiety. She also uses CBD oil and composure treats as needed. These are all great tools for helping her feel more safe and confident. \n \nWe anticipate that Brienne\u2019s new family will set up several meet and greets with her before starting a slow transition into her new home. \n\nAdopters should be prepared to work with a vet, trainer, and/or behaviorist to give Brienne the opportunity to put her best paw forward!\n\nWe are so excited for Brienne to have a chance to be her best self!\n\nOur adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping and transport expenses. Adoption fee for Brienne is  $150 to help offset travel and medical expenses.\n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt",

            "description": "Meet Drake! Poor guy has had a rough life so far.\n\nHe was abandoned at the shelter by his first family. Shelter life took its toll on him and he would fight with the other dogs. We pulled him to keep him from being euthanized and found him a wonderful home! Sadly, he had to come back to foster care through no fault of his own.\n\nDrake is a lab/retriever mix, estimated at 6 years old or so, 55 lbs, neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm negative and on prevention.\n\nHe's very sweet and adores children! He's house and crate trained and loves hanging in the yard or house with his people.\nHe needs to be an only animal in a home.\nDon't let this handsome hunk get away! To adopt Drake, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

She has had no training which makes it hard for her to find a new home as she is a large strong dog. With the help of a strong volunteer, we took her for a leash walk. The first thing she did was give us kisses. She enjoyed being petted. She didn't know the first thing about walking on a leash, but is very treat oriented, and wants to please. She is sensitive, so gentle corrections work best for her. At the rescue, she barks a lot, but in reality, she is a sweet, affectionate, beautiful dog who would be easy to train, though some strength in her new owner would help to guide her.\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.\n\nOur application is on our front page of Petfinder, on the middle right hand side under our logo. Please send adoption applications to either pintler_petsmt@yahoo.com or pintlerpetsrose@gmail.com\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/mt/anaconda/pintlerpets-mt33/",

She is barely a year old and on the small side, only 34 lbs. She's a lab mix of sorts, but DNA tests are pending to find out what this beautiful girl is!\n\nMila was so scared, but despite all she's been through, still greeted us with sweet kisses. She is now in an amazing foster home, loves her humans, especially the kiddos as she is full puppy now and LOVES to play. Mila is quickly learning what it is to be LOVED and in a HOME.\n\nPlease consider bringing Mila into your home.",

That grey muzzle could tell stories but he'd much rather lay on your lap and hear yours!\n\nHe was picked up as a stray in a vacant lot and looks like he's been there a very long time since he had regular meals. He's so skinny and could really use some TLC and a soft comfy bed for his boney body!\n\nLeo is about 7-9 years old and weighs about 60lbs although he definitely needs to put on some pounds! He is super sweet, and a reserved boy but LOVES treats!\n\nVisit scoutshonor.org to fill out an application on Leo today!",

DOB 2-15-20), male, 35 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. We used this picture to post because this is Cedric right now. He is a broken soul that needs a very special home. He is shut down, scared to even move. He has shown some glimmers of progress but quickly resorts to hiding and being invisible.\n\nHe is a flight risk; he will try to flee if he thinks he can. This is Cedric. We know he will heal; but it will be on his own clock and in his own comfort zone. His very special home will have patience and empathy to let him just \"be\" until he is ready.\n\nHis ideal home will be knowledgeable about fearful dog and will work with our Team on how to help him. Also he will need another dog or dogs around that he can look to for observing trust with humans. We do not know what happened to this poor pup; we don't want to even imagine but we do know our Community will help him; because he is worth it. He has had some sort of emotional trauma. That's why we saved him! Stay tuned for more information as Cedric is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cedric please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Bridget is a 60 pound, smooshable, 2 year old American/English Bulldog and Pittie mix.  She is crate trained and has known nothing but love since she was a puppy and rescued by a good Samaritan. Bridget is  a little shy at first, but once she warms up all she craves is belly rubs and massages.  While she loves a good rodeo with bigger dogs, she\u2019s gentle enough to play with her small breed foster siblings. Bridget also loves a good nap and plenty of beauty sleep. She's very loving and ideally, she will do best with a single person or a couple without children or much traffic in and out of the home as unfamiliar people are a little scary to her.",

He's a gentle giant with a sensitive soul and he would love to shake your hand. When he came to the shelter he was very shy at first, but with time he has opened up and showed us his playful side. He loves catching treats mid-air and romping around when excited. His sweet gaze will melt your heart. We don't know exactly how old Maltby is as he came to us as a stray but we think around three years old. \n\n\n\nHe would prefer to be the only dog in the house. He can get spooked by sudden movements or loud noises, so we think a home with adults only or older children would be best. His ideal environment would be a house with a large fully fenced yard on a quiet neighborhood street with little to no foot traffic. A busy apartment complex contains too many surprises and other furry friends!\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at sasfosterdogs@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!",

After losing her previous owner, she wound up at a San Francisco animal shelter where she found herself at risk of being euthanized. Luckily, she had amazing shelter volunteers and staff in her corner who advocated for her and matched her up with SacRDR.\n\nRoxci is a Chihuahua/Pit Bull mix, and definitely has the chihuahua attitude. She is a petite 35 pounds but has personality overflowing! She can be quite vocal and will tell you exactly how she feels - this girl has no qualms about airing any grievances and making her opinions known! All in all she prefers to be treated like a princess and spoiled rotten. Roxci is currently undergoing training, and her adoption fee will cover initial training sessions up as well to set her future family up for success.\n\nIf you're interested in applying to adopt, please complete an application at www.sacrdr.org/adopt.\nTo keep up with Roxci, check out #SacRDRRoxci on Facebook and Instagram!",

            "description": "NOTE: During the 2020-21 winter holidays, we are updating our webpage and moving the profiles of adoptable Pyrs to www.carolinapyrrescue.com. Esme is typical of the kind of wonderful dog we have available! We always have 15-20 Pyrs looking for furever homes, and we welcome those interested in adopting a Pyr to read our policies and fill out an application at carolinapyrrescue.com. This application is generic and to come meet the Pyrs. Those who find their match can fill out the adoption contract once they meet the right dog. We will have updated profiles featured under the OUR PYRS tab at carolinapyrrescue.com, but as our volunteers rebuild our webpage, other volunteers are continuing to place dogs, and welcome those who want to adopt to fill out an application. The miracle of rescue is that the right dog is at the rescue for the right people at the right time!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEsme, short for Esmerelda, came to us as an owner surrender.  \n\nShe is three years old.\n\nEsme is spayed and fully vaccinated. She is heart worm negative.\n\nWe truly wish Esme wasn\u2019t in rescue. Her owner reached out to us early in 2020 when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She passed with her beloved dogs, and then friends of her and volunteers got Esme and her siblings, Solomon and Oliver, to rescue. Some folks think rescue dogs always come to us with histories of abuse or neglect. Esme was very, very loved by his first owner and her family and friends.  \n\nWe know all about Esme\u2019s Pyrsonality. She is a confident and social female Pyr who help her brothers in line. She is social with humans large and small and affectionate. \n\nEsme is also playful and would enjoy sharing a home with a playful male dog her size or smaller dogs of either sex. She can be adopted with Solomon if folks are looking for a bonded pair. She can\u2019t share a home with another female dog her size. \n\nShe could join a home with children, but for now she is best matched with older children only because she jumps. We are working on that. She could go to experienced dog owners who have small children if they understand how to correct that behavior and commit to working on it. She loved the little ones who helped care for her first owner at the end of her life, but she's still learning how to keep all \"four on the floor\" when she's excited. \n\nWe don\u2019t know if she is tolerant of cats. We don\u2019t have cats at the rescue and can\u2019t test her.\n\nLike all Pyrs, Esme needs a solid and securely fenced yard. \n\nThose interested in adopting a Pyr should read our policies and fill out an application to meet the Pyrs at carolinapyrrescue.com.\n",

            "description": "Meet Lisa! A blue and white beautiful pitbull looking for her furever home. She originally had a rough start to life and was extremely emaciated to where every bone could be seen, since he has learned all the good things people have to offer. Lisa is a\nextremely smart lady as she has learned \"sit,\" \"stay,\" \"break\" (from the stay), and \"drop it\" (which includes off-limits objects as well as dropping the toy during fetch). Lisa LOVES a fun, energy filled game of fetch. Even when playing in the dark, Lisa will sniff around methodically until she finds the object if she loses sight of where it was thrown. She would be a great candidate for someone interested in doing nose work with their furry companion. At the age of 3 years Lisa has already mastered crate and house training. Though Lisa does have basic training she would benefit from having a experienced owner who can continue working on her training as she does become nervous of new people, though has been overcoming this\nmarvelously\nwith structure and routine. A family with teens-and-up and no small dogs would be a great match for Lisa. During her down time Lisa enjoys lounging on the couch or the bed and snuggling up with her human. She also LOVES chew toys. Lisa is just a wonderful dog and will be a fun addition to her new home! Send in your adoption application today;\nhttps://www.underhoundrailroad.org/adoption/\n\nLisa is currently being fostered in South Carolina, please reach out to us for when she is expected to travel to Maine.",

He is very easy going and chill with a happy and loving personality! He loves chasing balls in the yard and going for walks (he will need a little training on not pulling while leash walking), car rides, doggy play groups, and enjoys doing some agility work as well! Although he was found as a stray it's clear that this boy grew up in a home! He loves treats so training sessions are favorite. Jericho will do best with a patient, dog savvy adopter who is willing to learn the best ways to communicate with this handsome boy, plus the guidance and help from Canine Company who is donating (3) eManners/Obedience training sessions to his adopter.. Call the shelter to make an appointment to meet him!  \n\n\nJericho is up to date on vaccinations, is micro-chipped, and is Neutered. \nAdoption fee: Jericho's adoption fee has been paid for by a ROAR friend!!\nCanine Company is donating (3) eManners/ Obedience training sessions to his adopter. \n\n\n**For more information regarding ROAR\u2019s adoption policies and procedures, please visit our website at roar-ridgefield.org and select the \u2018adopt\u2019 tab on the home page.

He has made great improvements in his foster home in the last couple months and we feel he is ready to join a permanent family if you have experience and the patience and desire to work with a breeder released dog (with trust issues ).  He will require a home with another playful dog ( sheltie preferably), sufficient time at home during the day ( not a long day of crating). We will not be placing him in a home with children and will only choose an age appropriate adopter (he is only one year of age ).  A SECURELY FENCED YARD IS MANDATORY.  He loves to run like the wind when he plays outdoors.  He has also begun to be a couch/recliner snoozer which has helped with his human bonding process. \n\nBEFORE INQUIRING ABOUT ADOPTING ONE OF OUR AVAILABLE PETS or TAKING THE TIME TO FILL OUT OUR QUITE DETAILED APPLICATION, PLEASE REVIEW THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON OUR ADOPTION INFO  LINK TO ENSURE THAT YOU WILL MEET THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT ONE OF OUR PETS.

Will you be my new best friend? Take me home today!\" Sadly, Roxbury's owner died and Roxbury lost the only home he had known. We're certain that Furkids can find him as good a home as he was accustomed to and he'll adjust quickly to his new person or family. Roxbury weighs 70 lbs., his estimated birth date is 2/3/2019 and his adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Roxbury, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog.

            "description": "*Currently on hold, pending *\nSarge is an American Bully male, slightly over one year in age.  He does have some issues that I will go into detail on......\nHe nips and controls the female in his home, his male adopter was a cop and doesn't put up with that so he mostly limits his \"corrections\" to \"his\" female. While working with him, he was submissive with me although he would sneak in a few nips. When I approach him to correct, he would submit but this guy does have a very strong personality and it is not only with his attempts to control his new owner of a few months, but also with his loyalty. He will \"correct\" his owners with barks and nips if ignored, if she does not play tug with him he will hit her with his tug toy. He will bark at her if she refuses to turn on the TV for him. I asked that I enter the backyard alone when I arrived where he was and he greeted a stranger with wags. He is very calm and well behaved in the house.\n\nNow for his good traits...\nHe will sit for hours and watch Paw Patrol....no, really. He goes in his crate when asked. He rides like a human, sitting straight up in his seat and waits patiently while his female owner runs daily errands, enters business's and returns. He is well behaved to strangers. When I went over, he sat and waited for me to invite him into the house before entering when told, I also taught him to \"bring it and drop\" in a matter of minutes. He greets dogs on leash while hiking overly eager which does intimidate most dogs and their humans. **He should be an only dog until his control issues are controlled**. He still, did not like being corrected, clearly, but showed a 80 percent improvement after a few hours. He never bit me in an aggressive manner however Sarge is a large boy and will be placed as carefully.\nSarge is fully vetted, heart worm tested, all shots of course now neutered and micro chipped. He had a spider bite on his back which was infected and I had that treated, it is healed but does have scarring until his hair grows back and he comes with his doggy seat, and extra large crate. He is fully house broken. He is well above average intelligence, learns very quickly (within minutes) and is so loving, constantly wanting to be with his person and laying on my and their laps, with a personality so adorable that he can and will work his person into putty in his paws. I easily am able to take treats and toys away, he has no food aggression. I am able to pull on his teeth, toes, tail, put my face to his when eating.  \nSarge needs an adopter with time and training skills who can show him patience as well as guidance and be an only dog until his nipping is under control.  Will send in depth video to potentials.",

He was found early in the morning by a good samaritan who brought him home and called animal control to pick him up. \n\nIt was clear that Charlie had not been properly cared for as he was flea infested, underweight and missing hair on his back and ears from flea-related dermatitis. \n\nWe rescued Charlie from the shelter and brought him to our veterinarian for a full evaluation including a blood panel and urinalysis and he was found to be in good health with the exception of a heart murmur.  Charlie was evaluated by a cardiologist and has heart disease requiring daily medication.  He currently has no symptoms. Charlie had a recent dental cleaning and is up-to-date on all his vaccines.\n\nHe is an extremely sweet, gentle boy who loves everyone he meets.  Charlie LOVES other dogs, going on long walks and meeting new friends.  Charlie now has a gorgeous red, shiny coat and he doesn't shed!  \n\nHe is well mannered and completely house trained.  We would love for Charlie to have another doggy companion to hang out with.  Charlie is quite the ladies man!\n\nIf you are interested in Charlie, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.

When I was first found I was absolutely terrified of people; but, after several months in my patient and loving foster home I am starting to trust them and come out of my shy shell (I really like my foster mom and will even ask for pets now).   Dogs are a whole 'nother story.  I love to play with other dogs! Other dogs give me the confidence I need to be around people so a home with at least one other dog is an absolute MUST for me.  I am crate-trained, house-broken and doing really well with my leash training.  My vaccinations are all up-to-date and I am neutered.  If you have experience with extremely shy dogs, have another confident dog in your home and are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

            "description": "***Fence required***\n\nMeet Joey. \n\nJoey is a sweet, affectionate, beautiful 10 month old great Dane who came into the rescue a couple of months ago after his owners surrendered him to us because he could not control his bowels. Joey was pooping incessantly and very sick, and they could not afford to take him to a vet.\n\nWhen we got him into the rescue, he was skeletal and he had been dealing with incontinence for five months without treatment - according to the owners. \n\nWe got him straight to our vet where fecal tests revealed that he had one of the worst cases of hookworms that our vet has ever seen. In addition to that, ultrasound and xrays showed the hookworms had seriously damaged his intestinal tract and lining - causing him to have a chronic case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \n\nJoey went through several rounds of dewormer and antibiotics. Unfortunately, the hookworms did permanent damage to his stomach, so it is likely that Joey will always deal with IBD for the rest of his life. \n\nJoey requires a strict special diet, he can only have a specific sensitive-stomach food, and he takes a daily regimen of meds that he will also likely need to remain on for life. Even on all these meds though, he still has accidents at times. He has made huge improvements though since we\u2019ve gotten him. His stools have firmed up a lot and he\u2019s actually absorbing his food now, because he is no longer skin and bones. He also tries his best to make it outside to go potty.\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: Joey is one of the sweetest Danes you\u2019ll ever meet. And he is SO VERY GOOD with other dogs. And kids. And adults. All of them. He doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in him. He\u2019s very playful and submissive. He\u2019s still a goofy puppy too and he has no idea he\u2019s any different. All he wants to do is play. He lives to play with others. \n\nJoey is going to need someone who is home a lot and has the PATIENCE of a saint. One that won\u2019t fault him for something that is completely out of his control. He can\u2019t always control his poop. That\u2019s not likely to change. \n\nJoey will need someone whose house preferably isn\u2019t covered in rugs or carpet, is easily cleanable. Frequent outdoor trips for potty break will be necessary. He also absolutely needs to have another dane or large breed dog to be his playmate and companion. He does deal with separation anxiety and is a magician at breaking out of a crate to be able to hang with the other dogs. If left out with them, he\u2019s not destructive. He just wants to be near his family. But if you try to separate him from the others when gone, you may come home to a destroyed bathroom or crate (trust us). He DOES NOT like being separated. He is currently boarding with another Dane and does well.\n\nWe have not had Joey around any cats but we do not believe that he would ever be aggressive with them. He doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in him, he may just try to play with them. \n\nHe\u2019s lived with young kids and been great.\n\nJoey has a heart of gold. He just has specific special needs and will need a special person or family that can meet those needs. If you can, we promise you, he\u2019s a gem. Could you be that person? \n\nJoey\u2019s adoption fee is $400. To apply to adopt Joey please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt. \n\nATTENTION: If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

Smokey LOVES to be around other dogs and gets a lot of her confidence from them, so other well-adjusted dogs in the home that can show her the ropes is a must. She's great with kids and even tolerates her kitty-housemates well. Smokey can be a little shy at first, but this girl wants nothing more than affection and to be part of the \"pack\". She is kennel and house trained, UTD on vaccinations, spayed and has almost mastered this \u201cleash walking\u201d thing. Smokey is HW positive and has started treatment. AJL will continue to cover the cost of that treatment even after adoption.",

He just completed heartworm treatment which means he will be on activity restriction for just a couple more weeks.\n\nNephi's social circle is small and will always need to be so. Like many shy dogs, he needs careful and managed introductions to new people. He will do best in a low-traffic, adult-only home with at least one confident dog to continue to show him the ropes.\n\n3 y/o, 65 pounds, B U D D Y \nDogs: friendly\nCats: unknown\nKids: adult-only home",

            "description": "Meet Molly.  Molly is fostered in Rhode Island.  We were asked to take Molly in when her owner was very ill. Sadly her owner died just hours later.  Molly is approximately 7 years old.  While Molly has been fine with other dogs outside of her foster home she would prefer to be the only resident dog as that is all she\u2019s ever known.   Molly knows \u201ccome\u201d, \u201csit\u201d and \u201cpaw\u201d. She loves to go for walks and hang out in the yard. Molly has been very therapeutic for a volunteer who suffered the loss of a family member recently.  Maybe she understands what she\u2019s going through as she lost her one and only family member.  She\u2019d love to find a forever home where she doesn\u2019t have to worry about being alone again - we are looking for a home without young children for Molly.   She must have a fenced in yard-no electric fences.  She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and housebroken.. If interested in Molly please apply at Americanlabrescue.com.",

An appointment is not required. \n\nIf an adopter wishes to bring a current pet for a meet/greet, please send vet records showing the pet is UTD on all vaccines prior to your visit to blackdogclub@outlook.com\n\nThe adoption fee includes spay or neuter, microchip, age-appropriate vaccines, rabies vaccine, fecal test, deworming, and heartworm test. Dogs are treated if heartworm positive. All dogs are UTD on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. All dogs are health screened and vaccinated by our vet, Family Pet Animal Hospital or Quality Care Animal Hospital.\n\nWe do not know if our dogs are house trained. They are crated overnight. \n\nSam is a big lover with all humans. He came in with Dean. There were found as strays, turned over to Harnett Shelter and we pulled from there. We initially felt they were a bonded pair but have discovered they do great separated. Sam is learning basic manners and is working on leash training. Sam does have a high prey drive and would need to be an only pet. He enjoys playing with toys and chasing a ball. He would make a great pet for an older child. Estimated DOB: 10/09/2019. Current weight: approximately 80 lbs.",

            "description": "Muffin is a beautiful young pup with one floppy ear to give him some character. Muffin doesn't get caught up on his looks. Muffin's got things to do, he's a spicy pineapple. You see, Muffin's one of those dogs that wants to play ALL OF THE TIME! He's so very excited to meet other playmates, and if there are other dogs around, he's gonna to convince them that they want to play with him! Muffin is a survivor, having beat distemper, because of this he sometimes learns a bit differently. He has mastered sit and his foster mom is working on unique ways to teach him things. When you think about the definition of a 'normal dog', that may not be Muffin, but he is normal and perfect to us. Muffin has a lot of energy in all directions at once, and while he may not exactly have object-permanence down, he's an expert in playtime and looks for fun around every corner. Muffin's favorite toys can best be described as 'anything moving'. He will do zoomies with the resident dog in his foster home or on his own, he enjoys tug of war with stuffed animals and playing 'mouth' with his doggie friends. Hold onto those hollowed-out plush toys, because Muffin likes to throw them in the air and catch them. When Muffin finds a favorite plushie, he enjoys cuddling with it and occasionally grooming it. He also loves going on walks, is pretty good on leash and likes to stop a lot to look at stuff, especially if he can't figure out what it is. He's very alert to any weird sounds - if it's moving he should probably go try to play with it! When Muffin does stop moving, that means it's naptime, and he likes to lay on his human for that. He enjoys a good cuddle, but prefers sleeping separate and eats and sleeps overnight in his crate. He likes to kiss feet and hands very gently. He was particularly fond of his foster's mother and loved to melt into her whenever they would interact. As much as he loves people, Muffin often has a difficult time focusing, as he's constantly distracted by the next bit of fun he can see and sometimes seems to be ignoring potential adopters. But out on walks, he introduces himself to everyone he walks past and has an interest in runners (he'd likely make a nice jogging buddy). Overall, Muffin's entire mission in life is playing and finding ways to amuse himself. He also makes adorable 'gremlin noises'. Muffin is looking for an adopter that will understand that he has unique behavior quirks and medical challenges but everything is very manageable and APA is here to help! The ideal home for Muffin would have active people, a playful canine buddy to help burn off his energy, a yard to bound through and an unlimited supply of plushies and balls. If you're ready to be Muffin's forever playmate, come meet this great pup!",

            "description": "This is Harvey!  He's a young male adult, on the large side.  We think he might be an Akita mix.  He is handsome and playful!  Harvey can be fearful of new situations and can be unpredictable in his reactions, so he would do best  with an experienced owner.  We think that as he is exposed to more situations, he'll settle in nicely, but his new family will need to be watchful and patient.  New situations have caused him to nip, he is especially touchy with his neck area.  We are not recommending him for a home with young children.  Harvey can be very loving and is pretty good about entertaining himself in his kennel with some toys!  He hasn't quite grasped the concept of \"fetch\" but he does love to chase a ball!  He really seems to want to play with some of our other dogs, too!  Harvey has been neutered, and is ready for a fresh start in a new home!  Come check out Harvey and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nPlease call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

My name is Winky and I'm smart, energetic, and the life of the party. I play well with other dogs and would benefit from having another dog in my new home. I'm seeking an active home as I really enjoy walking, hiking, going to the park, and playing fetch. I know some basic commands and would love to learn more. I am about 1.5 years old and am an aussie mix. I am neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. I am dog door trained. Contact Lidia at 480 206 3883 to find out more about me. My adoption fee is $200",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nGIORDANO is ADOPTABLE in NORTHERN CA!\n\nGiordano is a 3.5-year old male Neapolitan Mastiff, and he is a BIG boy, weighing about 160#. Gio lived his entire previous life as an outside dog, and when the neighbors repeatedly complained about his barking, his previous owner dumped him at a high kill shelter. One of our rescue partners got Giordano out of the shelter, and he is now fully vetted. They've started working on training with him, and his future family will need to continue that, and work on socialization.\n\nGiordano is potty trained, he knows \"sit\" and \"down\", and he takes treats nicely. He is not good on a leash, so needs work on that, and he startles from loud noises. Giordano has never been around other dogs, and he does not like cats, so he will need to be an only pet. It is very difficult to get Giordano into a car, so transporting him is NOT an option, and he must stay in Northern CA for that reason.\n\nGiordano is an affectionate boy who enjoys being with his humans. He appeared not to know how to play when he first came home to foster, but with time he was tugging on a giant rope toy and running zoomies in the yard. He is very smart. He learns quickly. Positive reinforcement and chicken nuggets are his go to high value reward treat. Speaking of food, Giordano doesnt like to share, so during his meal times, he should be offered his meal and left alone to eat. Due to being undersocialized, he can become insecure in situations he has not encountered before. Loud noises will at times startle him. He can be cautious and slow to respond at times. He will require patience and experience as he adjusts to his new home. He just wants to be indoors and with his family.\n\nWe realize that Giordano's stunning looks will probably attract a lot of attention, and while lots of people may want him just because of that, he is NOT the dog for just anyone. We are looking for a very specific adopter for this boy, so please don't apply for him unless you fit all of the following parameters:\n\n~ Must live within a 4-hour radius of Sacramento, CA\n~ Must own your own home\n~ Must have 6' fenced yard\n~ Must have no children under 16-years old living in the home\n~ Must have NO other pets\n~ Must have Neo experience (or experience w/ Corso, Boerboel, Presa, Fila or Tibetan Mastiff is ok, too)\n~ Must be willing to spend a lot of time with him and continue his training (Please have a plan for that)\n\nYep, we are basically looking for a unicorn, but we know the right family is out there somewhere!\n\n~ If you fit ALL of the above criteria and you're interested in adopting Giordano, please complete a family profile on our website, and we'll get in touch with you. Thanks!\n\nwww.mastinorescue.org\n\n1/28/21 2:54 PM",

Thanks to our wonderful fosters Bill and Anne in North Carolina that have decompressed and evaluated our girl we can now tell you the perfect home setting. Agnese will need to be the ONLY pet in the home, including cats. She is crate, leash, house trained and absolutely loves car rides. True to her breed she bonds very quickly with her humans, but those humans must be adults over 18. A quiet house in the country where someone is home during the day would suit her perfectly. Agnese came to us several months ago from a family that acquired her off of Craigslist, however this family had no breed experience and a very small child which was way to much for her. If you fit the criteria for our Queen please go to our webite and complete a Family Profile. You must own your home and have a privacy fence. If you are interested in Agnese or any of our magnificent Neo's please go to our website at mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile and a volunteer from our adoption team will be in contact with you.",

We couldn't let anything bad happen to her, so currently, Sweetie is temporarily camping out at Uncle Russ and Aunt Laura's house in Georgia, and transport is available to an approved home.\n\nSweetie is fully vetted and microchipped. She loves sitting in the back seat while going for car rides. She is leash and house trained, and overall, she's just a very good, easy going girl. Sweetie has been enjoying the company of a senior male Neo (Edsel, formerly Mastino Rescue's Luigi), and she loves playing with her 2 favorite toys and chilling on the sofa.\n\nOur 110-pound, blue brindle beauty desires a quiet environment and an adoring mother to fuss over her. She does take to men and strangers, but a little added time is required, as this girl only knew one home and Mom her entire life, before now.\n\nShhhhh!! Uncle Russ told me not to tell anyone so please keep our little secret. Sweetie loves curling up in bed with him and Aunt Laura at night. :)\n\nSweetie is currently located in GA, but we can arrange transport to another State, if needed. If you can find it in your heart to give this sweet, senior Neo her forever after, please go to our website (www.mastinorescue.org) and complete a Family Profile, and then someone from our Adoption Team will contact you.",

Due to the family situation sadly she was surrendered. Today, she enters her foster home to decompress. We DO know a couple of things. She has not done well with other dogs, especially small ones, and no cats. She has never lived with kids so no children under the age of 18. Mia is crate trained, house trained, leash trained and loves car rides but will need some obedience training. If you are interested in fostering to adopt Mia please fill out a Family Profile on our website and our Foster/Adoption Coordinator will contact you. Please remember: You must own your own home, have breed experience, have a 6 foot fence and no children under the age of 18. Stay tuned for updates on Mia as we get to know her.",

Bambi and Bianca previously lived strictly as outside dogs, so they will need to learn how to be cherished family pets. Bambi is dog selective but would do well with another male her size or smaller but definitely no cats! Bambi does not like being in a crate because she just wants to be with her humans so a home where someone works from home or is retired would be perfect.\n\nPictures do not do our stunning girl justice as her unique color is hard to capture. She is a petite girl weighing in at 105 pounds.\n\nHer sister Bianca has been adopted and Bambi wonders why she is still in a foster home. She loves to cuddle and lay next to the bed at night. Currently, being fostered in Texas to the ideal home transport can be arranged. If you are interested in Bambi or any of our other magnificent Neos please go to our website at Mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile and a volunteer from our adoption team will contact you.",

PLEASE CONTACT THE OWNER WHO IS LISTED BELOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING MORE ABOUT YOSHI.\n\nMeet Yoshi, an 4 year old, 80 pound half Staffordshire Terrier and half Chow dog. He is neutered and up to date with all medical care. He is a wonderful companion and a protective dog who is looking for a new home.\n\nYoshi is friendly once he gets to know you. He usually barks at least once when someone new comes in the house. He does not always get along with dogs, so he needs a home where he is the only pup. Yoshi has not been around children or cats so I am not sure how he would react.\n\nYoshi is completely housebroken. He has gone up to 10 hours without having to go outside to do his business. At night he sleeps at the foot of my bed. He is well behaved in the house so no crate is needed. Yoshi's activity level is low, he loves to relax around the house and be my buddy. He walks fine on a leash if there are no other dogs. If we see another dog, he exhibits leash reactivity, therefore Yoshi needs a home with a fenced yard.\n\nYoshi's favorite thing is being near me, especially sitting on the back porch. Yoshi is looking for his forever home that will give him the love he deserves. Would you like to meet him and see if he could be your forever companion? For more information about this handsome dog, please contact Janice at jgodfrey64@gmail.com or 919-601-6485.\n\nDISCLAIMER: We hope you'll consider adopting YOSHI. YOSHI is a courtesy listed dog. This means that he is not a part of or associated with Best Friend Pet Adoption (BFPA). The bio information listed for him was provided by his owner and not generated or verified by BFPA. Adoption arrangements will be a private arrangement between you and the owner. As with any dog adoption, BFPA encourages potential adopters to gain as much information as possible before adopting. This includes temperament testing and verification of vet records to ensure the dog is in good health, UTD on vaccinations and has been sterilized. For more information about this handsome dog, please contact Janice at jgodfrey64@gmail.com or 919-601-6485.",

He was treated very badly at the facility and was so fearful.  But once he was rescued and taken to his foster home he blossomed into the sweet loving fellow \"Charlie\" ... this guy just loves to go for walkies,  he is great on the leash and loves adventure.

JOURNEY is a precious, AdoraBull girl & she is ready to learn what living as a treasured member of a family is all about! JOURNEY does need a home as the only dog. We are currently updating JOURNEYs Petfinder listing, please email Info@nmdog.org to learn more OR to save time, directly submit your application!! (see below for more info....) \n\nAs an all volunteer, foster based, 501(c)3 non profit rescue, NMDOG is always in need of new, approved foster & adoptive homes in order to continue our Mission: to serve & protect New Mexico's Forgotten Dogs!! \n\nIf you see a dog you are interested in that says \"in need of a foster home\", we are currently seeking a temporary foster home for that dog in order to provide them with the cozy & loving experience of a home environment while we work hard to find their forever family. This also frees up space & funds, which enables us to save another life. There is never a cost to foster for NMDOG & you will have the dedicated support of the NMDOG TEAM every step of the way. We take the time to really get to know the needs & personalities of our kids & we go the extra mile to ensure we make the best possible match...setting our dogs & their humans up for success! To learn more about the NMDOG foster program & to submit the foster application, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/foster\n\nOur adoption fee is $250 which includes; a 7 week NMDOG obedience/bonding class with their new family (classes are located in Abq & are also offered to our foster guardians), a complimentary vet wellness check & our dogs come with all of the supplies they need to get started on a trial adoption in their new home. All adopted dogs also receive free or discounted goodies & services from many of our awesome community partners!! Grooming, food, training, boarding, pet sitting & more. To learn more about the NMDOG adoption process & to submit the adoption application, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/adopt \n\nNMDOG doesn't cut any corners when it comes to the care & placement of our dogs. When a dog enters the NMDOG program, they are guaranteed to receive the very best of care. All of our available dogs have received a full medical & behavioral clearance prior to placement. They are (at the very minimum) spayed or neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed, Heartworm tested & currently on HW/flea & tick preventative. Due to the nature of our work, many of the dogs we rescue need much more extensive care before they are cleared for adoption. At NMDOG, we stand by our dogs for life & we make a promise to always be there for them (& their people) should they ever need us. . \n\nPlease contact us directly via the links provided above or email info@nmdog.org with your interest in becoming a treasured NMDOG Foster Guardian or FoReVeR Guardian Angel to one of our amazing dogs in need!\nWe look forward to hearing from you & answering any questions you may have.

            "description": "\n\nMeet Rollie (pronounced like Raleigh)! Rollie was a stray that was taken in at the end of August, and we think he is about 10 months old at the moment. Because he was a stray, his breed is a bit of a mystery, but his vet thinks he's an Anatolian Shepherd. He is already quite large for his age at about 60lbs. and will likely get to be 70lbs. or more. Rollie is a very smart dog who picks up on things quickly and is housebroken, but some more training on basic commands will do him well. He loves people and can get a bit anxious when left alone for too long, so he would love to be part of a family that could give him all the attention he craves.  Rollie generally is very calm but expressive, and he is usually content with just laying with you and soaking in the pets, watching tv, or just hanging out! That being said he is still very young (despite his size), so he needs a way to work off all that energy every day. His favorite way is a walk with lots of people and squirrels around, but he is also content with fetch in a backyard. He is a great and loving dog and would love to meet you!\n\nIf you are interested in providing a loving home to this pet please complete the L.A.P. application at, https://www.laprescue.org/adoption-app-.html\n or email us at LapRescue@gmail.com\nLocal area adoptions only. Home visits are required.\nEven if you can't give this animal a home you can still help by making a donation to help with their care. Any amount you can spare will be sincerely appreciated. https://www.laprescue.org/donate.html\nThank You!",

They are both about 2 years old and almost identical in appearance and weight - one is 51 pounds, the other 52, one is lighter brindle and white, the other darker brindle and white. They act like tough guys inside their run but when you open the door they are sweet. They will sit when told. Both are  strong on leash and could benefit from leash training, Smedley is up-to-date on vaccinations, now neutered,  heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 879 using ID# 625283 for Smedley, ID# 625283. What a happy dude. Doesn\u2019t pull hard, walks with a bounce of pure happiness and sits great for treats. Stop by to meet him!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Mira is sweet, though only with those she knows and loves, which takes some time! She is part of the initiation process at the Milo Sanctuary --- not a dog for the faint of heart! A fun and lovable little toughie. Since coming to the sanctuary she has won the hearts of every person she has met, which is no surprise considering she is absolutely adorable! Mira would be happy going for hikes, she's great off leash in the country with a pack, she;s into finding adventures or just cuddling on the couch all day, though she does love adventure and needs exercise. \nMira loves people, but needs quite some time to warm up to strangers and does have the propensity to snap, when reached for, handled at her neck/collar, and if spooked or forced into interactions she isn't ready for. Because of this a home with children, or people who think they know better and will push her, would NOT be a good fit for her. With time and the proper introductions and get acquainted period, she is more than willing to roll over for belly rubs, play and give/get lots of kisses, and her nicer play bites. Mira has lived with both cats and dogs and got along with all of them very well. She is a truly \"special\" little dog and will make the right adopters, those who love a sense of adventure and are quick on their feet, with their hands and like a good laugh, very happy. She loves riding in vehicles too.\n\nIf you feel you and Mira could be a good match, and you don't have children or a social epicenter for a home environment - fun loving adults and other dogs are fine! Please send an inquiry and an adoption questionnaire to: lat@milofoundation.org",

I may need more depending on my age, puppies continue to get their vaccinations and dewormings up to 14 to 16 weeks. If I am a puppy, I will have an appt. to be altered (at our vet) my alter fee is included in the adoption donation fee. I have been treated with Frontline for fleas & ticks. Thanks soooo much for making adoption your first option - so many of my buddies need to get adopted too... so tell a friend to visit our website and help in the goal to have more pups find forever homes. If you are viewing me on Petfinder or one of the other rescue portals - please go to our main website: www.tlcwithpups.com - where you can find our adoption fees and our main profiles.

He already knows sit and to go to his crate when asked but would love to learn new tricks. He's house trained and looking for a loving indoor home. This wonderful boy has had a hard time finding his perfect match because everyone is attracted to his good looks, his love of fetch, the fact that he's dog friendly and very loving to his people BUT they forget that they have to love all of him and he does have fear aggression- this leads to lots of applicants who aren't a good match. His fear aggression means that he needs to be muzzled when around new people and is only recommended for homes without children. He will do best in a structured loving home. He's energetic and loves walks, adventures, and play time (did we mention how much he loves fetch!). Cowboy is a Texas boy with a big heart and just needs to find someone who will love him despite his initial shy nature which can lead him to be reactive. We promise that once he knows you he will LOVE you! No cats for this Cowboy.",

I am learning to be more confident on a leash but once I'm out and about its \"Look Out World\"! I'm a people-lover and kids are great but I prefer the older generation...that is 14 and older! I'd love to meet you and charm you with my smile. \n\nI would LOVE to be a family dog and need to be the only animal in the home. \n\nTo find out more about Kalie and to schedule a meet, please email contactus@pawspueblo.org.",

If I am a puppy, I will have an appt. to be altered (at our vet) my alter fee is included in the adoption donation fee. I have been treated with Frontline for fleas & ticks. Thanks soooo much for making adoption your first option - so many of my buddies need to get adopted too... so tell a friend to visit our website and help in the goal to have more pups find forever homes. If you are viewing me on Petfinder or one of the other rescue portals - please go to our main website: www.tlcwithpups.com - where you can find our adoption fees and our main profiles.

Rumor has it that you are looking for a beagle to complete your family. Well, I think I can help you out in that area. Coincidentally, I'm a beagle looking to find a family of my own.\n\nI am a pretty quiet boy. Nothing beats a good nap. As a matter of fact, I enjoy sleeping in, especially when I can lounge in bed snuggling with my humans and getting belly rubs. What a wonderful way to start the day! I've also discovered resting in the sunshine. Now that's a relaxing activity that can be enjoyed both with some company or solo.\n\nI am coming along very well on my house training; I am 90 percent perfect! Another plus is that I walk quite nicely on my leash. I admit that some loud noises do make me jump. At first it can be very scary, but once I figure out where the noise came from, I am fine. For example, my foster mom takes me for a walk near some train tracks. The first time I heard the train's horn, I nearly jumped out of my fur! But since then, I don't even acknowledge that annoying horn... no need, since I now know what it is.\n\nDid I mention that I just love to be with my humans? I will get in their laps whenever I can and encourage them to hold me like a baby. If my humans seem to want to get up, I will drape my body across their laps and hold them in position. There, now isn't that better?\n\nI also value my relationships with other canines and often spend time playing with my foster sister. It would be ideal if my new home had at least one other canine companion to keep me company. That would certainly be better than having to be alone. No one likes to be by themselves.\n\nI do hope that my new home is calm and peaceful. I'd rather not deal with chaos and excess noise. So, if you have a loving home that just needs a sweet and gentle beagle, I may just be the one you are seeking. Can't wait to meet you!\n\n\n\n------\n\nB.O.N.E.S. is a foster-home-based rescue organization serving dogs and potential adopters in the New England states. We do not have a shelter.

            "description": "Do you need a little Cinnamon in your life? \n\nWe know where you can find one! Meet our Cinnamon; the most affectionate and lovable Dachshund mix you will ever meet. And when we say affectionate, that's an understatement. He loves to curl up next to his human or take up all the space on your lap. He is good with other pups and loves to play. Do you like walks? Cinnamon does! He would be happier than anything to be your companion exploring the grass and flowers in the neighborhood. He's a man with small needs. A fenced backyard will keep him happy and safe to roam around in.\n\nCinnamon's beautiful eyes do not produce enough tears. This will be a health condition that is life-long for him. But do not fear! It's simple. All he needs is his human to apply a DAILY prescription eye ointment (Optimune) and take him in for regular check-ups to monitor his eyes. If he's not getting his daily ointment, it will be very painful for him and his beautiful eyes will be prone to infections. Can you help him this little man?\n\nHe is waiting for you to open your heart to him and bring him home. \n\nAdoption Fee: $350\nSan Francisco Bay Area adoption only.\n\nIf you would like to meet Cinnamon, please apply at http://www.lovewoof.org/our-animals:\n\nAdoption Process:\nOnce an adoption counselor receives and approves your application, they will contact you (only if you match the animal's needs) to set up an appointment to meet the dog you applied for and/or any of the other dogs in the rescue. If the dog you applied for is not a good match for your particular situation, there might be others that are better matches.\n\nAdoption Fees:\nAdoption fees allow WOOF Animal Rescue to continue to provide care and medical treatment (including spay/neuter services) for dogs while we look for their forever homes. The fees also helps cover the ongoing costs of caring for less adoptable dogs that require longer stays in the rescue, or more advanced medical treatment before finding their forever homes.\n\nWOOF Animal Rescue, in Fremont CA, does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccinations and rabies shots appropriate for their age, dewormed and microchipped.",

            "description": "All of our dogs are Spayed/Neutered, Micro-chipped, and up to date on shots before being released to adopters.NAME:MaxxSTATS:Male, Cane Corso and Great Dane Mix, 1.5 years estimate, 115 lbs.TEMPERAMENT:Shy at first and warms up.Needs seasoned owner to work with issues (see below).ActiveInitially was told he was fearful of men, which seems to be he just needs slow introductions to new people where he can approach them at his own pace. Warms up quickly to men and women as long as it is done slowly and at his pace. Initially weary of strangers. SKILLSPotty trained.Crate trained.Older children in a savvy home only (12+)Has not been exposed to cats.Has not been exposed to other dogs and looking to place as an only dog at this time.MORE ABOUT ME:Likes belly rubs.Needs patient proactive owner willing to work on behavior (see details below).Signing up for basic training will be a requirement to adopt. EXPERIENCED/large breed savvy owners required.ONE LAST THING:Maxx is a supersized puppy with lots of attention and love to give to the right family. He is goofy and loves to play, especially with an appropriately sized toy like his JUMBO Jolly-Ball. He loves treats and while he is a little on the shy side at first with new people, he warms up quickly as long as it is done at his pace. After the initial warm up phase, his true personality comes out. There is a playful side to him as well as a lazy lay at your feet side, although sometimes he may mistakenly lay on your feet in his attempt to cuddle :).Maxx initially had negative reactions when it came to strangers and pretty much everything new to him (including swaying palm trees). With reassurance, positive reinforcement in the form of treats, and looking to his handler for a confidence boost, his triggers have lost power. He will need continued socialization, desensitization, and training. With the right forever home, Maxx will continue to improve. He picks up on things very quickly and is very treat and toy motivated. He does need someone who will be patient with him, but also serve as someone who he can turn to for confidence and stability when he is unsure or frightened of something new for reassurance. If you you are interested in meeting one of the dogs, please fill out an application from our website at www.K9PawPrintRescue.org. We are always in need of fosters and volunteers",

Ozu had matting so bad he had to be full shaved, he was badly infested with fleas, had skin infections, infected eyes and ears, and was full of internal parasites. All of his medical needs have since been addressed, and he is on the mend. Despite what Ozu has endured he is still a gentle trusting soul. Once you give him a few minutes to warm up expect kisses from him! This is a very gentle, quiet fellow so an adult breed experienced home that is low key would be best. Ozu loves to play with toys, and loves to do zooms around our yard. He is treat and food motivated!\n\nInterested in this gentle soul?

I'm in the market for a home of my own. If you're looking for a new furry family member, we just may be meant for each other.\n\nI am a very good boy, and I'm happy to express my gratitude to my humans for rescuing me. My face often says \"I love you,\" and my snuggles just reinforce it. As a matter of fact, I love people so much that I am much happier when my human is home for at least a good part of the day. Of course, I also love other dogs and would not mind having some canine companionship as well.\n\nI already know some things that will surely make my new humans happy. I am house trained as well as crate trained, although I am well behaved enough that I don't need to use the crate at all. I even know the commands \"sit\" and \"come\" and am eager to learn as much as you want to teach me.\n\nSome of my favorite activities are chilling with my foster siblings, playing with my toys, and running around the yard trying to identify all the wonderful scents... squirrel, chipmunk, hmmmm.... stinky.... oh, skunk! I'll stay away from that one! I don't even mind inclement weather. I'll happily run around in the rain. It's fun!\n\nMy foster parents say I'm a very sweet pup. I think they are pretty special, too. I really do like being a loved family member. I am pretty brave because thunder and fireworks do not faze me. They're just loud noises. However, that vacuum has got to go. No, it's not just a loud noise. That machine makes things disappear! I saw a fur ball, and then it was gone! I'm staying as far away from that thing as possible. I don't want to get sucked into it.\n\nWhile I like playing and being active, cuddling up with my family is awesome. At night, I hop into bed with everyone and curl up for a cozy night's sleep. There really is nothing better than being loved. Now that you know all about me, I sure hope you will consider welcoming me into your family. I would be forever grateful.\n\n\n\n------\n\nB.O.N.E.S. is a foster-home-based rescue organization serving dogs and potential adopters in the New England states. We do not have a shelter.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nBetty and Barney\n\nBetty is a CoJack (Corgi-Jack Russell) girl of about 3-4 years of age found wandering on the streets. Betty had been there for a while and was living on garbage. This sweet girl was picked up on a 106-degree day dehydrated and weak by a Bakersfield rescue group that rescues street dogs. Barney is a Corgi-Jack Russell boy of about 6 years of age who was also picked up as a stray and cared for by his finder until she found us to take him in.\n\nBetty and Barney have been in foster care. They have developed a deep bond being with one another and do everything together. They are like a little married couple, it is sooo cute!\n\nBoth dogs love attention, are super sweet and cuddly, love their daily walks on a lead and hanging out with their foster mom. They will benefit by being with a retired individual or couple who will have more time to spend with them. Both dogs love their walks, exploring and seeing new things. They will also lose weight faster and rebuild their muscles the more they get out and exercise, so an active person or couple is a must for these two sweeties\n\nBetty and Barney have been treated for Parasites and are up to date on their vaccines. Both dogs are being fed a diet of Human Grade Dog food and Raw dog food. Both dogs receive supplements for health, joint care, and weight loss. Betty had come in bloated and heavy from living on garbage as a stray. Barney was overfed by the person who rescued him. Heather, their foster mom has been working to trim them down and rebuild their muscle mass. Both are looking wonderful, have trimmed down and are happy dogs.\n\nRompin Paws Rescue will educate the adopters on species-specific feeding and Canine nutrition for longevity, ultimate health, and vitality.\n\nTo fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application. Betty and Bareny have a bonded pair adoption fee of $1050.00. this covers their neuters, all vaccines and rabies and their care. All monies are recycled to save more dogs\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.",

We have marked him to be a medium sized dog when grown but there is always the possibility that he could go over 60#.

He had spend the majority of his previous life outside in a not-so-large yard and while he is quite people friendly and outgoing, he doesn't know a lot about house rules and polite leash walking and people greeting. He is very much a \"Diamond in the rough with a little dirt on it\", he is food motivated and learns quickly, but is also a little stubborn and single-minded: he LOVES squirrels - likely one of his few entertainments in his small yard. He gets along well with other dogs after proper introduction - due to his lack of knowledge of rules and manners he tends to be inappropriate and a little \"humpy\". He is reasonably polite when meeting other dogs but would much prefer to be the only dog in his home.\n\nStallone is looking for a moderately dog-experienced home without another dog in it, older kids may be fine. He has moderate exercise requirements and a good daily walk should suffice for him.\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet  and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

Theo had been in boarding for over a year, and with her issues not resolved, she made the hard decision that it wasn't fair to Theo for him to remain in a boarding kennel. Theo is an absolutely great dog! He is happy to make both human and doggy friends :) He is way too interested in cats for them to live together. Theo would love a home with a fenced yard for playtime, although that is not an absolute requirement. He would like a family to take him on walks - even hikes - and new adventures :)\n\nTo adopt please fill out the application at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

He is just lovely and friendly with all people. Sam is a huge couch potato. He loves his walks but may not be the best hiker!  Sam is good with most dogs in his weight class and size, but a dog introduction is required to ensure he is placed with a compatible dog.  A home with older children or adults only is preferred.  He would do best with a a dog-sophisticated owner.  \n\nPlease email us if you are interested in meeting Sam! We are sure he would love to meet you too.\ninfodewpaws@gmail.com",

Laddy has been in board and train with our good friends at Royal K-9 Academy for the past few weeks. He went from cowering in his kennel to going out for walks, hanging out with the pack and out volunteers. Laddy was not treated very well and it has taken him a little longer to trust, but we are so proud of him. Laddy needs a patient owner who will continue to help build his confidence and remind him humans are good. Laddy is great on the leash and good with other dogs. Laddy is very sweet and gentle. Let's find this special boy the family he deserves!\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\nLaddy is located in Southern California.",

            "description": "Our Lizzie Baby is ready for adoption and looking for her forever home!!\n\nShe is about 2 years old, and currently in Washington state with her AMAZING foster family and Dogo foster brother. Her foster family has worked so hard with her - she has been going through training and socializing and is becoming a very good girl!\n\nLizzie Baby loves playing, running, cuddling, and chicken nuggets (who doesn\u2019t?!) She is food motivated and willing to learn.\n\nHer ideal home would be one with a large yard and an extra tall fence (she can climb a chain link fence!) Lizzie Baby needs a family who has Dogo/large breed experience who will understand all of her quirks and needs. Someone who is extra patient with her as she is still learning.\n\nLizzie Baby can be around male dogs if the family is very experienced. She is learning to be around cats, and is ok with them most of the time, but her ideal home would be one where she is the only pet and can receive all the attention. She is very loving, but we do not feel she would do best in a home with children at this time.\n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

            "description": "Xena is a a true warrior with a tender heart. She craves love and affection from her people but is also an independent girl. Xena is good with other dogs if properly introduced but prefer a home with no other dominate females. She loves her male dogo brother and plays hard with him so a dog that is equal in size (she is a smaller female approx 75 lbs) and can keep up with her energy is ideal. She is very athletic with high prey drive so she will need a home with a secure 6ft privacy fence. Xena loves to play catch and her favorite toy is a squeaky ball. She also loves blankets and will drag it around the house and make herself a comfy spot to sleep in. She needs a home where they will be consistant with training and giving her boundries. She is very food motivated and is eager to learn. Carrot are one of her favorite treats. Xena would thrive in a very active home with no small children. She is currently located in  Cincinnati OH. Transport can be arranged to approved homes. \n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

            "description": "Valerie was saved after jumping into a lady's car after clearly being neglected for a long time. Valerie needs a foster ASAP!!\n\nValerie AKA Queen Bee is a spunky, sassy 2 year old Dogo with so much love to give she finds it hard to keep quiet! \nHer favorite things include snuggles, long walks & car rides, treats... and did we mention she loves snuggles?\n\nValerie is heartworm positive but doesn't let that bring her down. She'd love a foster to go through treatment with, and when she's done she'd love a soft, warm bed in a home to call her own and maybe a friendly, submissive dog friend or two. Valerie is currently located in Houston, TX, but the thought of a road trip to her forever home makes her happy, so transport could be arranged for the right home. \n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

            "description": "Brisby is a 4 year old Red and White Border/Aussie Mix. He weighs around 45 pounds. Brisby is an outgoing pup who loves to meet new people. He can be very bouncy with new humans.  Brisby is super sweet and thinks he is a lap dog. He's good with men and women, he's quite velcro, but he doesn't seem anxious when people leave him.\n\nBrisby is very calm in his New York foster apartment, but he seems a bit bored. He could really benefit from having access to a yard, and daily stimulation and exercise. He hates loud booms (got seriously frightened on New Year's Eve from the amateur fireworks going off -- it took him hours to calm down). He is a sweet dog, but not a lapdog -- he likes to watch and monitor his people from across the room, preferably where he can see all of them at once.\n\n?Brisby will take your arm off to run after a squirrel. His strong prey drive means that you have to have a plan when walking him near trees. High-value treats and a lot of walking practice have helped, but his next owner should be prepared to work on his chase habit to make walks safe and enjoyable for everyone. \n\nBrisby's prey drive is also strong enough to suggest that he cannot share a home with cats (he almost went through a cemetery fence trying to catch a neighborhood stray). Brisby is GREAT with people -- quite calm, especially with coaching. But Brisby lunges at dogs -- even after a lot of training walks -- so that can make walks a little stressful.?\n\nBrisby does great sleeping in a kennel overnight, but he's not crazy about being left in the kennel while his people are out of the house (prepare to return home and find that everything you placed on top of the kennel is now next to the kennel -- that kind of thing). It seems safe to say now that Brisby is housebroken, and he's easy to read when he wants to go out, but he is leaky -- he wets a bit in his sleep if he hasn't gone out recently (just little spots you'll notice on his belly).\n\nBrisby is fostered in New York, NY.\n\nTo apply to adopt visit www.ns4ar.org",

            "description": "Breed: Alaskan Malamute \nDOB: ~01/04/2016\nWeight: 100 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium-High\nPersonality Type: Snuggly, Loyal, Independent, People-Oriented \nHistory: Transferred from another shelter/owner surrender\nFence Requirements: Physical fence required.\nIdeal Home: Active family! Breed experience preferred.\nSpecial Info: Please research the breed before applying! Nokosi is very much a Malamute!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Hey there friends!! Meet Buddy!!! Buddy is a 5 year old, pitty/beagle mix, and he is just the most handsome boy!!! Buddy was surrendered to us due to his pervious family moving and being unable to take him with them due to his breed! Buddy had been with them his whole life as their indoor, family dog!! The previous owners described him as well behaved, active, and playful!! They also said he did well with their children!! Buddy is a large and confident boy. Sometimes he even thinks he is the boss, lol! But he is smart, he takes commands, he loves to play, and is BEYOND loyal to his people. He knows how to sit, shake, fetch (even though he doesn't always bring it right back lol), and he is house broken!! Unfortunately, Buddy was not very socialized with other animals. Therefore, he will need to be the only animal in the home. He can also be timid and cautious when meeting new people! So his new owners would have to be understanding of his need to be introduced slowly! However, once he warms up he is a really sweet and playful doggy!! He does tend to bark at people and other animals that he is not familiar with, but it is just because he is uncomfortable, once he actually meets the person he calms right down!!! He has been with us for a little while and we are really hoping to find him his forever home soon!! He is neutered, vaccinated, and dewormed! His adoption fee is $80!! Who out there is willing to give this very sweet boy a chance??!? He MORE than deserves it!!",

            "description": "Breed: German Shepherd mix\nSex: Male\nDOB: ~09/26/2016\nWeight: 47 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Happy-go-lucky, wiggly, BFF, but initially timid! Doesn't jump into new relationships blindly.\nHistory: Transferred in from animal control/stray\nIdeal Home: Low traffic home with no other pets. No apartments. No kids (teenagers ok!). A privacy fence is preferred.\nSpecial Notes: Jonas requires a slower introduction with new people. He can be timid around strangers. Jonas' adoption fee includes one free session with our trainer.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Olympia. My foster mom calls me Limpy. I\u2019m a female 8 month old medium-sized (33 pounds) Staffie/Cattle dog/Chihuahua mix originally from New Orleans. I\u2019m visually impaired but my keen hearing and sense of smell help me get around with ease. My whole backside wags all the time because I am so happy! \n\nI am crate trained and even know a few commands such as sit, paw and will nudge the bell to be let outside. I think I finally got this potty training thing down but please be patient with me as I\u2019m still a puppy. \n\nMy foster brother is over 90 pounds but that doesn\u2019t stop me from trying to battle with him on a daily basis, however, I can also entertain myself. Because I have a lot of energy, my ideal home would be with another playful dog and a fenced yard for me to run. Walks are more fun with my foster brother who helps to guide me on the path. I do well around other dogs but haven\u2019t had a chance to learn about cats yet. Young children might be scared by my jumpiness since I hold up my paws to learn about things around me but I'm working on the command \"down\". I am spayed, microchipped, and UTD on my shots.  Do you have room in your heart and in your home for me?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

            "description": "CROSS POST: **Please read Mia's entire profile, which includes a link to the adoption application. She is at GREAT DOG NEW ENGLAND, not Rock n' Rescue. Thank you!**\n\nMeet Mia - a 2 year old, 55 pound, Plott Hound mix gal.\n\nMia is looking for a very special family! Mia is an active girl who loves to run and play fetch. She will need a fenced in yard. If you do not have a fenced in yard, she needs a quiet neighborhood and needs to work on walking on a leash. Mia is a rough player with other dogs so we suggest she is the only dog in the home. She is not aggressive with other dogs so we think she will do fine with play dates - she just prefers to get all your attention. She also should not live with cats. She rides well in the car and can use more leash training as she is very barky when approaching other dogs on a walk. She is great with little kids - very patient and affectionate with little ones and happy to run and play with bigger kids. She\u2019s crate trained, knows \u2018sit\u2019 & \u2018wait\u2019 and that \u2018go nunnites\u2019 means to go to her dog bed in the bedroom to go to bed for the night. She will bark for a moment at guests when they come over but she stops once they can meet and people really love her.\n\nMia is epileptic, and is on a few daily medications. She has an emergency med for the 24 hours after she has a seizure and uses CBD oil daily. With her meds and the new CBD oil, she\u2019s been seizure free for over a month now. She will need to see a vet every 6 months to take blood to make sure her blood levels are okay on her current meds.\n\nMia is going to require a patient owner who can deal with managing her energy and her epilepsy - but anyone who takes this on is going to feel the rewards of her love and affection for years to come!\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption. All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Mia, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495] ** PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted.

            "description": "I am a sweet young lady looking for a loving home. I came to the shelter and having had a serious old injury or birth defect to my back, leaving me looking a bit different. I will need, at the very least, a lifetime of close monitoring, joint supplementation and supportive medications as needed. The vet I saw here feels I would do best having a neurology consult, and there is not someone locally that specializes in canine neurology. There may be many therapies that benefit me in the long run, and I need an adopter willing and able to take on the potential long term needs I have. All I want to do is cuddle and play. If you are looking for a worthy and devoted life partner, who needs a leg up, as they say, please ask to meet me! \nMy foster says I am a true joy: I'm affectionate, playful, smart, and energetic. I love to snuggle up with anyone who will sit on a couch -- or the floor-- with me. I warm up quickly to strangers, and am super-excited to see other creatures outside. (That is, I bark at every deer, squirrel, chipmunk, bird, etc.:) I learn things very quickly such as wiping my feet when I come in the door!",

In my past life, I sustained an injury which hasn't left me with any visible scars, but has left me with urinary and fecal incontinence. I am extremely mobile (you would honestly have no idea by looking at me), and I love to play! I don't mind wearing a diaper at all - there's a fun song that goes with it and it usually means we're about to do something exciting! I've been in a foster home where I'm going on lots of adventures but I believe that my best adventures are yet to come, when I find my forever home. \n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

If you don't know the age, breed, weight, what vet care we provide our dogs, the adoption fee, or how to apply, you have not read the write-up. \n\nCoach\n\nBreed: Shih Tzu mix\nGender: Male, neutered\nDOB:   9-27-2004\nWeight:  ~8 pounds  \nMicrochipped  \nAdoption Fee:  $75\n\nThis old boy had a loving family that grew forgetful and were no longer able to remember to feed him and groom him properly. They surrendered him to a vet we know and so he came to us. Coach is a lovely old boy and is very affectionate! He just needs a home where he can live out his final years in peace, with comfort and companionship. No heroics are required, just good food, preventative meds (heartworm and flea) and regular grooming!

I am 8 years old and weigh about twelve pounds. I am a blind sweet little chihuahua. Yes, I may be totally blind but I use my sense of smell, hearing and touch on my princess feet to navigate around and my foster mommy says I do an amazing job of finding my way around. Bunny gets along with other dogs and is great with people. She loves to be held on your lap to enjoy her favorite pass time of napping. She will need patience and time to adjust. The person that falls in love with her will need to understand that although she is totally dependent on them, she also needs space. It's much like having a child that's learning to walk. You want to protect them but if they don't fall a few times they will never learn. I truly believe there is a home for every dog and I know someone out there will be willing to give her a chance.

She was rescued from a shelter along with her newborn pups. \n\n\nUPDATE FROM FOSTER - 10/15 :\n\"Lolly is a very sweet girl. When she was rescued, she was extremely scared of everything when she arrived (video on facebook). \n\nSince then, Lolly has blossomed into a very sweet loving dog. She still does get scared in new surroundings and takes a little while to warm up to new people, but once she knows she can trust you, she will be your best friend. Lolly does get very excited for attention and loves belly rubs. She has not given kisses but she is not afraid to stick her nose in your face to let you know when she wants your attention. \n\nShe is crate trained and is partially house trained. She does have accidents when she gets scared. She rides very well in cars. She does well on a harness and leash. She is good for baths and will need to be brushed about once a week. She does shed some.  She is protective of her food around cats, especially. Otherwise, she does well with dogs and cats after slow introductions. \n\nLolly is a bit hand shy about anything going over her head. She just gets a little nervous. We have been working with her to help this. It would just need to be reinforced by her new owner. \n\nShe would do well in a quieter home with, hopefully, someone who is around often. She will just need to be worked with slowly to help experience the world and grow more confident in her surroundings. Given love, patience, and time - Lolly can become a truly amazing dog.\"\n\n\n\n\nFee is $275",

            "description": "Doggie Bonez would like to introduce Kitty!\n\nKitty is a seven-year-old female Boxer Shepherd mix. Healthy, vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed.\n\nSadly, Kitty's owner passed away, and this poor sweetie ended up being dumped at a high kill shelter. We were lucky to rescue her from the Downey shelter, and now she is so happy to be in a foster home. Here, Kitty gets to go to the Laguna Beach dog park and even goes to work at her foster's store. Yes, she is a working dog!\n\nKitty behaves perfectly inside their house and is potty trained. But this Kitty definitely has to say NO to cats. She loves spending time with adults and would be good with older kids. We know she didn't live with young children in her previous home. She is super smart, affectionate, loving, and just wants to live a happy, relaxing existence in her golden years!!!\n\nKitty is a wonderful, loving dog, and she would love to have a yard to hang out and run around.\nIf you want to get to know Kitty better, please submit a completed adoption application found at www.doggiebonez.com, so that we can schedule a meet and greet. She can also be found on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our\npups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome\nnew short or long-term doggie foster families. We much appreciate the\nhelp and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and\nsafety of a home, and we supply you with everything else you may need,\ndog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if required), etc. If you\nare interested, please visit\nwww.doggiebonez.com\nto see all of our\navailable dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their\nfur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

            "description": "Ben is a highly intelligent and loving dog in need of an owner with an active lifestyle.  Ben will thrive given a thorough and committed training and exercise plan.  He adores playing ball, and if the ball or toy squeaks, all the better.  He will be at your side even when just doing chores but would love to be active in agility or tracking.  Ben needs to be the only dog in the home, no cats or any other small animals!  \n\nThe Belgian Malinois breed dates back to the 1800s.  This intelligent and highly trainability breed was originally bred as a sheep-herding dog, \n\nThe dogs in our program come with an additional four weeks of integration training after adoption. Integration training is one-on-one training with you, your new pet, and a trainer at Clearwater Dog Training, 1446 Estes St. Lakewood, CO  80215   For this reason we do not adopt dogs out of state.\n\nAt NSC, we believe the key to a successful placement is proper training. This way the dog knows what is expected of him, and you know how to communicate effectively with your dog. \n\nIf you would like more information or even better would like to meet this dog, please contact Gina at 720-514-2543 or at gina@nscrescue.org. Meet and greet appointments are available M-T & Saturdays.\n\nPlease visit www.nscrescue.org to complete an adoption application to help us know a little about you.\n\nWe try to the best of our ability to represent the breed, age, and health as accurately as possible; however, as many of these animals come to us with no previous history, in some cases we are going off of educated guesses. Please be aware that while many dogs may appear purebred, there is no guarantee without a DNA check.",

He can climb a 6 foot chain link fence, so he might benefit from a privacy fence with no foothold!  He should also respond well to an invisible fence.  Once filled out, Everest should weigh about 65 lbs.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Mike (mike.finucane66@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.\nOnline Adoption Application \nAnimal Profile:\n\n- Pet Name: Bo\n- Primary Breed: WCAC has Bo listed as Akita/ Mixed Breed. The current fosters also fostered in March 2020 Bo's sibling brother and litter mate Didley before rehoming Didley. The fosters had a DNA analysis done on Didley which reflected 36.5% Chow Chow, 16% Redbone Coonhound, 10% Australian Shepherd, 8.5% Border Collie, 7% German Shepard , 6% Collie, 16% Supermutt.\n- Age: DOB 6/5/2018 - 2 years 4 Months\n- Gender: Male Neutered\n- Color: Solid Dark Blonde with light Tan underbelly.\n- Estimated weight: Approx 50 lbs.\n- Size: Medium\n- Microchip Info: 985112009463145 (Home Again)\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nCurrently, Bo is with WCAC volunteers Mike & Cyndi Finucane who are fostering him in their home. He has been with us for one (1) week) and has done well following another short shelter stay after a likely high stress home environment, particularly when the adopter husband was present. Care should be given introducing new men to BO. Bo will likely not engage them and the strange man should not push himself on Bo for the introduction. Trust takes time with Bo particularly with men. It is not likely Bo will bond with men quickly.\nIt has taken Bo several days in our home for him to begin to relax and settle in. He is respectful in the home; no marking or accidents so we are comfortable saying he is housebroken. He does not chew and he enjoys his 'quiet time' usually in a crate with door open. We have the crate placed near where we spend most of our day when inside. He does not like the crate door closed so we would not consider him crate trained. Bo is a slow eater in the AM but eats a healthy early evening meal of dry kibble with goodies added in: (chicken (thighs, livers or gizzards), green beans, squash, cottage cheese, pumpkin (AM) etc.\nBo is very respectful of our two female smaller senior dogs 14 & 11 years of age and has bonded with and plays well with our 2 year old male Coonhound both in the house and in our fenced yard. I would describe their play style as low level rough & rowdy wrestle with occasional chase in the yard. He loves his long walks and the freedom of his fenced back yard with our other dogs. Bo lays quietly with us and our other three dogs following his last walk after evening meal as the household unwinds before last potty break and bedtime. He sleeps all night in his dog bed.\n\nBehavioral Observations: 9/30/20 to Present\n\n- Good with Children: Unknown but would suggest older children who can respect the dog and his personality.\n- Housebroken: Yes\n- Crate Trained: Partially. Bo will go into his crate for quiet time and naps but does not like the crate door closed.\n- Friendly: Yes to women he knows and has established a relationship and trust with. He prefers women versus men. Once again with time and trust established with a man he will tolerate a man but not necessarily readily engage with affection and play. He will allow men to walk him. It is not likely that Bo will bond with men quickly.\n- Commands: Knows Sit and wait for leashing up. Will sit for treats. Will wait at thresholds once the wait command is given and then 'OK' or 'Yes' for release.\n- Submissive: Yes towards women he knows and has a relationship with.\n- Chews: No\n- Jumps: Occasionally when excited to see women he knows.\n- Chases: Occasionally with his selective dog companion in play. Has not displayed any predator drive (chasing squirrels, rabbits etc.)\n- Good with Dogs: Tolerant of all but Selective with his companions.\n- Special Needs: None\n- Playful: Occasionally on his terms. has not shown interest in play toys.\n- Leash Trained; Yes. Does well on a slip lead harness and or Martingale flat collar.\n- Claws: No\n- Destructive: No\n- Good with Cats: Unknown\n- Noisy: No. Is a very quiet dog\n- Aggressive: No. Has shown no resource guarding of food, water, treats, toys or places (dog beds, crates etc.) Has shown No aggression toward other dogs or people.\n- Digs: No\n- Fears: Can be fearful of new people, places and experiences. This is overcome in time with a 'GO SLOW' approach in all things new.",

            "description": "Welcome Kane to CCPAL Rescue.  He is a wonderful 8-month-old pup.   We think he is a Terrier/Kelpie mix.   He is alert, energetic and ready to go on a new adventure.  He likes all people and is with a number of dogs off leash in the rescue.  He is energetic and a bit too much fun for the more laid-back dogs.    He will need to join an athletic family.  Someone who runs, walks or does daily exercise would be the type of owner best suited for him.  He is mouthy when he wants your attention.  He would be best with kids 10 or older due to his exuberant attitude.    He is currently in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with one of the transporters to deliver him to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  He is healthy, up on his shots and ready to join his new family.  His adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185. Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states.\n \nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.  Online applications at www.ccpal.info/    See his cute video!!\n",

            "description": "Anoemy was saved from a high kill shelter in Texas . \n\nAnoemy was clearly afraid and showed severe her teeth to the vet staff in Texas . Every day she became more aggressive when vet staff wanted to take her out of the kennel . \n\nWhen we have dogs that are a high risk for the public we have no other choice then to put them down but my instinct said there is more going on . \nI called the owner of our boarding place in Texas to do some test after one of the girls was bitten in her leg . The tests were negative but Anoemy has now a bite record and the staff became afraid of her . \n\nBefore everybody becomes a keyboard warrior . Dogs who are coming from the kill shelters are on a transport of 4 hours long . They come in a hospital environment with strange noises and smells and easily become aggressive. On top of that most of our dogs are highly abused . The fear is real and a bite is not far off . This is one of the reasons why we have often months dogs in our kennels to let them decompress and will NEVER adopt straight from transport . \n\nUnfortunately our boarding place was full and time was ticking . Anoemy could not stay at our vet and became a high risk for the staff . Luckily a befriended rescue give me the name of another boarding place who was specialized in aggressive dogs . \n\nIt was love on first sight. Anoemy went in Austin te but after that she was swimming in the owner his swimming pool. Anoemy was relaxed and sweet . The whole placed adored her and had tears when she was leaving For NY . \n\nShe went In boarding at our vet in Huntington and a little bit later she started to limp . X -rays were taken and Anoemy needed a TPLO surgery and a FHO after they saw that she had hip dysplasia and a torn cruciate . \n\nAnoemy became a gorgeous full fur dog again after intens rehab for months and is doing great. \n\nAs a rescue we have to tell you that she has a bite record at the vet in Texas . At our vet in NY she gave no problems and was a total sweetheart . \n\nShe is 4.5 years old and needs to be pet only . \n\nShe is active but extreme hiking is not allowed . \n\nAnoemy is an alpha dog and would be better placed by experienced shepherd owners . Adult only homes . \n\nShe is located in Middle Island NY \n\nWe would love to see this sweet lady who overcome her abuse in a loving home before the holidays. \n\nTo become her new family please fill in the adoption link to find on our website ww.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one",

He is incredible with puppies, so patient and plays endlessly with them. He loves water and can often be found just laying in the kiddie pool. He is shy with meeting people at first, given time and playing ball he warms up. \n\nDuke has a best friend and is BONDED with Cotton, a 4 1/2 year old pocket pitbull.  Duke's personality comes alive when Cotton is by his side.  These two are loyal companions and inseparable.  If you're interested in adopting or fostering Duke & Cotton, contact us at adopt@azhartt.org for more information.",

He knows some commands.\n\nAt this point, I am not sure how Trigger would do in an apartment. He will bark, but it's usually when our dogs are barking.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Trigger, complete the Adoption Application on our website at www.NeedyPaws.org and we will contact you. Adopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nTrigger's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

He can be a bit temperamental and likes to push boundaries to see how far he can get so it\u2019s important that Bruno be in an environment that can offer him structure and with someone that is confident. He doesn\u2019t like to be bothered when he is sleeping or resting in his area but this does subside once he learns to trust you. He does have some resource guarding issues and a protective nature, so for this reason Bruno should be in an adult only home that has a calm environment that will provide him with the structure that he needs. He is a pretty independent and confident dog so we are looking for a human to match.\n\nBruno does enjoy playing with other dogs around his size but has some leash aggression so he is currently using a \u201cgentle leader\u201d head collar and is showing improvement already in just a week. This cute little guy just needs to be with someone that has the time and patience to continue to work with him on training and he really is a great dog.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:\n1.       Visit www.dogswithoutborders.org\n2.      Then fill out an online ADOPTION APPLICATION -  http://dogswithoutborders.org/adopt-a-dog/adoption-application/\n3.       Please wait to hear from our representative in approximately 48 hours on weekdays.\n4.

She was tick infested, appeared to have had many litters, worn down teeth (filed), and many scars.\nShe was most likely used as a bait and puppy mill dog and through it all she\u2019s as sweet as can be.  If there\u2019s has ever been a dog more deserving to live the rest of her life as a loving family member she\u2019s one of them.  \nShe's currently with her foster now and at least enjoying life probably better than ever.  Her appetite is very good and she really likes some soft food mixed with her kibble.  She is totally ready for adoption as she is spayed, shots up to date, and chipped.  \n",

To meet Boris, see the contact information below.\n\nFCIA rescued Boris, a Rottweiler mix, from the shelter after his previous owner surrendered him due to his medical needs. He is 5 years old and weighs 82 pounds. He was suffering from chronic fungal and bacterial skin infections that had left him nearly bald, underweight, and with severe ear infections. Despite this, he remained very sweet and loving. After almost a year in our care that included intense and frequent medical tests and treatment, he is finally medically stabilized. He is happy, healthy and his coat is full and lush. Boris will require lifelong medication and routine vet checks. He is now on thyroid meds 2 times a day, iron supplements daily, an autoimmune shot every 10 days, and a special diet that controls his allergies. He remains sweet and loving and very playful with most other dogs. He does tend to guard his yard and person so needs an adopter with Rottweiler experience and one who is prepared to continue his health routine.\n\nBoris is so ready and deserving of his forever home. If you are that person, please contact us at FCIAadoptions@aol.com for more information.\n\nAs we are currently not having any adoption events, we are asking interested people to please fill out our application at www. FCIAnimals.org and if it looks like a good match, we will arrange an introduction.\n\nWe suggest a home with children over the age of 10 for this dog. This dog cannot be adopted out of state. Please see our home page for a list of our Saturday adoption sites. Every potential adopter is required to fill out an adoption application and the dog is placed in the home that would be most suitable for the dog. We do not place our dogs in homes with unfenced swimming pools. Generally, we don't release the dogs at the adoption site that day except on occasion to former adopters.",

            "description": "Maria - approx one year old. Must have other dog in the home. Kids over 12. Timid girl.\n\nMeet Maria! This cutie came to us after being found roaming in the outskirts of Yakima. She was very scared and clearly unsocialized with people. She was found with her sister Mitzi.\n\nBoth girls are still quite shy with people and anyone who falls in love with them needs to understand that they still need to work on building confidence. They love their foster family but meeting strangers is still a challenge. They are especially wary of men. We prefer to see them in a female-only home.\n\nThey do not have a lot of experience walking on leashes just yet, so that is something that will need to be worked on. They go in and out of the doggy door in their foster home and love zooming around the yard together. Mitzi and Maria can be placed separately but must have another small friendly dog in the home that they can live with. They will not do well as only dogs.\n\nMaria is a young pup with everything that comes with that - she likes to play all day long, shred toys and snuggle.\n\nThe girls have been vaccinated and microchipped and spayed.\n\nTheir adoption fee is $395. Applications to savinggreatanimals.org\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

I don't like to share my food. I would benefit from leash training. I like to be the king of the castle so living in an adult-only home where I can be the center of attention would be absolutely perfect for me. I'm a little picky with my dog friends so a proper introduction would be nice. I am eager to find my best fit in a furever home. Come meet me today! I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home.",

Although it is managed through several medications, daily baths with medicated shampoos and weekly vet check-ups, flare-ups can and most likely will occur throughout the course of her life. Dogs with this disease are prone to have more infections than dogs without the disease and need to be monitored closely. In spite of all these changes and obstacles, Leesha had to endure in her 9 years, she is a very sweet dog that tolerates cats and childrenIf interested, please apply at www.adorepetrescue.org/adoption",

Submit an adoption application online at www.moaspets.com/adoptionapp, and our Program Coordinator will set up a meet and greet!**\n\nFoster update:\n\n\"\"I have had Araina for a few weeks now, and she has gone through a beautiful transformation during that time. First and foremost, this lady is now referred to as Reina, the Spanish word for Queen, because that is exactly who she is! \n\nAs a spry senior - she knows herself, what she wants, and what she likes - simple as that. Reina is independent, self-sufficient, and just needs a warm, loving home that honors her wishes. Those wishes include:\n\n- Daily walks - of course, she will let you know when her schedule allows. She is, however, willing to rearrange prior commitments for walks in the woods.\n\n- Visits to the dog park a few times a week - obviously, she alerts when she is tired of all the commoners and wants to retire to her own chambers.\n\n- Car rides - all the car rides, with open windows. Note: she simply adores the front seat.\n\nLike any queen, Reina has a heart of gold, but you may have to be patient as you work to gain her trust. She keeps a close inner circle, appearing as shy, skittish, and untrusting at first. She is aware of her royal status and is not the first to come running up for pets and love, but when you gain her trust, and she finally surrenders to your attempts at affection, it makes it all worthwhile.\n\nReina has made an excellent guest at my home. She can be left alone without being crated (though she is crate trained) and has not touched anything in the house. Being fully house trained, Reina uses a dog door here but will alert you by sitting at the door if she needs to go outside. She is dog friendly to respectful dogs and currently lives with fellow seniors, a black lab, and a heeler. Our Queen has been tested with younger dogs as house guests and does well with them, removing herself when they get in her face too much. She has been kid-tested with children as young as 6, and I think she would do well with older kids 10+ who can respect her boundaries. Reina still has a zest for life in her and would do well with a home that can provide daily exercise, 30 minutes to an hour, for her. She does well at the dog park, and after a few minutes on a leash while walking, settles without pulling. Other than that, Reina loves to hang out on the couch - she is a great Netflix buddy, WFH colleague, and the best package delivery announcer. She is just the right mix of chill and active, loving but not a velcro dog, and would make any home happy with her little woofs throughout the day.\"\"\n\n\nAriana was an owner surrender and every time she in out in the yard, she runs to the fence to look in the parking lot. She is convinced her owner is coming back. But what she doesn't know is that one day one of those cars is going to take her to her new home. She hasn't settled in here yet, but she is coming around. She is happy to show off her tricks in the meantime, to keep us humans entertained. We are seeing more and more of her personality. She is a smart and very loyal companion. In testing her with other dogs, we learned that she might be happy with other dogs that also like to mind their own business and won't get in her space uninvited.\n\n-----\n<br>Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nHerbie and Henry were rescued from a terrible hoarding situation.  They are very timid at first but Henry warms up very fast.  Neither one of them bite or snap but they are just needing time to trust.  They are so cute and very bonded.  Herbie is 4 pounds and about 8 years old.  Henry is a lot more outgoing and comes to me for affection after just having them a few days.  He is very protective of Herbie and will lay on him to protect him.   Henry is about 9 pounds and 7 years old.  \n\nBoth dogs are neutered, up to date on shots, hw negative and microchipped.  Their fee is $550 for the pair. You can also read more about us here: https://www.thepupblog.com/post/meet-henry-herbie\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nHerbie and Henry were rescued from a terrible hoarding situation.  They are very timid at first but Henry warms up very fast.  Neither one of them bite or snap but they are just needing time to trust.  They are so cute and very bonded.  Herbie is 4 pounds and about 8 years old.  Henry is a lot more outgoing and comes to me for affection after just having them a few days.  He is very protective of Herbie and will lay on him to protect him.   Henry is about 9 pounds and 7 years old.  \n\nBoth dogs are neutered, up to date on shots, hw negative and microchipped.  Their fee is $550 for the pair. You can also read more about us here: https://www.thepupblog.com/post/meet-henry-herbie\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

It\u2019s no wonder that she can be a bit shy, but also not surprising that once she feels comfortable, she wants all of the love and attention she can get.  Sasha is around 1 year old and 40 lbs.  She currently lives with four other dogs in her foster home and we think that she would be best in a home with another friendly dog.  Sasha is a sweet girl who loves belly rubs and just looking for a warm, cuddly spot on the couch.  \n\nIf you are interested in Sasha, please complete our adoption application by accessing the following link: https://fs29.formsite.com/RDR1/AdoptionApp/index.html\n\nIf you have any questions about Sasha, please email carol@realdogrescue.org. Please keep in mind that Real Dog Rescue is run solely by volunteers. We aim to process applications and respond to emails as quickly as possible, and we appreciate your patience.  Thank you.",

She takes several days to warm up to new people and allow her to pet her. She would do best in an adult only home. If you are willing to earn her love, she will pay it back tenfold. She is very afraid of a leash and will require a small little fenced in area to go potty outside. She travels beautifully in a crate and enjoys joining you in the car. And even though she's a senior, she never misses a peep about playtime. Nothing like a romp with a buddy to keep a pup young. She loves to play fetch with her favorite piggy toys. \n\nOnce she hears all about your love for her, she will be a fun companion who listens keenly for your every footfall.",

Harvey\u2019s original family was located but told the young Mom they didn\u2019t want her anymore because she kept running away. She came back to Massachusetts but, unfortunately after a few months was too much for the resident older female dog in the home. It was very hard for this family to give Harvey up \u2014they loved her very much especially the younger 5 year old child but, knew their first priority was their own older female dog. Harvey is shy and a bit timid when you first meet her but, warms up quickly. She\u2019s a ball of energy and is being fostered by a family with a young teenage boy. They have become best friends! She is absolutely adorable with a very sweet personality \u2014 a dog that definitely wants to please her people.\n\nHer foster home has been working with a trainer on her obedience training. Harvey tends to be timid when she is meeting other people and other dogs.  They are working on polite greeting behavior \u2014like many puppies her age she will sometime jump up to greet people. She does not typically bark at other dogs when she is on walks or when they pass her house.  Her foster family has been also taking her to doggy day care a few times a week for playtime and socialization where she gets along very well with the other pups. Harvey is adorable!  She is sweet, smart, and very active!  She would do well in a home with a family that will continue to work on her training and have time for lots of walks and play.\n",

            "description": "Looks like: Chihuahua Terrier\nMale, 10 years old, 13 pounds\n\nPupperoni is a wiggly and spunky little boy who is very excited to meet his forever people! He loves people and other dogs and shows his excitement by jumping around to let you know he's ready to make a new friend. Once that excitement has passed, Pupperoni is a pretty mellow guy. He enjoys short walks and is a bit slow, but with encouragement excels! He is polite around other dogs, sniffing them to say hello. Pupperoni does not mind being alone and uses that time to take refreshing naps. He loves to chew and his favorite toys are scented bone-shaped ones that let him indulge in chewing as much as possible. \n\nPupperoni enjoys being in the company of his person and will wake out of a deep sleep if his person leaves the room. He will sit in your lap if you sit on the floor with him and gives you little endearing finger kisses that will melt your heart. \n\nPupperoni came to with little bumps all over his body that turn out to be caused by a virus called canine viral papillomatosis. He is currently being treated with an antiviral therapy, and this should resolve by mid-January or earlier. Until the lesions clear up, Pupperoni is contagious to other dogs. Once his lesions are resolved, he will no longer be contagious and he should have lifelong immunity to the virus. This virus is not contagious to people. \n\nPupperoni is a good-natured boy, but if you accidentally touch a sore spot, he does nip a little and lets you know that is not a good place for him to be touched. \n\nPupperoni has a heart of gold and is a low maintenance, loving dog who is ready to find his forever home! \n\nPupperoni came to us from San Jose Animal Care and Services..",

In a fenced yard, she might fence fight.\n\nShe can okay with other dogs but it would need to be a like size laid back male in the home. No cats for her.

Positive reinforcement training and lots of mental and physical exercises will help tailor this handsome boy into the perfect companion for a home who'd like him to be the center of their universe.

I know Emma is really cute but she is a lot more then cute...she has a lot of baggage and here is a list of requirements for her adoption if you do not fall into all of these categories please do NOT reach out....we take our adoptions very seriously and will only set Emma up for success!\nPlease go over the list before you proceed:\n*House with fenced yard ONLY no apartments etc\n*NO OTHER ANIMALS NONE ZERO \n*Must have a lot of experience with dogs, many dogs \n*Must know how to train a dog and be committed to taking to a qualified trainer for classes, a trainer like John Sparks at www.sparksk9.com a serious trainer that can actually help you with Emma\n\nIf you can say yes to the 4 requirements please read on and I look forward to working with you and finding Emma's forever home!!!!\n\nEmma is a purebred horsecoat 5 year old Chinese Shar Pei.    She found herself very neglected the past couple of years until finally her owner surrendered her so she could find a forever home that could treat her properly like a Lil Princess.\n\nEmma is on the small side weighed in at 30 pounds but should be closer to 40 pounds max......she missed many meals as her owner forgot she existed most days.  She is great in the car and did well at the vet.  She is very food motivated so she persuades easily with a treat!\n\nShe is crate trained and is okay on a leash.  She is dying for affection.  She has beautiful eyes and coat so no allergies or entropion needed.  She is not cat friendly or dog friendly.  She needs a very dog savvy dog experienced person that is willing to take the time to train her so she finally has direction in her life.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Miss Emma you will NOT find her or any MEOW dog at our cat shelter.  ALL Meow dogs are located in foster homes.  Please email Kelly at K9WRINKLES@AOL.COM   She can provide you with an application....after approval a home visit is set up.  Adoption fee is $175.00.\nThank you for looking to adopt not shop!",

He is fully potty trained and is brilliant at 'sit', 'paw', 'wait' and 'leave it'. He absolutely loves going for hikes, but is also easily entertained with a chew toy. Hambone is a gentlemen and respectful of your home and house rules. He even enjoys a bath in the back yard!Hambone is also a fitness maven who loves to leap, jump, and run. If you like to be active in your backyard, Hambone is right there with you. He's flexible though and will be a couch potato if that's what you need. Hambone loves people and enjoys snuggling and belly rubs. He's great with older kids, but is still working on his manners with other dogs and would prefer to be your one and only pet.If you are interested in meeting Hambone, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

He loves people and does well in his doggy play group. He is crate and house trained. He rides well in the car. He doesn't seem too concerned about the cats. We would not recommend small children since he is still learning not to jump on the humans. He can be a bit bossy with other male dogs his age but is fine with females. He will need someone confident in setting boundaries with him if he is placed in a home with a male dog. He's a happy puppy would love a home to give him lots of attention. He will require a 6ft+ privacy fence.",

            "description": "These pictures do not do beautiful 4 year old Chanel justice, because she is so pretty! Chanel was owned but surrendered by her owner to a shelter in Texas. She sat there since early July, and we rescued her in September along with a dozen dogs from our Texas shelter partners. \nShe is quiet and shy, more shy with men initially, but so friendly. She really blossoms after a minute of baby talk, and her tail wags so fast it is so adorable. \nHer foster mom recently had her brother and a male friend over and at first here was about 5 minutes of barking, then treats, followed by tail wags and peace!\n\nShe loves to offer you her paws and give kisses. She also really likes to play fetch with squeaky toys! Chanel walks great on a leash and is not dog reactive at all, she pays them no mind or is friendly. She definitely wants to chase squirrels, though! However even that desire has subsided as she has grown more relaxed in her foster home. \n\nChanel has been lucky enough to score a lovely foster home where she is enjoying lounging, quiet walks, and lots of love. \n\nHer foster mom writes, \"Miss Chanel loves bully sticks, squeaky toys, playing fetch, and lots and lots of treats! She also loves walks and seems very interested in the squirrels when she sees them. Her favorite thing to do is to sleep before she gets the zoomies and bounces from couch to couch. Getting her belly scratched is her favorite thing and she'll even put her one paw on you to tell you to continue. \n\nChanel doesn't like loud noises so would do best in a quiet home in a quiet neighborhood. \n\nChanel is housebroken, but likes to be on a schedule. She likes routine! She is also very sensitive to loud noises so if there is a lot going on outside she won't relax enough to go potty on her walks. When she goes some place new she will need reassurance that outside is ok and nothing will hurt her, and this will come in time just as it has for us. Since we have had her quite a few weeks she is so much better. She is really coming into her own and is the most loving dog, she is such a delight. \n\nChanel does not have any separation anxiety. Chanel has free roam of the house and every time we've returned the house looks just the same as we had left it. She's actually usually sleeping when we get home!\n\nChanel is a shy and quiet girl until something startles her, and then she'll get a bit barky so needs to be calmed down. Since she's so timid, it's sometimes hard to introduce her to new people, as she is so scared, especially with men. However, after a proper introduction she does great. Within minutes of baby talk and treats she is giving kisses,\n\nBut overall, even with her quirks, she really is the best dog.\"\n\nNot every dog is just dumb and happy all the time, and the dogs who have quirkier personalities like Chanel deserve a home as well, because they make great and loyal companions!\n\nHer fosters would love to tell you more about this pretty girl, so please consider doing an application today if you have a quiet home, outside of the city, and love and patience to give.\n\nChanel is Heartworm positive but her case is very mild, so we are treating it using the slow kill method. Chanel will continue to have a normal quality of life throughout her treatment and we will treat her until she tests negative. Heartworm is not contagious to dogs or people, and it is preventable, and it is also curable. We treat at no cost to an adopter, they just come in once every two months to pick up medication. \n\nPlease do not let this deter you from considering this mellow, beautiful pink-spotted marshmallow of a dog! She is so deserving of a forever home! \n\nChanel's adoption fee has been generously sponsored too! Please apply today!",

Children 6 years old and older recommended due to his size.\nOscar is energetic, but will calm down and snuggle with you. Loves to go on walks. This sweet boy would love a family/individual who is active, and would take him on long walks, hiking, etc. Oscar would make a great running partner!!\nA big yard to play ball or run around in, would definitely be a plus. He loves to be loved, and definitely enjoys his treats.  \nOscar has had training and does well on commands and walking when directed. He knows how to sit when told, shake and give high 5! Don't miss out on this adorable sweet guy!! He's looking for his Christmas miracle!!!????\n\n* If interested in fostering or adopting Oscar, please contact Maggie Lu's Safe Haven Rescue.\n",

He is such a wonderful dog but he was on the euthanasia list in a highkill shelter, and we couldn't let his journey be over, and came today his rescue! \nPrecious Journey is about 6 yrs old, who is the sweetest most chillest husky around.  He always has his tongue sticking out, super cute and adorable! Journey has a friendly and mellow demeanor!  Unfortunately, we noticed the sweet has limited vision, so we took him to the vet and found out he has cataract in both his eyes, needs surgery. And the cataract test and surgery will cost around $6000! The good news is that he has 80% chance to have his vision back to normal after the surgery! We\u2019re doing everything we can to raise funds for Journey\u2019s surgery, so he can see well again! If you would like to contribute to his surgery, here\u2019s the link: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/2271404646451681/posts/2791376984454442/?d=n\n\nThis super chill boy not only deserves to have his vision back, but also to have his journey continue into an amazing home to call his own with lots of love!! He's waiting to meet you!  He's all vaccinated,  chipped and neutered.",

My name is Kai, and I have been victorious in healing from a medical condition that nearly cost me my life. I got into something that I wasn\u2019t supposed to eat and it caused an obstruction inside. I was getting sick, but it wasn\u2019t understood why. When I went to the vet, it was discovered that I had a bowel obstruction and would need surgery to release it. I had the surgery, and after my recovery time, I am ready to go! I am 1 yr and 8 months old, and I am just the happiest little man on the planet! I see the joy in a second chance at life. I love being around other dogs, I have no issues with cats, and I am learning to be calm around kids because I truly am still just a puppy. I absolutely love going on walks, and I do great on a leash. I will play fetch in the yard, but I\u2019m not too keen on bringing the ball back. I don\u2019t want to do all the work you know. Due to being a puppy, I am still a bit mouthy, but we are working on that, and I am getting the hang of it. I don\u2019t bark, and I am house and crate trained. I love chewing on my bones and playing with my toys, and I am not aggressive with them. I am going to need someone that is firm, yet loving, because I am still learning the ropes of being a puppy, so I still have some teaching and learning that needs to be done. I am a puppy in a bigger boy body, but I am sweet as can be. I am looking for my forever home, and I am hoping that it could be you!! I want to continue to be victorious, and I think that you could be my perfect match, so if you feel the same, please head over and fill out an application to take me home!! Until I hear from you, I am going to work on this whole fetch thing because apparently it\u2019s my job to bring the ball back when it\u2019s thrown; who knew. Love, Kai (UPDATED 01/20/21",

            "description": "Thibodeaux is forever home ready and CANNOT WAIT!\nThibodeaux is a lab mix born in May 2020 and is currently around 35 pounds. He will be large fully grown; around 60-70 pounds. \nHe was the baby of two dumped dogs who had a quick fling and made a cute lil thing!\nThibodeaux is all puppy, he loves playing with any new friends and thinks everyone is his best friend. It takes him a day or so to warm up to people as he had a more isolated start, but with more socialization and experiences his confidence will continue to grow. He absolutely LOVES giving kisses to his friends and loves his belly rubbed. He has so much potential as the smart boy he is, and he is ready to please! \nWith the cutest pink nose, golden eyes and chestnut fur on the tips of his ears, how can you say no?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about are animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (1 application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

I absolutely love affection, belly scratches, neck scratches - you name it and I\u2019m game. I\u2019m also game for outdoor activities. There are some really great parks in the local area that I\u2019ve visited with some of the great volunteers at PAC. I enjoy taking in all the sites, smells and trails, so I can go for a couple of miles if you\u2019re up for it!\n\nWhen not out on trails, I\u2019m interested in mental stimulation too if you have a puzzle mat I can play with! I\u2019m young \u2013 only around 11 months old \u2013 so my positive energy needs multiple avenues to explore. Even though I\u2019m young, I\u2019m already pretty good with this whole potty-training thing. I know, right? I pat myself on the back for that one!\n\nEven though I\u2019ll miss the lovely staff and volunteers, I\u2019m ready to have a family of my own! I could likely live with the right doggy pal, and I would do best in a cat-free home with kiddos 10 years or older. Hmmm, maybe I like their toys too much. Anyway, are you ready for me to join your family? Just go here (https://providenceac.org/AdoptADog) and set up an appointment to meet me! I\u2019m in one of the first kennels, so you can\u2019t miss me. I\u2019m the one with the big pointy ears and beautiful caramel colored coat...and there's a good chance I'll be reaching out to hold your hand, too.\n\nXO Ru Paw\n\nP.S. I'm all set to move-in - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nP.S.S.

Im fully potty and crate trained, I walk well on the leash, and I know fun tricks like sit, shake, high five, and lay down. \n\nI absolutely love to play with other dogs and would like a forever home with a play buddy for me. I\u2019ve unfortunately not been around cats yet, so I\u2019m not sure if I like them or not. \n\nMy ideal family would have no children around and not too many frequent visitors as meeting new people makes me pretty anxious, but I am working on it and getting better every day. I\u2019d love a family that is patient and understanding of my unknown past trauma that has made meeting new humans a fearful experience initially. My foster parents have been working on new techniques with me to feel more comfortable meeting people and it has helped a lot. I\u2019ve made a lot more human friends than I ever thought I\u2019d like and I\u2019m now ready to meet my furever family. \n\nI do require a home with a fully fenced in yard and would not do well in a condo/apartment. \n\nIf you would like to meet me, please fill out an application at www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

He is affectionate and smart, playful and endearing. He loves other dogs and will benefit from having a canine buddy as a role model for him. He's eager to please and adores his humans. Yes, he is also good with\u00a0children! And because Oliver loves to run freely and play, a six-foot privacy fence will be a \"must have\" for him. Oliver does have separation anxiety if left alone in a crate so his ideal home would be an environment where someone can be with him as much as possible and who has another dog to\u00a0keep him company. Oliver is housebroken as long as he is not confined in a crate. Oliver promises to shower his future owner with love and affection and he will make an excellent pet for anyone who can reciprocate and offer him time and patience to adjust. If you are interested in meeting or adopting Oliver, please email adoptsch@gmail.com or call 703-864-0214.\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/2ndChanceHabitat/",

            "description": "Midna is a 4 year old female Lab/pointer mix, about 45 pounds. She is energetic girl that needs lots of exercise and structure. She seems to do well with non reactive dogs her size but can get hyper around reactive dogs. NO SMALL DOGS as her prey drive is solid. Needs leash work and manners but is super sweet and loyal. Good with people but would knock down a kid under 10 years with her exuberance. Her foster mom is a runner and Midna really thrives with that kind of exercise. Owner surrender.\n\nAdoption contract and fee applies. All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events . Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums. All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes. APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page. Notice: We do not ship dogs out of state. If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit. If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS FOR MIDNA:\n\nONLY DOG IN HOME.\nNO CATS.\nCHILDREN OVER 10 YEARS OLD.\nNEEDS A 6' SOLID FENCE.\nNEEDS EXPERIENCE WITH REACTIVE DOGS OR WILLINGNESS TO LEARN AND TRAIN ACCORDINGLY.\nNEEDS AN ACTIVE HOME/ENRICHMENT.\nNO DOG PARKS OR WALKS IN HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS.\nNEEDS WALKS OR RUNS IN EARLY MORNING OR LATE EVENINGS/QUIET HIKES.",

            "description": "Meet Frisco! Frisco is one of about 50 dogs rescued from a neglectful hoarding situation in South Georgia back in early July. Some of the dogs on the property had been living inside and were more socialized, able to be adopted quickly. But sadly, there was another group that had lived their whole lives outside with little human interaction. It has taken a couple of months of living in a foster home for them to start realizing that there are good people in this world who will love and cherish them. These dogs have come amazingly far since being rescued but do still carry the weight of their previous life with them. As such, they have very specific adoption requirements listed below. Please understand, we have taken 3 months to get to know these dogs and what they need to succeed. The adoption requirements are not arbitrary but are what is needed for them to lead happy, healthy lives and as such no exceptions to these requirements will be allowed. \n\n \n\nFrisco is about a year and a half old and under 25 lbs. Hes a sweet, playful boy but still a bit on the shy side. He needs a patient adopter who is going to give him the time and space he needs to adjust and get comfortable in a new home. Given that the best teachers for dogs lacking confidence are other dogs, Frisco also must have other confident dogs in the home with at least one of them being under 30 lbs and playful. He is learning to walk on a leash but has yet to gain enough confidence to go to the bathroom on leash and does require a SECURELY fenced yard - solid wood privacy fence only (minimum 6 ft); chain link, wrought iron, or other types of fencing are not sufficient. Lastly, given that Frisco is still learning to trust people, he will not do well with the unpredictable nature of children. He is still somewhat fearful of men but could possibly learn to trust a quiet, patient man in the home if his primary caretaker is a woman \n\n \n\nWe do understand that the above requirements greatly narrows the pool of potential adopters and may even scare some people away. Frisco is most definitely a work in progress but we cannot even begin to explain how rewarding it is to watch the transformation of a dog like this who has never known love before. Once they learn to love and trust, they are so very very grateful and the amount of love they have to give and their loyalty knows no bounds. If you are interested in becoming part of Friscos continuing story, email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org",

Thankfully we were brought to Furry Friendzy where I and all my puppies have gotten the medical attention plus now we have food, water, shelter and loving hands to take care of us. I am housebroken, in a foster home, playful, sweet and look forward to having my Furever Family to share my heart.\n\nOur Furry Friendz are available for adoption through a screening process which includes but is not limited to: a completed application, 3 referrals, a home visit, and a vet referral prior to their furever home placement. The dogs are Spayed/Neutered, micro chipped, current on all vaccines and on heart worm/flea preventive. If you're interested in adopting, let's begin the Adoption process by clicking the link below.\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FURF/Dog",

            "description": "6mo. old. Sweet boy. \n\nHere is a bio from his previous home:\n\n\"The best way to describe Crosby is to tell you about a day in his life.\n\nIn the morning, we go out a greet the two of them in their enclosed area. Of course, both are happy to see us. They go out in our backyard to take care of business and then return to the house. Crosby\u2019s morning routine is to climb up, with assistance, into my lap and get his morning hugs and kisses. He loves this time and enjoys every moment of this. They will have breakfast and then it\u2019s off to our morning walk. We have found walking them separately has worked best. I walk Crosby. He loves his walks.\u00a0 He\u2019s still learning to manage himself during our walk. At times, he will bark at other people or dogs as we walk by. Some walks he does great other times he needs a little help to get through it. I\u2019ve found if I keep moving forward with him, he will move on to the next thing. After our walk, he will come back home and play with his toys or brother (when things weren\u2019t as intense) and then settle in for a morning nap. He will at times go off and find his own space and snuggle in. At other times, he\u2019ll want to snuggle with someone while he sleeps. \n\nAfter his nap, he usually likes to head outside. It nice that we have a dog door in our screened in pool, so when he wakes he can go out on his own. If the sliding doors are closed he\u2019ll paw at the door and let us know he wants to go out. He loves getting attention playing with one of his toys or will run around the backyard. After a light lunch, it is usually back to sleep for another nap. We he gets up it\u2019s time for our afternoon walk and more play. This will continue until dinner time. After dinner it\u2019s sleeping time (this is when he really likes to snuggle). He gets up and times plays a little bit, heads out to take care of business, and then come in for a night\u2019s sleep.\n\nCrosby is a handsome dog (people will comment about him on walks). He gets really excited when people come to the house. We are working on his level of excitement (staying down instead of jumping up). Of the two of them, he is more intimated by his brother. At times, we have to coax him in from outside when his brother, Nash, stands out on the deck. We will be in between the two of them and walk in with Crosby. \n\n\u00a0More Info:\n\nCrosby loves to love you, kisses abundant ! Always wanting to sit/lie on or with you to watch tv- or nap.\u00a0 He loves your company but also can be independent as he likes to nap when your busy and will enjoys stretching out. \u00a0Remember he is a puppy and loves to chew!\n\u00a0\nHas learned to sit and wait before eating kibble.\u00a0 He takes a prompt from being given a handful of kibble and then will proceed to eat on his own. \n\nEnjoys playing with you using his toys for tug of war, \u00a0or having gentle ball play, and greeting people!\u00a0\u00a0 He is friendly and likes to talk often barking or making stretch noises to communicate what he wants or giving thanks.\n\nAlthough he enjoys walks, he can be lay back and just hangout.\u00a0 Two of his favor treats are large carrots and medium size dream bones!\n\nCrosby learns best with repetition and treats for performing the right behavior.\u00a0 He is learning more each day on short walks with treats for good behavior.\n\nWe will bring all paper work from the Vet for Crosby with us, as well as his favorite things. We are heartbroken but feel it\u2019s best for him. He\u2019s a handsome boy and very loving which should make him very attractive to potential families. If you need more pictures let me know and I can forward them to you.\n\n\nFee is 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD INFO:\n\n8wks old. 1 of 2. Very lively and friendly! Very cute!!\n\n\nFee is 350 (inc. neuter)\n\nSTEP 1: SUBMIT AN APPLICATION",

She loves to talk to you and she will dunk her entire nose in her water bowl if it\u2019s deep enough. She is kennel trained and does very well on a leash. She is left loose in her foster home and does great. Her one bad deed is defurring tennis balls. She loves tennis balls!\n\nIf you would like to meet or adopt Stormy please visit our website and fill out an adoption application www.shannonfarmz.org",

He is a handsome, powerfully built, playful canine who shares lots of smiles with his human friends. When Aggie decided to take a break, he hopped into the \u201cdoggie pool\u201d and put his head under water in search of an occasionally mis-tossed treat. Aggie has been working with a Humane Society volunteer and will now repeatedly perform a sit on request and is being taught to remain in that position till released. He is still a puppy (a rather large one) at heart and has some work to do on developing better manners. One of his current talents is the innate ability to make you feel comfortably protected and secure. As are most Rottweiler\u2019s, he is confident and courageous with a self-assured persona. He confided to the photographer that despite his name, he is in reality a true fan of the Razorbacks. He also shared that he isn\u2019t overly impressed with a certain A & M Collie mascot. As you would expect, Aggie\u2019s mascot role model is none other than Tusk V.  \n\n",

            "description": "Sue, was surrendered to a local vets office. After spending quite some time waiting for the right family, we offered our assistance. \nSuki is a 3 year old, healthy American Bulldog mix. She loves people and needs a calm home with an experienced owner. She gets along well with others but does have some food aggression therefore food and treats should be closely monitored. \n\n American Bulldogs are known for being loyal, inquisitive dogs with outgoing personalities and affectionate dispositions. Suki is a sweet girl and a survivor. She was deprived of the training she needed as a pup. \n She is ready for a person or entire family to love. In foster care, Suki is decompressing and learning she deserves to be comfortable.  Suki is housebroken, intelligent, and loves opportunities to be \noutside with her people. She has been around teenage boys and lots of women . \nCats could be questionable. . She has been wonderful with a male dog but will not tolerate anyone close to her food . \n\nIf you are a match for Suki and interested in giving her a forever home, email RescueHeartsAlabama@gmail.com for more information. Fenced yard and vet information is required .",

He is a 90 pound, clumsy guy that does not need to be crated. Does well on the leash for walks, knows basic commands and is a cuddle king! Moo would do best in a home without other animals, he tends to be a bit more interested in cats then they like.. 10 + for kids due to his size. When he gets excited his face turns pink like a piggy! He is a sensitive guy and is very in tune with his people. This guy loves the car, every person he meets and is good in the bath too. He loves to be close to his people. Not to mention how adorable he is! He will need a dog savvy parent. Needs a fenced in yard! Neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped.\n?APPLICATION TO MEET MOO: WWW.MISFITANGELSRESCUE.ORG ??",

Mac's contact information is below.\n\nMcDougal (Mac) is a big (90 pounds) handsome, fun, happy, energetic and extremely loving boy.  Mac loves to play fetch and get belly rubs.  Mac was found as a stray at 4 months of age and has spent his entire life at a rural shelter.  He's never had a chance to learn about living in the real world till now.  Mac is crate trained and house trained.  He would do best in a home with a fenced yard (did we mention the boy LOVES fetch) and due to his size and exuberance - free of small children.   Mac and his adopter will benefit from continuing in his training and will receive free ongoing support for 6 months from adoption.!!!!!!    Your reward for this commitment will be one of the MOST LOVING, FUN dogs ever!  \n\nVisit Mac\u2019s Facebook Page:  (https://www.facebook.com/110406950568871/posts/178083050467927/) to see his popularity with many followers and view many, many photos showing his AWESOMENESS!\n\nIf you are interested in McDougal, email highland726@gmail.com or phone 727-642-8937.",

            "description": "Buddy came to our rescue because his former owner decided to dump him at a gas station. He didn't take him to the shelter or make an effort to rehome him, but rather opened the car door and set him loose in a high traffic area. A good samaritan was at the gas station that day and, fortunately for Buddy, she made sure he could experience the better side of humanity that day. She brought him home and started asking for help, which is how Buddy ended up with us.\n\nAccording to this good sam, Buddy didn't actually have a name. The owner dumping him had never bothered to give him one, which is surprising when you consider that he's totally potty trained and crate trained, well-socialized, and a year old. Buddy is incredibly loving, dog and kid friendly, and one of the easiest fosters we've had. He would not be a good friend to cats in the home and he needs a 6 foot fence (the boy can jump!). Applications without physical fences cannot be considered.\n\nBeing dumped was ultimately the best thing that could have happened to Buddy. He has gone from nameless and abandoned to loved and ready for a family that will adore him. And it's so easy to do. He lives with his best friend and wrestle-buddy, Odin, who is also available for adoption through RESCUEDohio (check out his page if you're interested in adopting both!). Buddy would do best with a doggie playmate. He would do best in a home with a family who can continue to introduce him to people by practicing his calm \"sit\" and re-directing him when he jumps due to excitement. He loves people.\n\nBuddy is most likely a lab/hound mix and estimated at 6 months to 1 year old. He is around 70lbs. If you're an approved applicant and would like to meet Buddy, please email your adoption coordinator or info@rescuedohio.org. To become an adopter, please apply at rescuedohio.org. Buddy's adoption fee is $300.",

Once he lets you into his circle of friends, he will wiggle when he sees you. He loves to give doggie hugs. No children. No pets in the home. May play with some dogs outside of the home.",

He was such a happy guy to have some entertainment today in his kennel with a new toy\n\n:)\n\nWinston is good with some dogs, but intolerant of others. He will need a proper dog intro, to determine if he can be adopted into a home with another dog.\nWinston is not good with kids, so he will need to be in a home with no children, or older children (teens, no one under 10).\n\nHe is already housebroken and is a happy-go lucky boy! He loves his toys and carries them everywhere! Winston has the cutest quirk of carrying his food bowl everywhere with him!\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or email info@underdogaz.com",

She is two years old and weighs 63 lbs. \n\nShe comes off a little stuck up - she pays attention to you if she wants to and if she doesn't she is excellent at ignoring you.  When she wants your attention she is very sweet.  She definitely has a mind of her own.She is housebroken and good with male dogs.  We have no cat informaton on her.  We do not recommend her with small children.\n\nWe can warn you that she does not like a crate - she destroyed one on her tirp home from the vet's office with total ease.  She also is very smart and figured out how to use a chair in the exercise yard to clear our 6' fence.  She can't jump a 6' fence but give her the aid of a chair and she is over it with ease.\n\nShe won't be able to start looking for a forever home until probably the end of January - she has been diagnosed with Hip Dysplasia in both hips and surgeries are scheduled.\n\nShe is spayed, current on shots and has been heartworm treated.  She is current on her preventatives.  If you are the pack leader this girl needs please go to our website and complete an adoption application - www.patriotsforpets.com   visitors are only allowed with pre-approved applications.  Her adoption fee will be $250.00.",

While he enjoys getting out and about he is just as happy spending his time indoors with his friends acting as your couch cushion. Despite his age his puppy behavior does come out during high excitement and he may pull and jump, so he is working on his impulse control to help him improve these behaviors. He enjoys being around other dogs but is not particularly playful with them and would prefer to spend play time with people. This large, handsome lovebug is ready and waiting for a forever home!

Please give us a call if you questions about a pet or complete an application at https://adoptmountainpets.org/pet-services/adoption-process/application-form to make arrangements to visit the Animal Resource Center.\n\nPeach is a very unfortunate  story as are many of our dogs right now.  It may be early to post her she has been here at the shelter for a very very long time and we want to at least begin to introduce them to idea of finding the loving family she deserves.  \nWhen Peach came to us she could not be touched, did not know what a leash was and was terrified to be inside. \n Both have made tremendous progress and Peach will now walk on leash with her favorite people and approach slowly and take treats.    She ahs never been anything but sweet but is just so shy. \nWe know opening your home to girl like Peach is a big ask and long shot but we are not going to give up on her... She is very loving once she gets used to you! She loves to run around and play with other dogs!  We are hoping for a home with another more confident dog for Peach to follow around. \nPeach will likely never be an off leash dog and will be best in home with a fenced yard.  \n\n\nAdopters will be considered on the totality of the application and how it matches the particular pet's needs.\n\n\nMost dogs who come from the shelter will not be house trained.\n\nWe do not know or make guarantees that a dog or cat will do well with all children, other animals or is house-trained.\n\nWe will need to talk to all of the adults in the home prior to making an appointment to visit with a pet. \n\nIn most cases its necessary to to have family dogs come into meet your potential adoptee. Please be sure your dogs are spayed or neutered and current on vaccines (distemper - parvo and rabies) before bringing them for a meeting.\n\nAll dogs must be transported home in a travel crate to transport your new pup home safely.\n\nRenters must provide a copy of a lease indicating pets are allowed or contact information for the landlord.\n\n\nSecond Chance is happy to have been providing stray, surrender, adoption, and our Community Outreach services throughout the COVID situation.   \n\nAll services are provided by appointment only.  Please do not visit the shelter without first making calling the shelter. \n\nFor the safety of our community, staff and volunteers all visitors are required to wear masks and follow the posted social distancing processes *see below.  Do not make an appointment if you are not comfortable following these procedures.  Thank you for understanding and your support.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting one of our pets or have questions about the process please see our website at www.adoptmountainpets.org or call the Shelter between 11:00 am and 5:45 pm Tuesday through Saturday. 970 626 2273\n\n*  We want to provide you excellent customer service today and keep you and our team safe and healthy. Please read what we are asking you to do today to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other people. Six feet is the average length of many dog leashes but handing a leashes to another person is not maintaining a six foot space.\n\u2022 Follow staff instructions about how to drop off, pick up or meet a pet.\n\u2022 If you have any symptoms of illness please reschedule.\n\u2022 Wear a mask when interacting with staff\n\u2022 Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer (you can find bottles throughout the property prior to interacting with staff, volunteers or pets.\n\u2022 Once you have read these guidelines, please tell us you understand them and that you will follow them with at SCHS.\nThank you for your support, for adopting, for fostering and volunteering and understanding our need to do our part in stopping COVID \u2013 19.",

BABY was found in a deep, watery ditch guarding an old pizza box that she had already licked down to the cardboard!\nBaby is just that... a young, sweet, innocent little girl who needs a good home with lots of love and play to share!  She is about 2 years old, weighs approx 50 pounds and has been fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped!  She tested heartworm-Negative and has been receiving regular heartworm prevention.  Baby is both crate and house-trained!  She does not enjoy stormy weather, but she doesn't pace or drool.  She just gets in a close, tight space and waits for it to pass.  She has her own Thundershirt in bright pink, and she happily stands still while you put it on her.  She knows it makes her feel better.  ?\nThis sweetheart is a happy, energetic little girl who loves to ride in the car, play fetch, and is a pro at catching a single kibble in the air!   She hasn't been tested with cats, but by the way she stalks and chases squirrels, I wouldn't risk it.  But, there is No exaggeration when I say that this little Pit is a total lover!  If you think you would like to spend a bunch of years having fun and cuddling with this little girl, please apply for her today!

At two years old he is still very puppy like and will collect and play with toys, especially ones that squeak. He is very energetic and will run through the house skidding on throw rugs or turn laps in the back yard. Toys and shoes will be collected, but he has not chewed up anything. He is on the vocal end of the spectrum for a greyhound and will bark quite easily, and tends to whine if he is shut out of the room his people are in. A good bond will be formed with his family, but he is fearful of new people. However, he will warm up and trust them if they are nice to him. He walks well on a lead, rides well in a car, and found out he loves camping. Santa is an energetic puppy like boy who is a little skittish but loves his people.\n",

She is house trained, crate trained, and ready to play with a furry sibling!  \n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an adoption and you live in Texas , please complete the application (links provided below). The process includes a vet check, calling references and doing a home visit. \n\nhttp://www.texassleddogrescue.org/web_documents/tsdr_application.pdf\nor\nhttps://www.formstack.com/forms/?1632205-WX2Zb144ZP\n\nPlease note the following:\nWe rarely do out of state adoptions.  (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience and will require same adoption process.)\nChildren in the home or that visit often must be at least 6 years of age. (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience.)\nAdoption donation is due at the time of adoption.  Puppies under 1 year are $300. Dogs 1 year to 7 years are $200 and dogs over 7 years are $150.  As this is a donation, it will be non-returnable if dog is returned to rescue.\nDogs are not placed on a \"first come, first serve\" basis but rather the best home for the dog. \nAll dogs placed by TSDR will be:\nspayed/neutered\nvaccinated for distemper/parvo, rabies, and bordetella\nheartworm tested and treated if needed\nmicrochipped\nother vetting as deemed needed\nNew owners will receive copies of all available vet information and must agree to keep them current on all of the above.",

            "description": "Yoda, I am! And the Force is definitely strong with me. I've been through some tough times, but TLP and my foster mom never gave up. Now I'm stronger and healthier than ever, and ready to find my forever home, I am!\n\nWhen I say I love to be with people, I mean I looooove to be with people. I especially enjoy short walks (I get SO excited about walks) and long car rides! My favorite spot is right by the door or window, where I can watch all the goings-on of the neighborhood. \n\nI'm dog-friendly, too! I'm a big guy and I take playing seriously. Just make sure to watch me so I don't overdo it! I haven't been around cats, but I am totally unmoved to chase squirrels and other critters in the yard. That's too much energy for me!! I'd rather be taking a nap or chomping on my toys.\n\nSince I came to TLP in May, I've had a few tumors removed and knee surgeries. But now I'm recovered and ready to go! I'm going through treatment for heartworms and my cropped ears are susceptible to ear infections. TLP can talk you through my care and how to keep me in tip-top shape.\n\nI'm the happy, affectionate boy you're looking for. Just throw me in the backseat and let's ride off into the sunset. Apply to meet me now!",

He didn't seem to know what a gentle hand from a human was like and it took a while for him warm up to humans but has come such a long way. He is a sweet boy who just needs patience from his human. He walks beautifully on a leash and loves spending time outdoors. Oak is looking for someone that will give him time to decompress in a new home environment and get to know him on his terms. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Oak, please fill out an application on our website at www.azhartt.org/programs-services/adoptions",

If you would like to meet Ivy please submit an application on CodysFriendsRescue.com She has completed 30 days of training and ready to roll! Ivy is looking for an energetic home filled with love, goodness, and friendship. She is ready and raring for activities that keep her mind and body active.

            "description": "This is our girl Sabrina.  Sabrina was running stray,  Several people were monitoring her whereabouts. They would have a sighting and attempt to get close to her or call her and try tempting her with food, but were always in the end greeted with a growl, snarl, and a hasty departure. She was seen in many different locations, covering miles.  People kept seeing this large, matted, dirty dog.   A plan to use the large live trap was decided on.  The trap was set close to the last spotting.  Then came the food.  Freshly cook meat, potatoes and gravy.  Friends living close were on \"dog in the trap alert\".     In less than an hour the call came that the dog was indeed in the trap. Transported in the trap, we arrived at the shelter.  This poor animal was so  full of mats, burrs, dirt, mud, and poop,  we were unable to distinguish  ,whether male or female. We called the dog \"Ghost.\"  After a getting acquainted time, we proceeded with  treats, play, and brushing.  It got to the point that brushing was appreciated and even enjoyed. It also became apparent that Ghost was not a good name for this \"GIRL\"  We would call her Sabrina. \n\nWe are learning more about her every day.  She enjoys play time.  Her favorite is her red ball.  She is not at all fond of small dogs, so we are guessing that cats are on the same  level.  She seems to have taken a liking to one of the male shepherds  here. We want to express that Introduction is an absolute must if you have another dog.\n\nSabrina has been fully vetted, is spayed,  up to date on vaccines,  and clear  of heartworm.\nWe will be taking applications for her adoption.  If you have further questions about Sabrina or our adoption process you may e-mail us at echelon@airadv.net or you may also telephone the Thumb Animal Shelter at 989-375-4204.",

She is very timid and shy but she is making slow progress. She loves her crate and feels safe there. Zoe has a good appetite and loves treats. She is pretty much house trained and only had accidents at night. Her favorite thing in the world is going for a walk. She never strains at the leash and is very inquisitive. She is never aggressive when meeting other dogs. She has a pitbull next door , Daisy Duke who she has become very fond of! Gifts today from a secret Santa has peaked an interest in toys she probably never had before .More to come as this beautiful girl continues to come out of her shell!!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

She was an excellent mama to her babies and now it\u2019s her turn to find her furever home! CeCe has excellent house manners. Even though she\u2019s had no formal training, we think she will be quick to learn as she is eager to please and so sweet. CeCe is a bit timid in new situations and a little slow to warm up to people. Her favorite foods, cheese and whipped cream cheese are sure to help her learn to trust a bit quicker :) CeCe is nervous when she sees the leash but walks well with her pack. Speaking of a pack, she loves her canine companions and looks to them for guidance, so she would love a sibling in her new home to keep her company and show her the ropes. CeCe prefers to be wherever you are - inside or outside. She thumps her tail enthusiastically the minute she hears you coming and her infectious smile comes out when getting good pets! CeCe is an easy-going girl looking for the Pyrfect family to give her the love she deserves. If she sounds like your kind of girl, apply for CeCe today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Dixie Girl is waiting for some lucky person, couple, or family to adopt her.\n\nDixie did not have the best start in life. After she was rescued from a derelict house with 10 other dogs, she was finally taken in as a foster by a couple who works from home. They have four other dogs of their own.\n\nHere is what her foster \u201cmom\u201d says about Dixie.\n\n\u201cDespite having four dogs, we took her as a foster because she was not doing well in the boarding kennel. Some dogs get frustrated in a short time -- she is one.\u201d\n\n\u201cDixie isn\u2019t a cute, nervous, little pet. She is a cattle dog mix with all the best qualities of her heritage, which means she is powerful, athletic, super smart, loyal, playful, and affectionate. She is the type of dog who will be a true companion and a good buddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gets along well with all our dogs. She plays endlessly with our young male dog. At night she sometimes sleeps with our alpha dog, a large female. Dixie competes with our two extremely needy dogs for attention, but never once has shown aggression towards either of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Dixie Girl wants attention, she brings a tennis ball to me. And when I want attention, I ask Dixie to find the ball. She communicates game-on with another dog by waving the ball in their face.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe checks on me during the day by looking through the window and follows me in the yard. The highlight of her day is a walk. She is good on a leash after she calms down. She gets distracted by cats and sometimes gophers. A dog biscuit can help refocus her attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sometimes digs. She will chase cats and critters\u2026and she is fast. On the other hand, Dixie has never chewed the dog quilts or blankets -- unlike our male dog who eats and chews anything. Dixie does not bark impulsively as some dogs do.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gets very excited when she sees me. Sometimes she jumps on me\u2026sometimes just in front of me. I think this will stop once she isn\u2019t competing with four other dogs for my attention. Note: our super needy dog often gets everyone jumping. When not competing with the others, Dixie often leans slightly against my legs, which is a dog-hug.\u201d\n\n\u201cDixie is more interesting than most dogs -- she learns extremely fast and enjoys the attention. Dixie Girl is a wonderful dog who I believe, with the right home, will blossom into a truly remarkable companion.\u201d\n\nDixie is spayed, immunized, heartworm negative, and on heartworm preventative. She is full-grown and weighs about 60 lbs. She is a real sweetie pie. Interested in meeting Dixie?

Luna can be a tad shy when it comes to meeting strangers, but if you are willing to give her time and space to get used to your presence, she will soon transform into the most loving girl. In fact, when she decides to put her trust in you, not only will she wag her tail furiously, but also do a silly happy dance as she can hardly contain her happiness :) Luna enjoys chilling outdoors during the day, and she loves to take long naps in her dog bed when it is time to come inside for the evening. This beautiful girl will do well with an experienced handler who is familiar with Pyrs and their behaviors, and who will continue working with her using the positive reinforcement that she responds to, surely to bring out the best in Luna!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

About four years old, this girl arrived in our care when her owner no longer wanted her.\n\nPrecious was fostered for a couple months. Although she can be shy at first, she loves to receive lots of love and attention when she warms up. She is an especially good lapdog and will take every chance she can get to hop onto your lap so she can be close to you. Precious also likes jumping on chairs and would probably love to cuddle up on a couch if given the opportunity. \n\nPrecious is completely housetrained. She needs a securely fenced-in yard and a home without cats or other small pets.\n\nWill you provide Precious with a place to call home?

He would prefer to be the only dog. Eating snacks is his favorite past time. He has been very tolerant, while having blood drawn he hardly needed to be restrained and never stopped wagging his happy tail. All he was concerned with was the hugs and kisses he was getting from the nice lady he met.Sully is a solid 53 pounds and only around a year old. His adoption fee is $250. This includes his DA2PPv, bordetella and rabies vaccinations, dewormed, started on heartworm and flea/tick preventions, heartworm tested (negative), microchipped and neutered.Applications can be found at: http://care.rescuegroups.org",

            "description": "Meet Journey! She is an approx 3 year old, 78 pound German Shepherd. GSD breed experience will be required to adopt her. She is appropriately named after volunteers tracked this beautiful female black Shepard for over six weeks after a witness saw her tossed from a truck. Injured and terrified she ran and hid and ran and hid day after day. We make note of this because this gal will need a patient owner to reduce the flight instinct that kept her alive while she was on the run. She is housebroken and crate trained but is super agile so a six foot fenced property is required for adoption. She is affectionate and bonds tightly once she trusts you as happens with her breed. She wants a family that is home a lot to spend time with her. She is good with other dogs and takes comfort from them so will require a confident dog buddy in her forever home. She plays pretty hard so no small dogs or cats to avoid accidental injury. She is good with kids who approach appropriately...scares her when they are rushing at her so looking for a home without young kids. She would be an incredible lure coursing pup or agility dog because she is so smart and driven to please.\nJourney is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is only $250.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "Sweet little Lucas is a 1.5 year old, 12 pound, cream colored Chihuahua mix. He has a DAZZLING smile! This handsome boy is shy. He was brought to us by a good Samaritan who found Lucas & his sister Leia in her grape field on Lucas Rd. Leia was pregnant and delivered her pups 3 days after arriving in her foster home.  He will need you to be patient with him until you earn his trust. He will need  leash training and a little time to learn that car rides are fun! He loves his people time and would enjoy spending the day with you. He will sit quietly while you work from home. When he greets you he gets so happy that he JUMPS and dances with JOY. We believe he will blossom quickly in his new home. He would be fine with or without another dog in the home though he gets along great with other dogs. He is an active boy so he needs a house with a yard where he can run & play outdoors with his family.  He will need some potty training, he is learning to use the doggie door. Here at the sanctuary after breakfast & dinner we use the command \u201cGo Potty\u201d.  Lucas obeys and goes right out the door. Continue this at home and he should be potty trained quickly. Lucas has been neutered, microchipped and is current on vaccinations. Are you ready for a sweet boy to love?

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Olaf. I am almost 2 and I weigh about 42 lbs. \nI was surrendered to the pound after being found living neglectfully outside chained to a dog house. My owner claimed they put me outside because I had fleas...  \nI am unsocialized and will require a patient new family with the time to work with me on training, socialization and housebreaking. I am very sweet once I get to know you some. \nI do not do well with other dogs and will require a home where I can be the only pet. \nIf you're looking for a nice dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

Natasha hasn't had the best experience at the beginning of her life which makes her protective of herself and her surrounding. She takes a while to warm up to new people, and will growl at first when uncomfortable and unsure. Once she settles into a home, she bonds very deeply and would give her life for her person, however, she does tend to become protective of the home and her person so would need a home that is comfortable understanding that she will need to be separated when new visitors come into the home and introduced to strangers carefully and with patience. She is extremely sweet, loyal, and protective but her protectiveness sadly make her not suitable for a home with lots of visitors or family who is looking for a social dog they can take everywhere.. We know it's a long shot for Natasha to find a home, but we are hopeful that there is a wonderful family out there who will take the time to get this diamond in the ruff to warm up, fall in love, and be loyal and give their life for them for the rest of her life. Natasha cannot live in an apartment.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Dugan would probably do best in a home with another active dog to play with. He is cat friendly but gets overly excited. So would recommend a home with no kitties or older/mellow cats. Dugie loves toys and playing fetch or tug of war. Will need a big yard with a secure fence and a family who wants to exercise with him everyday. Goes right into his crate with a treat.\n\nIf interested in meeting or adopting Dugan, please fill out an app on our website at www.tgspca.org",

We\u2019ve spent the last few months helping him gain weight, get properly groomed, and learn all about freedom! \n\nMario is a sweet, sweet boy who loves all people and animals. He does well in his crate and has been working very hard on house breaking. He is still on a puppy type schedule and can only go for a few hours before having an accident, but this is improving now that he\u2019s been in a foster home that\u2019s keeping him on track. \n\nMario would do well in a home with or without other dogs, but would love dog friends if his new family doesn\u2019t already have pets. He would do well in a home with older children because he is blind and can easily knock over a small child when excited. His new family should be prepared to continue working with him on training (with our help!) and helping to keep his mind busy! \n\nHe is searching for a home within a few hours of Baltimore. \nIf you think you\u2019d be a good fit, please apply at kellerscause.com/adopt",

In fact, he doesn't want to share any attention with a male dog but would tolerate another female dog. He will need lots of exercise after having to be quiet for his heartworm treatment. He is fully vetted and ready for a new home. He is a very sweet boy who can't wait for a family of his own.\nYou can visit our website or pricing and adoption details. The first step in our adoption process is completely filling out an adoption application. We are a foster based organization and do not currently have a shelter location.\nhttps://graingercountyhumanesociety.org/available-dogs",
