            "description": "My name is \"Pumba\" and just like my ears, my life has been up and down. You see, I was living in a shelter down south, which was very sad for me. But, I'm happy to tell you my life is on the \"up\", as I was one of the lucky ones chosen to be given a chance at great life in this great state of New Hampshire!\n\nEveryone falls in love with how cute I am! Some of my favorite pastimes are snuggling on my soft blankets, playing, chasing tennis balls and I love a good chew toy! I have wonderful leash manners and everyone says I'm a joy to walk. I know some basic commands and I'm willing to learn more if you will teach me. I do love a good back & butt scratching too! In my kennel here at the shelter, I'm such a quiet, well behaved guy.\n\nI am 2 years old, 66 lbs., neutered and current on vaccinations. My ideal home would be children 12+ who will respect my space as I get used to all my new surroundings. I sometimes feel a little afraid of some people who are too quick to approach me. I just need a little time to know that everyone loves me. I am willing to meet any potential canine siblings to see if we are compatible. As for cats. I'm not sure how I feel about this things yet!\n\nWe kindly ask, if you have questions regarding Pumba, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n**************************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.

Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "Benson isn\u2019t a big boy.  He can almost qualify for what we endearingly call a pocket shepherd, almost.  Don\u2019t let his small stature fool you though.  He knows he\u2019s a German Shepherd through and through.  He is loyal to his family.  That is what made it so hard for him this year when he lost them because they could no longer afford him.  He doesn\u2019t understand how he went from a home where he had lived for all of his life to being lost in a strange place, with strange people, surrounded by so many dogs in the shelter.\n\nUnlike other dogs who have been found as strays, with Benson, we are fortunate enough to have a little history on him.  We know he loves more than anything to be with his people.  He has been known to have a little separation anxiety; so he would need a family that can help him with that, one where he isn\u2019t left alone for long periods.  He knows some of his commands, sit, down, and even paw.  He loves to chase any rope that you drag along the ground for him.   Since Benson has been with Coastal at the Ranch, he has bonded with some of the volunteers, and he is quick to let them know that he knows they are there.  Even from a distance, he sounds off with his bark to let them know he sees them.  He is underweight right now, but we are making sure he gets extra meals.  The stress of kennel life doesn\u2019t help Benson, especially when he is too stressed to eat.  We know that being in a stable home is exactly what he needs.  Benson is five years old now.  This was his first Christmas without a family.  We are hoping that he can find a family soon.\n\n.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "BELLE UPDATE!!\n\nWho remembers that scared and emaciated bully girl that was dumped a few weeks back!? Look at our girl now. TLC goes a long ways!!\n\nMeet Belle aka Willow. This girl was found dumped and starving. Willow had lived a pretty hard life before coming to us. She\u2019s only 9-12 months old and was completely terrified of humans when she first came into care. They have not been good to her so who could blame her. She was skin and bones but has filled out great over the last few weeks. Her kennel is her safe place and she willing goes in when she\u2019s told. She also sleeps in it all night without issues and eats in it. Despite all of her issues she\u2019s the sweetest thing and hasn\u2019t offered up one bit of aggression. At first she was terrified of other dogs but she has grown to love to play with others and would likely do best in a home with a playmate as we feel her 4 legged foster siblings have helped her come out of her shell. She\u2019s great with the fosters 6 year old. She has not been around cats. A home with small critters is not a good idea as she has tried to get the pet rats in her foster home. She loves to be in her fosters lap. She\u2019s still timid with new people but does open up and want to be loved on. She needs a home that will give her patience and time to settle in. It won\u2019t take long and she will be your best friend forever and we can promise you that. She\u2019s doing good on house training. She has only had a few accidents if not let out right after she eats or she drinks too much water. She\u2019s truly a great little girl. She is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and will be spayed on 1/20. \n\nAll dogs have a $150 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $100 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in its entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog a loving furever home.\n\nBeabe here!  I am a 14-year young girl who weighs 8 pounds.  Yes I am just a small thing perfect to take everywhere.  I am easy going and sweet senior citizen looking for my furever home where I can comfortably spend my senior years.\n\nI am mostly blind and going deaf but that doesn't stop me from having fun and exploring.  I am pretty low maintenance.  I am very happy to take my short walks, get a mini play session in, and relax in my bed.  If you are looking for that best friend that will give you all the unconditional love you can handle I am your girl. \n\nI can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n\nBeabe\nxoxxo\n",

Many thanks for your interest.  \n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nShelby is a lovely little 6-year-old, spayed female, Jack Russell Terrier/Chihuahua/Pittie mix.  Sadly, Shelby's owner unexpectedly passed away from covid\u2026, and she is without any other family.  Shelby therefore will need to find a new forever home.\n\nAs to be expected, she was a bit confused, and unsure about the drastic change in her living situation; however, dogs are resilient, and she is adjusting well.  She is housebroken and trustworthy in the home when left alone.  She is also crate trained if needed.  She is actually a pretty easy-going girl in the household.\n\nWhen Shelby first came into foster care after her dad passed away, she didn't have much in the way of social skills interacting with other animals \u2013 she just never had a reason to since she lived solo.  After working with her for just a very short time, she has learned and is interacting appropriately in her foster home with both her canine foster sister and resident felines. We feel that Shelby would be able to live with another dog that would match her personality type \u2013 a non-dominant/non-confrontational canine counterpart would pair best.  And dog-savvy indoor cats as she sometimes would consider chasing a kitty - but when told that is no longer appropriate, she listens very well.\n\nShelby would also be very happy to have her own person/people all to herself; so we will assess potential animal companions on a case-by-case basis - so long as the humans in the household are dog-savvy and committed to giving Shelby continued guidance :)\n\nShe is working on her leash reactivity towards other unknown dogs/cats, an area that just became a habit for her.  However, Shelby responds so very well to correction and redirection of undesirable behavior.  She is very food-motivated and, thus, when necessary, consistent correction & reward result in her being very readily redirected into more appropriate behavior.  \n\nAll in all, Shelby is a quite easy little house dog.  She is a bit chunky at 35 lbs \u2013 should be about 30 \u2013 so, she is a great, manageable size; although she can pull a bit on the leash.  She is fairly mellow indoors and happy to relax in her favorite chair.  She also enjoyed daily walks with her dad & she would love to continue that with her new family.\n\nWe feel Shelby would do best in a retirement style home, with not a lot of commotion going on; but she, of course, will also need activity to keep her healthy & mentally stimulated.  We feel she\u2019d be ok with older kids who will respect what she has been through (10+ year old kids).  \n\nShelby is such a nice little dog who got a raw deal in losing her dad when she should have been set for the rest of her days.  She will be a great companion for the right family, and we hope you will consider her.\n\n**if viewing on Petfinder be sure to check out her videos & extra photos at https://safeatlast.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=16441968**\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nAlso, if you have any additional questions. please contact foster mom Jill (swiffer109@yahoo.com)!  And, please feel free to fill out the Safe at Last adoption application if interested, and caretaker Jill will follow up with you.  \n\nShelby's adoption fee is $150 - and this includes spay, rabies vaccine, distemper vaccine, lepto vaccine, dewormer (if needed), flea treatment (if needed), heartworm/lyme test, & microchip!\n",

She was having difficulty taking care of the dogs and so decided to surrender them. Pixi has lived most of her adult life with Zack, also listed here. We are seeking a home where the pair of them can remain together for their last few years. Pixie had been with that owner for 9 years. She seems to be a very quiet calm dog who gets along with everybody. She's not overly friendly or outgoing, a bit reserved but not nippy at all. Both dogs get very nervous around small children. She has some sight and hearing loss but doesn't seem to suffer any arthritis yet. An easy walk every other  day would be more than sufficient exercise for her",

He was surrendeeed to the Humane Society in Twin Falls Idaho after his owner became homeless and was living in her car with both dogs. She was having a hard time taking care of them and so decide surrendering them would be best. She'd had him since he was 2yr old. He has lived with Pixie most of his adult life and they get along great and it would be a shame to separate them, so if at all possible a home with room for both is being sought., however it is not a requirement. He is a happy boy and likes to please. He is mostly quiet and prefers to sleep his days away. He does really like to chase cats, although i doubt he could catch one at his age. He would be up for a easy daily walk, but mostly just needs a warm fire to rest his old bones by.",

Luna prefers the company of people rather than canine friends. For this reason Luna needs to be the only dog in the home. She will also do best in a home with children ages 16 and up. Luna has lived with cats before, but does want to chase them on occassion, so slow controlled introductions to cat friends would be needed. Luna's wonderful demeanor is sure to win you over, so please call to find out how you can meet this gorgeous gal! Remember, ask for Luna!

Duke's ears were swollen shut and oozed pus and infection. He was deaf and needed surgery pretty desperately to relieve his pain. He's on the mend now and doing great in his foster home. He's good with female dogs and adores kiddos. Duke gets a bit nervous when he's alone, so a family that's around often and can include him in their comings and goings would be best. Duke is in foster in Niwot. His adoption fee is $350. REQUIREMENTS: 1. No apartments 2. No breed ban areas 3. Female resident dog (or no dogs).  You can apply for Duke at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nFreya is a bundle of energy and an extremely sweet dog who loves to hug everyone she meets. This girl is petite - full grown and weighing in at about 38 pounds - we've taken to calling her our pocket-husky. She is smart and learns very quickly, but of course has a typical husky personality and needs plenty of attention and exercise, or that little brain will find things to do She has been exceptionally good in the house and learns quickly to be respectful of places and things that aren't to be bounded upon or chewed. She settles in at night, on her bed or yours, but likes to be active during the day. Luckily she is good at entertaining herself for short periods and will keep you laughing at her antics!\n\nFreya needs an active household and possibly another dog buddy. Certainly no small dogs or cats, or cattle for that matter!\n\nFull disclosure: Freya has been diagnosed with cataracts, even at her young age. The decreased vision doesn't seem to deter her, but she has been known to bump into things and sometimes has to hunt for toys with her nose and ears, which she excels at. [Cataracts is treatable by surgery but has a long recovery process and is not recommended for her at this time due to her young age. We are continuing to monitor her to see if there is progression, or best case, the progression has stopped. This is not a painful condition like glaucoma.] Her condition does not stop her from gazing lovingly into your eyes.\n\nFreya is a real catch. Her foster mom will eventually want to adopt an older dog, otherwise she'd keep Freya, so wants to find the right, perfect home. And look at the photos - did we say she's absolutely beautiful?!!",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Gary! The first thing you might notice about me is that I am super naked at the moment! How embarrassing. I was found in a box out in the cold and it turns out that I had a problem with my skin that made all my hair fall out. A nice lady found me and now I am doing so much better. My hair is slowly growing back and I feel great! Now I am looking for my very own family.\n\nI am the best companion dog, I like to be very close to people and other dogs at all times. My favorite activity is burrowing under blankets and snuggling on the sofa! I will sit quietly in your lap while you work and I like to be carried around. My foster mom says that she loves when I get excited and do my signature dance moves before eating or playing. I have grown accustomed to wearing sweaters and jackets and I have learned how to use a step to get onto the sofa all by myself! I give kisses to my foster fur siblings, but it takes me a little while to warm up new dogs. I have to make sure they are considerate of my small stature!\n\nI don't really enjoy walks. It's just not my jam... there are loud noises, I'm not interested in smelling things, and it takes me forever to get anywhere. Pick me up please! Since I am so small, I prefer to do my business outside and then go right back inside where I can live my best indoor life.\n\nI would do best in a home where I can be around my people all day and have a yard of my own. I require frequent potty breaks and I get separation anxiety when I can't be in the same room as another dog or person. I do not do well in a crate unless you would like to get into the crate with me \n\nIf you are looking for a calm and small companion to share your day with, then I'm the one for you.\n\nGary is an 8 year old male chihuahua and weighs 5.5 lbs.",

            "description": "Toby Tobias Tobe Tobester Tobemeister He is quite the hunk in small packaging. Toby is a very, very, loving boy who enjoys lap time whenever he\u2019s not playing. He would do well in a home that wants to continue working on his confidence and providing a home full of love, patience, and positive reinforcement. This Toby boy wants nothing more than to please his humans. He does need to be fed and treated separately from other dog friends. He\u2019s very gentle but will snap at other dogs who come near his food. He is good with other dogs once he\u2019s had time to sniff. It would be best if dogs in the home were non-reactive when they first meet him. Toby deserves an owner with a soft touch as his past one was not kind to him. He is not a fan of men and he will bark at them non-stop. He is working on crate training and will cry for bit when he first goes in, but quiets down nicely. Toby enjoys playing with toys and tug-o-war with other dogs is his absolute favorite. He is polite on a leash and listens well. Due to his crying and barking when initially crated, shared walls won\u2019t be a good match for him. Toby is shacking up in Englewood. His adoption fee is $400. REQUIREMENTS: Positive reinforcement Patient home No shared walls Teenagers or older.  You can apply for Toby at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nDenning is a 1-year-old (DOB 11/18/19) cutie who came to us via a local county animal control. Like most young Dobermans we see, people underestimate how much attention a young working breed needs, so he will require an obedience commitment to ensure his success. He is always happy, so enjoy his full natural tail always wagging and pet his long, soft ears. In a temporary foster home, Denning seemed housebroken. He is very affectionate, and he loves people. He has no known history with kids, and he will likely be a big oaf and knock them over. But sturdy and resilient kids 10 and up who act respectfully around big dogs and don\u2019t mind sharing their toys can be considered. His exuberance for life may not be appreciated by older folks who are unsteady on their feet. Denning has no history with cats, and he doesn\u2019t like small dogs. He wants to play with dogs more his size. He now weighs 65 lbs, and will fill out some more. Like many Dobermans, Denning is very vocal, so he\u2019s not a good candidate for condos or townhomes. As a youngster, he has a lot of energy, so he would appreciate LONG walks or a jogging partner. A quick walk around the block to potty is not enough. He is learning not to pull, but he is catching on. He enjoys a 4-ft chainlink fence at the moment. Denning is very smart and willing to please, but he just needs some direction. He\u2019s very busy and needs a job to occupy his mind and body. His favorite toys are chewing on a Benebone or Kong or stealing a throw pillow and playing keep away.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner.

In play group, Mac mostly kept to himself, but was tolerant of other dogs greeting him. Mac has asked to have a meet-and-greet with any resident dogs before he goes home with them, just to make sure they'd be a good fit as roommates. While Mac is a bit unsure about his feelings for other dogs, he's not at all confused about his feelings for treats: He loves them. Mac would do best in a home with a secure, fenced yard and without kids, or with older kids who can understand that sometimes dogs need space. Please don't let Mac spend any more of his golden years in the shelter. If you've got some room in your home and heart for a sweet, senior looking for a soft place to rest his head, make an appointment to meet Mac today.",

Boi is housebroken, crate-trained and even better, he used to live with cats and reportedly did very well. (His former owner said he used to protect the cats in the house.)

He is slightly submissive, and does not show Alpha tendencies. He is overweight but loves walks and is very friendly and doesn't show aggression. Fuego is not super socialized, but walks well on leash and knows some commands: Leave It and Sit. His is treat motivated and eats well and doesn't seem to have any food aggression issues. He will rummage through trash if he has the opportunity.\n\nFuego has slight anxiety separation, but might just be from his being tossed from place to place and he is housebroken. He has great looking white teeth...no dental issues noticeable, loves to talk at times, so can sometimes be mouthy. At 82 lbs and exuberant he jumps up when playing, but he can be calmed down. Fuego does not seem to be an escape artist or shows signs of wanting to leave his current home.\n\nHe would definitely do well and be very happy in a Husky/Mal savvy home. Fuego - came a long way. Still mouthy but lets me touch and scratch him all over. Not a big fan of being picked up or grabbed by the collar. Fuego needs a savvy, strong, and confident owner to continue with training and someone who understands the difference between mouthy and biting.",

I had a fractured pelvis, but now I'm all better and ready to meet you! After spending three months on crate rest, I want to roam freely! I'll need some help with crate-training. I'm intelligent and observant. I taught myself how to use a puppy pad after watching my foster-sister use one! I'm loyal to my pack. I'll be at your feet when you're cooking, working, or watching tv. I have mild separation anxiety when you're gone. I'm cautious but courageous. I protect my cat sibling from the vacuum. I'll alert you when strangers are in the distance. I'm playful and energetic. I run with the big guys at the dog park. I want to play with all cats and dogs and get a little grumpy when they don't want to play with me. I enjoy tug-of-war and long walks. At home, I'm a picky eater. Outside, I forage for snacks. Please watch what I put in my mouth! I won't beg for your food, only your attention. I've never been around small children. \n\nI am potty trained. I am neutered, up-to-date on shots, heart worm tested and on preventative,and microchipped. I'd do best in a home that's committed to teaching and exercising me. \n\nMy adoption fee is $150. I can go home with you on a one-week visit!",

She will need a special diet and we are not sure if her skin condition is chronic or not yet. \n\nShe is about 4-5years old, spayed, vaccinated and negative for disease. She is dog selective and we are not sure about cats or children. At this time she should be an only pet and go with an experienced dog owner. \n\nShe is very people friendly. We are still getting to know her.  \n\nAll animals impounded at the shelter must be advertised in a local paper and held for a full seven days to ensure that the proper owner has an opportunity to claim their missing animal. After the 7 day holding period applications will be accepted for the animal and the animal will be adopted to the best qualified candidate which fits the needs of the animal.\n\nAll animals are spayed & neutered prior to going home unless veterinarian recommendation prohibits us from doing so.\n\nAdoption Fees\n\nUnaltered(Not Spayed or Neutered) Animals\n\nCats $70.00 Dogs $85.00 \n\nThis entitles the adopter to a martingale collar/leash for dogs or a safety collar for cats, microchip, discount voucher towards the spay or neuter and two free vaccinations at a participating veterinarian under the State of Connecticut's Animal Population Control Program. The animal will be dropped off at a veterinarian prior to adoption. Standard health testing will be performed in addition to the alter & vaccines. The new owner will be responsible for the balance at the veterinarian which ranges on average from $100.00-$200.00 depending on the animal.\n\nAltered (Spayed/Neutered) Animals\n\nDogs $40.00 Cats $25.00\n\nThese animals have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, tested for disease and microchipped which has been paid for by donation. You will also receive a martingale collar/leash for dogs or a safety collar for cats. Additional donations are appreciated.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nJCs adoption donation is $300 and he is being fostered in Central Ohio. He has been neutered, microchipped, received his rabies, distemper/parvo, bivalent canine influenza, and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms, started on prevention as well as flea prevention. JC has also had a dental cleaning. JC requires an adoptive home with a strong, verifiable veterinary medical history.\n\nJC is a 9 yr old Cockapoo that was surrendered through no fault of his own due to his Mom having a stroke and no longer able to care for him. He does well on housetraining if kept on a schedule. JC is leash trained and enjoys going on walks. He does well in a crate trained for when you need to leave or have him in it for the night, he is a bit of an early riser and when he's ready to get out of crate will let you know. JC is currently in a home with other dogs, but truly enjoys being wit his person so we will be looking for a home where he will be an only dog. Enjoys sleeping in a bed on the floor and does not get up on furniture. Does enjoy playing with toys and chewing on nyla bones. He can reserved, likes to be picked up but very rarely jumps on lap, loves treat, a bit chubby, loves belly rubs. JC is currently on daily medications for Cushings which he takes like a champ and it is well managed. JC has done very well in rescue and adapted to the many changes due to the loss of his owner and we would love to find him his forever home where he will be a cherished family member.\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur Adoption Process\n\nThe adoption process has several steps involved.\n\nPlease review prior to submitting an application.\nOur adoption process is detailed here:\n\nhttp://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption\n\nOur volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs.\n\nSpecial Requirements\n\nSome dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a \"strong vet reference\" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.\n\nThe first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home.\nNo application is approved prior to the home visit being done.\nAt that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs.\n\nOut of State Adoptions\n\nWe do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer.\nWe do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.",

            "description": "Looks like: Pitbull Terrier Mix\nMale, 8 years old, 62 pounds\n\nLevi is the consummate gentleman. He knows where his people are at all times and likes to be near them but isn't overly invasive and does well left to his own devices. He has been housetrained since setting foot in his foster home and uses the doggie door like an old pro. He has a deep appreciation for food and is usually more interested in seeing if any nearby humans might have treats than in saying hello to other dogs. That said, he has been living seamlessly with a pack of dogs (4 small ones and 1 Pit Bull) in his foster home and enjoys their company. Levi has been infinitely tolerant of the dog-pile mentality of his foster siblings, allowing any or all to share his bed or curl up practically on top of him. \n\nHe is overall a quiet guy but does \"talk\" when he's feeling especially happy. Levi accepts and offers affection the way he does most everything else - gently and with a grace you wouldn't necessarily expect. He has never met a stranger and \"unflappable\" seems an apt descriptor. His calm, even temperament and soulful gaze are second to none. \n\nLevi has done well on pack walks in the redwoods, although he needs shorter adventures for now while he gains back some muscle mass and gets a couple of aches and pains under control. He has been relatively non-reactive to the cats he has seen and reportedly lived with children in a former home (although has aged out of being a physical match for the very young ones). He is simply an incredibly nice dog and an undeniable breed ambassador. \n\nLevi is from Hollister Animal Services and then was transferred to be fostered with Santa Cruz County Animal Services. He needs some veterinarian attention on his tail so POMDR brought him into our program to have that addressed and get him into a forever home.",

Dog adoption fees include a microchip. \n\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\n\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.org.

He's estimated to be 1 year to 1.5 years old and is working on all the puppy training and manners he has missed out on. He's on the skinny side and we are getting some good meals in him. He is enjoying the yard and playing with our bigger resident dog. He is very interested in our small dog who is currently not a fan, so he may do best with medium to bigger dogs. So far, he is doing well with going potty outside. He does not appear to be crate trained. We do not have kids or cats so we are not sure how he would be with them. However, he is definitely enjoying getting some love from his human fosters!

            "description": "Hello all and meet Mr. Brutus.\nHe is a Lab Mix, about 70 pounds and vet guess at 3-4 years old. He is such a love bug and thinks he is a lap dog. So we are working on basic manners, leash and crate training. He does know sit, down, paw and takes treats very gently so he was obviously someone's dog at some point. Like I said he is very affectionate but does not know his own size and is starting to learn he can lay next to you but not on you. He loves other dogs and kids but would be cautious of littles due to the fact he is learning boundaries. He loves loves toys and will play fetch.

Yori enjoys following other big dogs around and could use a pack to teach him all the things. He would also thrive in an active family that will feed his love of adventure and the outdoors. Yori is microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, and flea/tick treated. He will be available for adoption after his neuter appt. at the end of the month. His adoption fee will be $300. \n",

We soon found out she was pregnant, she had a rough birth and sadly only one baby made it. While Mimi may be a little quirky she is very sweet. She likes to be near you and keep close eye on what you are up to. She gets along with dogs although she hasn't quite figured out how to play with them just yet. This little lady is working on her potty training and does good around older kids who understand patience. Mimi would do amazing with a patient family willing to see the diamond in the rough as she opens up to them!\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

Within 24 hours of her rescue she had her babies at the vet and became the best momma! Her babies have all found homes of their own and now it's her turn. \nVelma is around 3 years old has a great demeanor. She's very sweet, cuddly and a great girl! She's 70lbs, spayed, UTD on shots and HW negative. She's seriously about perfect, and I never say that my fosters! She's 100% potty trained, submissive with other dogs, completely uninterested in my cats and super sweet and cuddly. Velma barks if someone comes to the door, but really doesn't bark otherwise. Not at all destructive - we haven't had any issues leaving her alone (we haven't tried to crate her). She does play with my dog, but I think she'd be equally happy with or without a doggy sibling in her new home. \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact.

My foster family isn't sure what happened but I had an accident before Saving Hope saved me! I have several ruptured discs in my spine and slowly my back legs have just stopped doing what I want them to do. I'm a wobbly boy but I have the biggest personality! I love to play but can be a little snippy so it would probably be best to live in a home with no or older kids and with a non dominant dog or as an only fur child! I like to chase cats so probably no kitty siblings either! Because of my spinal injury, I'm having a little trouble waiting to get outside to go potty but with a consistent schedule I can try my hardest! My foster parents take such good care of me that I try to be the best guard dog ever! Sometimes I can get upset with new people coming in my home so I need slow introductions. \n\nNo stairs/steps, no kids, no cats, probably only dog unless they're submissive, he is very protective of his home/people and will get aggressive. It's mainly right when someone walks in the door or up to the car. He plays rough and nippy but is full of love and just wants to cuddle all day. He goes INSANE for any type of ball and loves to sun bathe. He is starting to really lose his control of going to the bathroom. He will pee when excited, when or after he eats and he's been pooping himself awake in the mornings poor thing.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact.

            "description": "Meet Rudolph! Rudolph was born on November 22nd. He's thriving in his foster home and now is ready for his furrever family! \nWe've nicknamed him Rudy and he is such a sweet, smart boy! He has learned to ring a bell to ask to go outside to potty. He is having fewer and fewer accidents each day and is well on his way to being fully house trained! \nHe plays well with other dogs and children. He loves snuggles and prefers napping by our feet or lounging on the couch near a person. He's been sleeping in his kennel at night and doing ok. I feel he'd do very well in a home with other pets that love to play. He also loves running so a big backyard space would be ideal.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

All visits and Adoptions are by Appointment Only.   Appointments will be made in the order the inquiries are made and meet the needs of the pet.   Thank you.\n\nTanzi is a 3 year old Boxer Lab mix (best guess). She has a short, red coat with white toes and chest. She weighs in at 80 pounds and stands 24 inches at the shoulder. Yes, she needs to lose a few pounds. She was brought to the shelter because her owner had to go into an assisted living facility. She is very well mannered, walks nicely on leash, knows sit, down, shake, and come.  Tanzi does well at the dog park with other dogs. She initially plays but due to her being overweight, she tires easily and then goes off and does her own thing.  Tanzi lived with two indoor cats. Initially she wasn't fond of them but adjusted to them and eventually ignored them. Tanzi is friendly with people of all ages. The neighbor kids used to play with her in the yard. She enjoys playing fetch and will bring it back for you to throw again. Tanzi is an easy going gal that will make a great family dog in town or in the country. She will need regular exercise to get her to a healthy weight.",

She does very well making friends outside of the home but masks do scare this girl so in certain times it takes her a few to understand not seeing someone's facial expressions. She is still a happy go lucky girl that loves to please the people she attaches herself too.. She knows sit and learning more commands. Freckles has settled into her foster home but does guard her space to new people. She likes her space and not having too many people in her sleeping*(safe) area or up in her face. Best way to explain this behavior is Freckles lived in Boarding for 2 years of her life and now in a home her mind believes the Kennel is her home. She becomes protective of what is considered her space. We are working with this behavior by opening up more of the home to Freckles slowly but it takes time to correct.  Freckles is also being worked with in meeting people in her new home and that it is a good thing. Outside the home she will meet everyone perfectly with her handlers. People that she has entrusted her self too that will protect her.  Freckles would love a forever and deserves a quite home that understands her personality.  She would do best in a home with another dog her size and preferably a male as she doesn't like to be alone for too long and misses having a furry friend. During her time she has been enjoying daily hiking trips and exploring beautiful Hunterdon County. When back at home she is pretty low key and just soaks up being cozy and warm. She does very well on a leash but those pesky squirrels like to pull her attention sometimes so she is learning to leave it. Freckles will need a home with no children under the age of 18 and no potential grandchildren that the family will not be able to put her away while visiting. If you are interested in fostering or adopting this girl. Please message us or complete an application at our website at www.njmisfitsk9rescue.com\n\nCharacteristics\n",

We went and picked them up and they could not be any more adorable!\n\nBanks loves people and other dogs! Banks is a year old, he is a terrier mix, he is also up-to-date on all of his shots and is neutered. Banks is shy and a little more skeptical of things more than his sister is. Banks likes to \"be in the know\" and like to be in the middle of everything! He has one eye that is a light blue color and the other is a very pretty golden brown! \n\nBanks is a very loving, caring, and sweet dog! He is more on the higher energy level and is more playful than his sister! Banks loves his sister Ivy a lot! They both love each other dearly!\n\nPlease consider Banks when looking for your next family member and companion!\n\n",

She is good with dogs, cats and loves children. \n\nSweet Pea came to us from Texas after needing rescue due to a leg injury. We were told her leg got caught in a hog trap by the owner, the vet in Texas believes she was used as hog bait- not an uncommon thing apparently. She also had a few lacerations and were stitched and have now healed. There\u2019s more to her story, she also came with 6 underweight tiny babies that were infested with worms and fleas. Sweet Pea herself wasn\u2019t extremely emaciated. During her vet visit we learned she was also heartworm positive. The good news is heartworm is very treatable and now that she has put weight on we have begun her heartworm treatment. Anyone who is interested in sweet pea will need to bring her back to us one last time so we can take her to the vets for her final injection. She will also be required to limit any heavy activity ( not a big worry, sweet pea is a lazy girl anyhow). We know Sweet Pea is a great dog, we will be looking for someone special to adopt her.

            "description": "Joker was dumped in a shelter in South Carolina because he was left outside and wandered off (even though there was no fence to keep him home). Now that he's living inside a home and many other dogs, he has enjoyed becoming part of a family for the first time in his five years. Joker is about 5 years old.  He is submissive and very, very sweet.  He's a cuddler! When he comes to you, nose is down as beagles will do. Joker is a low rider and weighs 27 lbs. He has been with children, men and women and likes them all.  He gets along great with the other dogs and seems to like to be with the other small fosters in the house.  Joker is getting better with house breaking and with a little work, should be there in no time.  Joker's new family should have experience with Beagles.  If you think Joker is the boy you've been waiting for, your first step is to copy and paste this link to your web browser to fill out our online application, https://www.jotform.com/form/200215767055148.  Joker is now up to date on vaccines, neutered, heart worm negative and microchipped, included in his $475 adoption fee. Transport up north from South Carolina is an additional $125. We cannot be certain what his true mix is.",

Zoey is almost three years old (born 4/18/18) and is reportedly house-trained, crate-trained and not a chewer. We can vouch that she is a real lover. We're working on her leash manners (she tends to pull every which way) and her weight. (No judging ... we've all put on some pandemic pounds.) Poor girl arrived with an ear infection and some skin issues that we are working to resolve. Please check back for updates as we get to know Zoe better. Visit STAF.org for more information on our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions. You will be asked to return for at least one follow-up visit, then take the dog home for a trial period before officially adopting. \n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4510510.\n\nAvalon has been at the shelter for over 30 days and the stress of the shelter environment is beginning to take its toll on him. Avalon has been observed chewing on the bars of his kennel and licking the concrete walls which means he can't take much more of being in a kennel. When volunteers have taken Avalon for a walk, they have reported that he pulls hard on the leash to get out which is understandable since he's so happy to GO!! But once he gets out of the shelter, he calms down and walks great on a leash. He is very affectionate and gentle and will lean in so that he can get as many pets as he can. He loves his treats and takes them gently. When his walk ends and he comes back to the shelter, he goes into his kennel easily.\n\nAvalon is picky about his canine friends and would probably do better in a home as the only dog. However, he may be okay with another dog if he found his perfect friend. He needs a dog introduction if an adopter already has a dog at home. Avalon cannot live with cats or any other small animals and any children in the home should be more than 12 years old. If you think Avalon would be a good fit in your home, please come and meet this handsome, affectionate guy today!! He would love to go home soon.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Since we can't meet you in person currently, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be sent an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for you to see the pet. Thanks for your understanding!\n\n\nRocky Road is a sweet and playful Catahoula Leopard Dog mix who is about 1 year old and looking for his forever home. We have only had Rocky Road for a short time, but we do know that he seems to do well with everyone he meets including other dogs thus far. He was originally rescued from a shelter in Kentucky when his time was up and we have little information about his history prior to coming to us. Rocky Road's adoption fee is $299 and includes his neuter, microchip, vaccinations and routine labwork. Please email us if interested in adopting.\n\nRescue\nHelp Save Pets - Downers Grove\nContact Info\nRescue\nHelp Save Pets - Downers Grove\nContact\nEmail\navailablepets@gmail.com\nAddress\n941 63rd St, Downers Grove, IL 60516\nPet ID\nPhone\nWebsite\nhttp://helpsavepets.org\nDonation\nDonate to This Rescue\nTheir Adoption Process\n1. Submit Application\n2. Approve Application\n3. Meet the Pet\nAdditional Adoption Info\n\u2022 Must be 21 years of age or older to adopt a cat, 23 years of age or older to adopt a dog.\n\n\u2022 Must provide a copy of your lease agreement or association by laws if you live in an apartment, condo or townhouse\n\n\u2022 Must provide documents/receipts that specify your cat or dog\u2019s immunizations/required tests are current (rabies, distemper and fecal (+ for dogs- heartworm test and bordetella if adopting a dog) (+ for cats - leukemia test/vaccine if adopting a cat)). We can call your veterinarian to get this information, if you don\u2019t have the documents.\n\n\u2022 All adults in the household must be present and co sign the adoption agreement.\n\n\u2022 All your currently owned dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered. This is a non-negotiable requirement.\n\n\u2022 Heartworm prevention for dogs must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.\n\n\u2022 Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nEach Adoption Includes:\n\u2022 Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption *:\n\u2022 Rabies vaccine\n\u2022 Bordatella vaccine for dogs\n\u2022 Canine Influenza vaccine for dogs\n\u2022 Booster for canine and feline distemper and several other dangerous diseases\n\u2022 Fecal test\n\u2022 1st deworming\n\u2022 Heartworm test (dogs +6 months old)\n\u2022 Leukemia test for cats\n\u2022 Capstar flea treatment\n\u2022 Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n\nApplication Process\n\nOnce you have decided on an animal, you will be provided with an Adoption Questionnaire which requires name, address, phone numbers and asks some questions about your household, why you want a pet and how you plan to care for it. The Adoption Questionnaire needs to be approved by an authorized humane society volunteer. If an authorized volunteer is on site, that occurs quickly and if you\u2019ve provided all required information on applicable lease agreements/association by laws and current immunizations/tests for any existing pets, you may be able to take your new friend home immediately. If an authorized volunteer is not on site, you\u2019ll receive a phone call or email when the status is determined.\n\nAdopotion Donations\n\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $399 and puppies from $159 to $599.\nAdoption donations for adult cats range from $29 to $99 and kittens from $59 to $399.\n\n\nWe are a private pet rescue and are not affiliated with any government or national organization, and as such our adoption donations are set to cover as much of the cost for the spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, tests and medical care of our animals that is realistic. We lose money on every animal we take in as our adoption donations are less than what caring for the animals actually costs us. We ask more for puppies, kittens and purebred adults to help cover the expenses of the older mixed breed animals for which we receive minimal donations and incur significant debt. However, even at our highest prices, puppies and kittens are still half the price of pet store animals AND our animals are already altered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nPost Adoption Care\n\nIf you choose to give one of our deserving homeless animals a second chance at a good life, a New Pet Health Assurance Program provided by our partner veterinary clinics is available. This will cover the cost of treating shelter related illnesses should one occur, for 60 days after your adoption date up to $500. If you do not purchase this coverage, you would assume total financial responsibility for any needed medical treatment immediately after you adopt.\n\nHelp Save Pets\n\nSince 2000, we have placed over 10,000 animals into loving homes. Each one of these animals was given shelter, food, medical aid and vaccinations and time to find the right home. Our doctors mended mutilated limbs and cured many illnesses so that these animals could get a second chance at good lives. We have grown and now operate out of 4 locations, not all of them in Plainfield. In 2008 we changed our name from the Humane Society of Plainfield to Help Save Pets, still HSP.\n\n\nWhat exactly does HSP do?\nWe rescue desirable and healthy adult dogs and cats from pounds and shelters in mostly rural areas.\n\n\u2022 Many government funded pounds and shelters, especially in rural areas, have an abundance of homeless animals and scarce cage space to house them. The demand for pets from these shelters is low and the kill rate is high.\n\nWe rescue puppies and kittens that most rescues will not.\n\u2022 Many shelters, including other no kill rescues, will NOT take puppies or kittens under 3 months old because of their susceptibility to illness. Most are sadly put to death.\n\nWe rescue dogs and cats with curable health problems.\n\u2022 Many adult animals with curable health problems (some serious, including Heartworm positive dogs) are restored to health and offered for adoption.\n\nWe take pregnant and nursing moms with their babies.\n\u2022 We find foster homes for them to raise their young in a safe environment. Pounds put these moms and their babies down immediately because of the risk of illness, extra work and additional space involved with caring for them.\n\nWe work closely with Will County and Joliet Township Animal Control to help reduce the kill rate of animals locally.\n\nWe sponsor an Illinois Dept of Agriculture Humane Investigator, who serves our geographic area and investigates cruelty complaints.\n\nWe offer training and behavioral counseling to assist in the transition of adopted animals into new homes.\n\nGo Meet Their Pets\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\n\nMore About This Rescue\nHelp Save Pets is a humane society that has locations in Channahon, Downers Grove, Hinsdale, Oswego, and Shorewood, Chicago (Old Town) Illinois and Gahanna and Lewis Center Ohio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes:\n- Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*:\n- Rabies vaccine\n- Booster for feline Distemper, Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus and Chlamydia (DRCC)\n- Fecal test\n- 1st worming\n- Feline Leukemia test\n- Capstar flea treatment\n- Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n. Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption",

I came to the rescue with my siblings at just 12 days old and was accepted by a surrogate momma, Annie where I have been able to grow and flourish.  Now I, along with my sibling are now looking for my forever home.  The wonderful people from the rescue think I will not be bigger than 20lbs when fully grown.  I love to play with toys, my siblings and the other dogs in my foster home are pretty cool too.  If you are wanting to make me part of your family, submit your application today. \n\nI will come with the works (Neutered/Spayed, up to date on everything, micro chipped, fecal, heartworm tested if age appropriate, heartworm, flea and tick preventative, one month insurance and free vet visit).  What more could a new family ask for?  COVID 19 restrictions:  If I have not been altered by adoption I will have to return to my vet for my procedure.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and thinking about adoption, please visit our website http//www.wagginghearts.org and submit an adoption application. Include the name(s) of the animal(s) you are interested in the subject line of the email. Due to the high volume of applications we receive we are only able to process fully completed applications. We do not reply to inquiries. Since we are a foster based rescue we are unable to set up meet and greets until a completed application is on file and has been approved. \n\nWagging Hearts is a 100% foster-based, non-profit rescue organization. \n\nOur mission is to rescue abandoned, neglected, and stray companion animals. Please visit http//www.wagginghearts.org if you would like to adopt and provide a forever home to one in need.",

It was a cold day in January when they they got a warm room at STAF--and an even warmer greeting from our volunteers. They may need a refresher course on house manners, but are quickly remembering the comforts of being \"indoor dogs,\" complete with soft blankets and human snuggles. Rani weighs right around 50 pounds and is about 10 month old. (Est. birth date March 2019.) Her breed-mix is a mystery--shepherd/collie is our best guess at this point. Please check back for updates as we get to know her better. Visit STAF.org for more information on our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions. You will be asked to return for at least one follow-up visit, then take the dog home for a trial period before officially adopting. \n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

We went and picked them up today and they could not be any more adorable!\n\nIvy is one year old, she is a terrier mix, she has already been spayed and is up-to-date on all of her shots! She is a very loving dog! She is shy an uneasy at first about a lot of things, but she comes around very quickly! Getting attention, affection, and pets are some of her favorite things!!\n\nIvy is dog friendly and very playful! Her and her brother, Banks, are very bonded and love each other very much!! \n\nPlease consider Ivy when looking for your next companion and family member!\n\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

I came to the rescue with my siblings at just 12 days old and was accepted by a surrogate momma, Annie where I have been able to grow and flourish.  Now I, along with my sibling are now looking for my forever home.  The wonderful people from the rescue think I will not be bigger than 20lbs when fully grown.  I love to play with toys, my siblings and the other dogs in my foster home are pretty cool too.  If you are wanting to make me part of your family, submit your application today. \n\nI will come with the works (Neutered/Spayed, up to date on everything, micro chipped, fecal, heartworm tested if age appropriate, heartworm, flea and tick preventative, one month insurance and free vet visit).  What more could a new family ask for?  COVID 19 restrictions:  If I have not been altered by adoption I will have to return to my vet for my procedure.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and thinking about adoption, please visit our website, http//www.wagginghearts.org, and submit a completed adoption application. Include the name(s) of the animal(s) you are interested in the subject line of the email. Due to the high volume of applications we receive we are only able to process fully completed applications. We do not reply to inquiries. All applications are processed in the order that they are received.  On our website you will also find our adoption process. Since we are a foster based rescue we are unable to set up meet and greets until a completed application is on file and has been approved.\n\nWagging Hearts is a foster-based, non-profit rescue organization.\n",

He does not growl, but will run and it's possible he would snap if you go to fast. He has never snapped at me but I have earned his trust. He now comes up to me and sits in my lap. He came with a bad case of kennel cough but is better now so we are working on housebreaking. He is good with my other dogs both large and small.  He is thought to be about 8 years old and he is 6 1/2 pounds. If you would like to foster or adopt Wil, email lostcoveas@gmail.com. He will not be placed in a home with kids due to his fears. \n",

Critter Cavalry answered an email of desperation back almost 2 months ago and saw this precious boy's face. The owner of this young 10 month old pup (a Bulldog mixed with something intriguing) said that he had some neurological/genetic defects that made him walk funny and sometimes a little unpredictable when you try to redirect behavior. This boy has a very common form of Hydrocephalus that we are told is common in the Bulldog breeds. He was born this way. Lucky Chance is his name and we promised him that we would find the perfect family that would understand and Forgive his imperfections. This boy is always going to have his physical challenges and some of his mood triggers that a special needs sensitive family can work with. He has been raised until 2 months ago With little or no real guidance. He is good with other dogs and loves people but sometimes he is a little reactive when you try to redirect his behavior or what he is doing. I guess we could say that sometimes He is mentally challenged too and you just love him through it. His foster mom has seen improvement in the past two months and we are so hopeful that this 50 pound boy with the serious look (but is honestly Goofy) will be scooped up by a loving family that understands the compassion that Lucky Chance deserves. If you are interested please email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Hello everyone! My name is Baabs I\u2019m an approximately 8 month 30 pound little lady. I love people! My pastimes include snuggling, long naps, walks, and of course playtime with my foster family. I am very playful love to play chase and tug of war. Fetch is fun too but a little confusing for me. I prefer catch and play with the toy as opposed to returning it. I am a good girl, and am learning basic commands like sit. I\u2019m also fully potty trained. My foster mom says I\u2019m going to make the best dog for a lucky family I\u2019m very tolerant and good with kids. I will need a family who is patient with me and can continue to help me grow and be a great dog. I am still a puppy and can get excited and a little mouthy and need some redirection with my toys. I LOVE my toys especially chew toys. A fenced yard and an active family with time to play and work with on some basic skills would be a good match for me. So who is ready for some puppy snuggles and licks?\n\nThe adoptive family should have older kids only (10+) and a fully fenced in yard. Having another dog in the family is highly encouraged! Baabs would probably do well with a larger male dog with equal energy.\n\nThe adoption fee of $300.00 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! And that is the BEST breed!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup!\n\n*please note that we are a foster home based rescue and we do home visits as part of the adoption process - we are unable to adopt to families who live outside of the Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Thank you for your understanding.",

Please print a hard copy before you press \u201csubmit form\u201d. \n******************\n\nTimid Teddy is a 1 to 2 year-old male beagle who recently arrived on the freedom ride from North Carolina to New Jersey. He was rescued from horrific living conditions in North Carolina by our wonderful southern volunteers. \n\nTeddy is up to date on vaccinations and heartworm negative. Due to the urgency of the situation he has not been neutered. \n\nTeddy would do best in a home with beagle experience and another dog. A fenced-in yard would be helpful. Poor Teddy has never touched the ground because he lived in a rabbit hutch type house. He is learning to walk on a leash and is housebroken. Teddy is medium in size and gets along well with children, cats and dogs. \n\nTeddy will need a patient, comfortable and quiet household to help him transition to a normal, loving and wonderful dog life.\n\nPlease consider opening your heart and home to this great boy.",

            "description": "Because we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes. Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nMaximillian hopes the third time is the charm because his first two placements were not the right fit. He was initially surrendered to another organization at 8 months old with no history, and the nice family that adopted him didn\u2019t realize how much work a Doberman puppy would be with two young kids already. They worked with a trainer, who suggested rehoming him through IDR+ since we have a wonderful pool of adopters with previous Doberman experience who attend positive reinforcement training. Maximillian is now just over a year old, and he is a puppy brain in a 95 lb body. In the previous home, he took treats nicely, but he did not appreciate the energy, noise, and attention of young kids. Homes with teens that can be involved in consistent positive training can be considered. Older folks who don\u2019t appreciate getting jumped on are also not a good fit. His previous home had an elderly cat who kept her distance, but he seemed too focused when he\u2019d see her, so we aren\u2019t comfortable placing him with a cat. Maximillian would also appreciate being the only dog in the home. In his foster home, he can co-exist with x-pens and baby gates keeping everyone separated, but he lacks appropriate social skills to be loose with dogs. He comes on too strong, which is triggering for many dogs. He is not a candidate for a dog park.\n\nMaximillian has some anxiety, which sadly is more and more common in the breed, and our vet put him on a very inexpensive but effective anti-anxiety medication to help him cope. He will need to continue this medication for life. He still struggles with calmly riding in the car, so his adoption range is limited to within an hour of the Chicagoland area to minimize the stress of yet another placement. Maximilian will require a commitment to positive training, and he would appreciate private in-home classes so he can focus on learning. We can provide recommendations. He understands a few basic commands, but he needs more advanced attention to get him on the right track. He is treat-motivated, so he should succeed in the right hands.\n\nIn his foster home, Maximilian has a lot of energy and loves to play, run, and get the zoomies. His foster dad admits that can be wild at times and bounce off the walls, but he does settle down.  Like most Dobermans, Maximillian loves attention and always wants needs a \u2018job\u2019 to stimulate his mind and body. He loves to play \u2018find it.\u2019 He is crate trained and does not mind being in a crate while no one is home, but he would rather be with his foster dad when he\u2019s home instead of in his crate. He will contribute to work calls with his Doberman sounds. In his previous home, Maximillian got stressed when the neighbor dog barked at him through the fence, so he will require a 6-foot privacy fenced yard (no e-fence) to minimize previous issues. He also needs help to walk nicely on a leash, so don\u2019t plan on taking him for long walks quite yet. He is housebroken, but he needs extra potty breaks if he\u2019s stressed. We know this is a lot of information and high expectations, but Maximillian needs his next home to be his forever home.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

            "description": "Brooke is a 3 year old female Great Dane that came to us as a stray.  She was a little on the thin side and had obviously just finished nursing a litter of pups, and it did not appear to have been her first litter.  Since no one has claimed her, we wonder if she was not just bred for the money from the sale of the puppies and then discarded.  She is very sweet to the women here at the shelter, though she does get a little nervous around strangers.  Brooke will need a very large yard and will do well with someone that understands giant breeds.  Brooke weighs 112 lbs. \n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.

            "description": "Hi, we are Gus and Woody, or more formally known as Augustus and Woodrow.  Our former owner loved us very much but sadly passed away.  Several other family members tried to take us in but none had the right set up to welcome two additional dogs.  So we have traveled from Texas to Wisconsin to get our new start.  We are very much a bonded pair and need to stay together, although we do sometimes like a little space from each other.  We have been through a lot and it would be a much easier transition for us to go to a home where we would be the only dogs.  We were fostered with a cat in Texas without issue.  Older kids in the home would be just fine but we can be a bit jumpy for little ones.\n\n     Let us tell you more about our lives currently.  Woody gets up early at about 5:00, for a bathroom break, then settles back in bed for a couple hours.  Gus likes to sleep until 7:30.  We fill the morning with outside play and chase with each other and our two furry foster brothers.  We eat breakfast at about 8:30 and eat separately so everyone gets their fair share-no stealing.  After breakfast we go outside again for more play and exploring. We chase squirrels and once a bunny.  We follow that up with a morning nap for about an hour.\n\n     When we get up, if foster mom plays her ukulele, Gus loves to start an all-out howl fest.  He is the best howler amongst us!  He also loves to watch out the window for his friend Daisy to go by. She is a cute beagle that lives\ndown the street. and he loves her.  About this time we all go for a 30 minute walk in the neighborhood.  We love to sniff all the smells.  We get to see other dogs and our neighbor's little boys. We greet them with a wagging tail but have to be held back because we want to jump up with excitement.  We usually go on two walks a day so we recognize the kids and dogs on our route.\n\n     At home we snuggle and chew Nylabones, and play indoors until the next potty break.  If we see neighbor Al, we cry for him to bring us a treat.  We generally nap some more, walk again, and eat dinner at 4:00pm.  By then we are pretty beat so we do some couch lounging and alternate between dog beds.  We take a few more evening potty breaks, then lights out at 10:00 pm.  We settle in pretty quickly with our pillows and blankets.  Woody likes to sleep together, though Gus can get grumbly about sharing.\n\nNotes from foster mom:\n     Woody loves belly rubs and hugs, snuggling, running and playing.  He loves to eat and loves Gus.  He is sweet and funny and happy-go-lucky much of the time.  He whines when he needs to go outside for a bathroom break.  Woody can get cranky trying to adjust to new experiences but tries to adjust to the pack. \n     Gus loves all the things Woody loves.  He needs to go straight out potty when he wakes from a nap so he doesn't have an accident as he did the first few days here.  Sometimes he does a little snarl if he gets startled awake, until he sees he is ok.  Otherwise he is a pretty cool little dude that is not really afraid of anything.\n     Neither dog has any specific training needs and they are not needing to be crated.  They are living with two furry foster brothers and do like to play together but needed to be heavily monitored initially while getting to know one another.  They wrestle and chase squirrels and romp in the snow or get in the compost together.  They need a family with a lot of time for them.  They previously did not have that and Woody gets particularly upset about being left.  He needs to find a home that gives him security and stability.  They are good on leashes when out walking and good in the car, but Woody doesn't enjoy the vet visits.\n\nIf you have room in your heart and home for two great new additions, please fill out the application under the Adoption heading on our website www.bassetbuddiesrescue.org and a volunteer will reach out to you.",

When Lennox isn't trying his best to look super cute so you give him more treats, he loves doing his own thing laying around. Lennox was from a home with another older dog and probably would prefer dogs with similar independent and relaxed personalities (or even being your only dog-child). He gives the sweetest kisses and loves when you sweet talk him! Lennox would do well in a home with adults only because he gets a bit nervous with new people and does enjoy his personal space. If we had to use two words to describe Lennox it would be that he is a lover and a leaner! Lennox walks well on leash and is a super social dog once he gets to know you. This guy is easy going and easy to be around! If you think Lennox is the dog for you then consider applying to adopt him today!",

I immediately noticed she had severe separation anxiety. Thankfully with all that I have going on, Chanel stepped up to foster her. She goes into such a panic that she harms herself trying to escape. We even think she has a couple broken teeth as a result. She will get a dental in a couple weeks. For now she is on a soft food diet. Part of that may be she's spoiled and finicky, but she is still on the thin side. She is 13 pounds. She looks a lot smaller in person. She is a Chiweenie. She does not like to be outside. Her behavior is odd. She sort of looks to the sky and seems confused. Her head bobs left and right, like she's not sure where to go and she whines. We hope that will get better as she gets more confident. She is not interested in other dogs, but worships her new foster Mom. Chanel keeps her close trying to keep her calm. She even has a sling she caries around for her. She has been vetted except for the dental, so she can be placed in a forever home. Chanel says she's very much like caring for a baby. She's extremely sweet and loves to cuddle and give kisses. Applicants absolutely must be at home more than the majority of time. We hope she finds the perfect person. We don't have a history on her but it's hard to imagine this sweet thing ended up in a shelter in Texas. She really deserves the love and kindness of a new home. Apply at\nwww.misfitsdogrescue.org\nHer adoption fee is $150.",

A PUPPY/DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE. if a puppy/dog is still listed, then we are still accepting applications**\n\n*Name: Marine\n\n*Age: approximately 2 years old\n\n*Weight: 51 pounds\n\n*Health: Up to date on vaccines, Neutered, & microchipped\n\n*Requirements: Physically Fully Fenced & secured yard, no cats.\n\nABOUT MARINE:\nHe is curious, independent and adventure-seeking. He does enjoy attention and will roll over for belly rubs. Marine loves other dogs and seeks them out to play. He would love a buddy to run and exercise some of his energy out with. He absolutely loves water, and would love the opportunity to splash around in a shallow pool or shallow pond. Because he is a higher energy dog so a home with a fully fenced in yard. \n\nHe LOVES to play and run, he would be happiest in an active outdoor-oriented family who will allow him time to exercise. He does well in a crate, and is house trained. He is food motivated, so treats capture his attention and he is quick to comply for treats. He is currently working with a trainer for his manners and is doing very well. He is being E-Collar trained so a home with experience on this is preferred. Marine is currently in foster located in Cape Cod, MA.\n\nMarine is also Heartworm positive, Good news is that we caught it early, He has gone through the required treatment and is getting his monthly Heartworm preventative. He is doing great and never let it slow him down.\n\n\nMarine's adoption fee is $375.00\nApplications for adoption can be found at https://snarrapps.org/adopt-app/\nIf you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.\n\n---------*Important FAQ\u2019s*\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n- Please understand that we are a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read the FAQ's to see if your questions have already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n-If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are accepting applications :) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.\n\n-We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n",

            "description": "**This is a Courtesy Listing for a dog available for adoption at The Animal Pad, a rescue based in San Diego. Please use contact information below for inquiries.**\n\nMeet Windansea!\n\nWindansea was rescued from the streets of Tijuana in and was terribly skinny when he arrived. He is approximately 6-7 years old and weighs 70 lbs. We suspect Windan sea may have been hit by a car at one point, as he has some arthritis in his hips, but he moves well and enjoys walks and activity.\n\nWindansea has been at The Animal Pad since August 2020, but he keeps getting overlooked by potential adopters. They are missing out on a very sweet and mellow guy! He's great with people and would probably be happiest as an only dog. Windansea can be a bit reactive toward other dogs on leash, but he is redirected easily! He is very eager to please, and like the boxer we think he partly is, Windansea is \"chatty\" with moans and whines when he's excited, very food motivated, and LOVES to lean in for pets and attention!\n\nWindansea has come a long way from the emaciated dog he was when he first came to The Animal Pad. He's ready for his Forever Family!\n\nIf you think Windansea might be the dog for you, apply here: adoption application\n\nClick here\n\nadoption ad\nto see Windansea's listing on The Animal Pad's website\n\n**Frosted Faces Foundation has not assessed this dog medically or behaviorally.**\n\nPosted: 1/19/21",

Along with her need for human companionship, comes some anxiety so she will do best in a home where her folks are not gone for long hours at a time. Tiara loves toys, so she can learn some independence with a bunch of toys to concentrate on. But be careful, she loves to tear up the soft ones. She also loves to go for walks. Our volunteers report that she is quite a puller, but teaching her to walk on a loose leash will be a great chance for her new family to work on some training skills. Tiara just wants a family to love. To meet Tiara, call 513-735-2299 to set and appointment.",

Her friends tested heartworm positive but luckily, she did not. She needs a forever home and at 10 years old, she has a lot of pep in her step and lots of love to give! \n\nSENIOR ALERT....\nIntroducing Hailey!\n10 yo\nLab mix\nFemale\n61 lbs.\nHaileys life changed instantly when her person dies. She and 2 other dogs were then surrendered. The other 2 have medical conditions that will not let the be available for adoption. Those 2 may qualify for foster. So Hailey wants to find a home now as she is unsure of her new environment. She is perfect to me. Plese consider adoption or sharing her post.\ntapsshelter.org",

He is super friendly with a constant wagging tail! He walks well on a leash and ignored the cat he met. Kojack doesn't particularly enjoy the company of other dogs, but he isn't aggressive about it. He just prefers to be the only dog. Kojack will arrive in Massachusetts at the beginning of February. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to apply to adopt, please submit an application using the link below.\nApplication link (please copy and paste into your browser's address bar)\nhttps://ws.ishelters.com/application.php?k=coonhOUnd&t=Beagle%20Adoption\n\nAbout our rescue\nWe are a foster based rescue.

            "description": "SPECIAL NEEDS\n\nAllow me to introduce you to Chloe AKA Chloe the Magnificent! Chloe is a blind and deaf female cattle dog mix. She\u2019s currently about 9 lbs and 11 weeks old. Although Chloe experiences the world differently, she still does your average puppy things. She absolutely loves to be pet and have her tummy rubbed. When you first pick her up, be patient as she will wiggle around nervously until she recognizes your scent. She loves to pounce around, steal shoes to chew on and get in the mix with her Forster siblings. Because she is unaware of her surroundings at times, she may howl and cry a bit until she figures out where she is and feels safe. In fairness to Chloe, TRAINING IS A MUST.  Safety is of the utmost importance. Signs, signals and tricks of the trade you may have used with pets in the past may not work for Chloe. She will need specific and consistent training to fit her needs. Once Chloe warms up and is familiar with your scent, she will want to be by your side whenever possible, so a stay at home caregiver may be best. ONLY IF  you are willing to put the time in to join Chloe in how she sees the world, fill out an application at Louieslegacy.org and you will not be disappointed in the love and friendship she has to offer in return.  COMMITTED APPLICANTS ONLY!!\n\nThis pet's adoption fee is $500. She is being fostered in Staten Island",

            "description": "--I am a 1 year old, 76 lb, spayed female. I was a little too rough with the small children in my past home, so I am looking for a home without small kids. I am a super loving lady, who just wants to be petted and loved on. I love my belly rubbed and a good cuddle. And I'm smart too. I can sit when you ask me to, take my treats like a lady and share my stuffed animals (that I love!) very nicely. It is unknown how I do with cats, but I have done well with other dogs. I have been searching for my forever home since 7/3/20.-- **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

Once he knwos you he is affectionate and goofy and loves to play! He would be a great hiking or running partner. He does much better with women than men, but has learned to make friends with yummy treats and space. Riley is good with other dogs, cats unknown. Due to his issues meeting new people we are suggesting an adult only home for him.\nIf you are interested in this pup, please fill out our foster/adoption application here: https://form.jotform.com/92587410679166 and someone will be in touch with you shortly!",

No, he\u2019s not a senior, but we were originally told he was 7-8 so we took a chance on him. Whoopsies. Larson came to us from Northern Arizona where he was potentially used as a bait dog. Poor guy. He had over 100+ bite wounds all over him on his legs, head, ears, tail, and etc. Larson is all healed up physically now and ready for a forever home.  \n\n\nLarson is currently in a foster home and his personality comes through as he continues to gain confidence and learns to trust his foster family and furry foster brothers/sisters. He enjoys eating on a schedule and it seemed to help him relax knowing he isn't going to starve like before.  Larson is a good walker on the leash and enjoys daily exercise. He is great with his 3 foster siblings that include 2 female labs and a large male Husky.  Larson has not been tested with cats.  He loves loves loves attention and would do best in a home that has someone there with him a good bit of the time. Even a companion pup would be even better. Through continued positive reinforcement training and love Larson will make an awesome addition to any family lucky to be the ones to give him his forever home.    \n\n\nDo you have room in your heart and home for Larson?",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi. I am Joey, a 12-year-old Dachshund/Beagle mix, but I am young at heart. My favorite parts of the day are running outside and eating. A slow feeder bowl is nice for me, but not a requirement.  I am quiet most of the time until my beagle nose smells food!  I am also extremely visually impaired. It takes me a couple weeks to learn the floor plan of a home. Until I am comfortable, I do like to hug the wall when walking.  I am much more comfortable on a rug then on bare floors because I have a bit of a wobble in my walk and my balance isn't great.  This could be due to some spinal decompression, but at any rate, it  helps me to have something to grip with my feet.  When I am outside though, you would never know there is a problem.  I love to run and play. Bright natural light is great for my vision. I can be very stubborn on a leash. I have done very well around dogs and cats, but I do a lot of growling though. I know they are close, but due to my poor vision, I cannot see what or who is near me.  I do growl a lot when other animals get close to my food bowl, but I have never done more than growl. I have not met any children to know if I like them. I had to have all of my teeth removed so I eat soft food.  I am a great little cuddler, and really enjoy belly rubs.  The most impressive thing about me is how perfectly potty trained I am. I have not had a single accident and have not damaged anything in the house.  I am a perfect boy and deserve a great home.\n \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

He is all legs and is still trying to run smoothly on them. Clumsy little guy! One of his favorite things to do is play ball. He will bat the ball around with his feet, then pick it up and throw it and then repeat. With training he could really learn how to play ball well. He also plays well with all his litter mates and enjoys playing tug o war. He wants to be in the middle of everything. And then he will just cuddle with you and settle his head on your shoulder. It is important that the adopter of Bruce be VERY active as this boy will need a lot of activity throughout his day to get his energy out and remain healthy and happy.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

He is a love bug and is doing ok integrating with his foster siblings. We don't think he was socialized before he came to us, so it's been a process getting him to relax with the other dogs. He does great on pack walks and is learning that other dogs are ok! He is a professional napper and he loves to squeeze under his foster mom's little table to nap! He is very food motivated so that makes training much easier. He recently met some friends of his foster mom's and he did really good (snacks help!). \n\nThis boy is a bit rough around the edges, but he is truly a diamond in the rough! Once he figures out that he can trust you, you will have a friend for life! Come meet him and never spend another night alone!\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

They were surrendered when the owner found she did not have time to devote to the two dogs and knew they would be better off in a new home.  Molly has discovered that she can go over a 4 foot fence, going off on adventures while Baxter stayed at home.  Therefore Molly will need either a 6 foot fence or an invisible one!  She is very sweet but the lack of attention has caused her to be a little aloof.  That will change when she realizes she has her very own family to love her and give her the attention she needs.  Molly weighs 39 lbs.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

            "description": "Scooby is a friendly, 7 year old beagle who was surrendered by a local family for severe separation anxiety. Scooby has had a rough time. He was adopted from a shelter in Florida about a year ago. He was surrendered to the shelter with another dog he was bonded to because the family was moving. Unfortunately, the shelter separated the two and adopted Scooby out as an only dog. Over the course of the year,  Scooby became increasingly stressed and vocal being left alone and his family asked for help rehoming him. \n\nScooby is a hefty boy, weighing in at about 45 lbs. The best home for him is a home with at least two humans and another dog with the same energy level as Scooby is active and likes to play. When he is bored he will get into things, but has been going to daycare while at his foster home and has had no issues getting into things at home. He walks well on a leash with a harness. He is house trained, sleeps in bed with his fosters and is practicing being left alone for short periods of time. He is very food motivated and like all beagles, will steal food if given the opportunity. Scooby is being fostered in Massachusetts and is available for visits with approved adopters. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to apply to adopt, please submit an application using the link below.\nApplication link (please copy and paste into your browser's address bar)\nhttps://ws.ishelters.com/application.php?k=coonhOUnd&t=Beagle%20Adoption\n\nAbout our rescue\nWe are a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in foster homes throughout the area or in some cases in the south waiting to be transported north. We do not have a physical shelter. However, meet and greets are set up for approved applicants.\n\nOur Adoption Process\nVisit our website www.necoonhoundrescue.org for information about the Coonhound and Beagle breeds. Read \u2018Is a Coonhound Right for You\u2019. \nIf you'd like to apply, our application is available at the link above. Once we review your application one of our Adoption Counselors will be in touch to review it with you. Once the phone interview is completed, we will check your vet reference as well as a personal reference and conduct a home visit.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Spock earned his name from his very expressive ears, which fold over or perk up to show if he's feeling curious or playful. He is 4 yrs old, weighs 41lbs and has the build of a fox terrier/large JRT. Spock is an active guy who loves to zoom and play with his doggie and human pals and he can outrun just about everyone! He's outgoing and happy-go-lucky.\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please complete our online adoption application:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.dreamhosters.com/adoption-applicat\n/\n\nWe will conduct a phone interview, check references and then a home check. This helps us to match a dog with their potential adopter. The adoption fee is $350.00 for adults and $450.00 for puppies under one year which includes spay/neutering, up-to-date age appropriate vaccinations, flea/tick & heartworm preventative and a health certificate. We foster our dogs in homes, not in shelters. This allows us to get to know the dogs temperaments in order to match them to a home. This also allows us to get the dogs ready to live in their forever homes! All dogs coming from the south have been quarantined for two weeks and fully vetted before traveling to New England!\n\nFor more info please email Lifesaversapps@outlook.com OR visit our website:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.org/",

            "description": "Aries is a beautiful, approximately 70lb, 2.5 year old Dutch Shepherd Mix looking for a stable, loving home to call her own. Aries is well behaved thrives in a home environment whereby she is provided routine and structure. \n\nWhile she enjoys the occasional short car ride and new experience, Aries loves her time at home the most; her people and a snuggly bed are most important to her. Aries gets along well with other dogs and would love a furry friend to play with! Please keep in mind however that her play style (due to her size) is best suited with dogs of at least medium size or larger (she currently resides wiht a Jack Russell, but her size is best suited for larger play friends). Aries easily recognizes that kongs, bones, and hard toys that are designated for her oral exercise while avoiding chewing on items that are prohibited. Aries has done well with children, but her size might also make her a better candidate for a home without very small children. Aries is house trained, knows how to use a doggy door, and easily masters simple commands such as sit, stay, wait, etc. Aries is a quick learner and motivated by treats, including ice cubes! \n\nIf you're looking for a new best friend to join you in your daily routines and quickly become your #1 fan, apply today to meet Aries! \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

She likes to start all her play wrestling matches, even with the adult Great Dane in her foster home! Shes curious and loves to explore; being outside is her favorite because shes got so much energy. Shes very very intelligent almost to a fault and can be stubborn about doing her own things; but is quick to learn and listen with consistency. Shes been the easiest to potty train and lets me know to let her outside when she needs to go; she started this on her own around 5 1/2 weeks old! She will be 8 weeks old and ready for her forever home on January 28, 2021. We are guessing that Terra might be in the 50 to 65 lbs range as an adult. (mom was 50 lbs but the puppies are quite hefty so could be larger). \n\nTerra's mom is Sofie who is also available for adoption. Sofie is a ~50 lb, gorgeous black Pit Bull mix with a remarkable disposition. She lives with 3 other doggies in her foster home and does well with everyone. Additionally, she adores people and is well behaved with kiddos. \n\nIf you have the time, love and capacity to devote to Terra's development and growth, please apply at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $500 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue.

            "description": "Meet Mari!! Shes the second smallest of the bunch but is confident with new situations and people. Shes curious and explorative but doesnt want to do things alone; she likes to be with others - people or dogs. This girl is a jumper; she was the first to be able to jump out of the pen (gate open) and continues to push her limits on how high she can jump. Shes very intelligent and seeks for approval of her people. If something is happening she wants to be there and be involved! While she loves to sit in your lap and get attention shes will be playing the whole time not quite cuddling but close enough. We are guessing that Mari might be in the 50 to 65 lbs range as an adult - (mom was 50 lbs but the puppies are quite hefty so could be larger). will be 8 weeks old and ready for her forever home on January 28, 2021. \n\nMari's mom is Sofie who is also available for adoption. Sofie is a ~50 lb, gorgeous black Pit Bull mix with a remarkable disposition. She lives with 3 other doggies in her foster home and does well with everyone. Additionally, she adores people and is well behaved with kiddos. \n\nIf you have the time, love and capacity to devote to Mari's development and growth, please apply at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $500 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

            "description": "7 year old Minaj is a friendly outgoing playful girl looking for an active family willing to keep up with her. She's house trained and will sit for treats, even give her paw. She gets super excited when she knows it's time to play so some jumping here and there, well, expect a little even though she's not quite the puppy she used to be. She is good with kids, cats and dogs but supervision is still vital when introducing a new dog to a new family. Take the time, let her get settled in and let resident dogs, kids or cats also get accustomed to the new family member. Call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center at 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page to make an appointment to meet her! If you have the time and the ability to chaperone and are wanting a fresh lively face to add to your crew, bring your dogs and kids in to meet Minaj!",

            "description": "Meet Annie! Annie is a happy girl who greets everyone with a play bow and a big grin. She is a 4 and a half year old terrier mix that weighs about 60lbs. Annie gets along well with dogs and is very submissive to even the 10lb chihuahua in her foster home. She also gets along well with the cat and chinchilla at her foster home. She loves to goof around and will adjust her play level and style based on her human and canine playmate preferences. After a good play session Annie loves to get cuddles, belly rubs and ear scratches. She can't wait for a family she can entertain!\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please complete our online adoption application:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.dreamhosters.com/adoption-applicat\n/\n\nWe will conduct a phone interview, check references and then a home check. This helps us to match a dog with their potential adopter. The adoption fee is $350.00 for adults and $450.00 for puppies under one year which includes spay/neutering, up-to-date age appropriate vaccinations, flea/tick & heartworm preventative and a health certificate. We foster our dogs in homes, not in shelters. This allows us to get to know the dogs temperaments in order to match them to a home. This also allows us to get the dogs ready to live in their forever homes! All dogs coming from the south have been quarantined for two weeks and fully vetted before traveling to New England!\n\nFor more info please email Lifesaversapps@outlook.com OR visit our website:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.org/",

            "description": "Meet Blue Skye Lonestar AKA Blu. She is a gorgeous blue eyed beauty who is about 7 months old. We suspect that she is a Labrador, Blue Heeler and Catahoula Leopard mix. When she arrived in New Jersey, she was very fearful and felt safest in her cage. Blu has been with her foster family for four months now and she has come so far. Everyday she has making tons of progress with the help of her big canine foster brother, Bentley who is 70 pounds. He has helped tremendously in getting Blu out of her cage and she has not left his side since. It took her a bit of time to trust the humans in the house but she has doing so well. Blu can still be timid but that does not stop her from playing with everyone in the home.\n\nBlu's forever home must consist of another dog; ideally on the larger side. Blu has a lot of energy so an active family with children over the age of 12 would be best. She loves hiking and trips to the beach. She likes to go on walks but often times gets very scared of what she hears and sees especially in crowded areas. Blu is looking for a home filled of love, patience and lots of play. When Blu plays, she can be very nippy and nibble on the back of your legs and feet; which we are attributing to the heeler in her. Blu is very excited to find her forever home and proud of herself for who she is becoming.\n\nApply to adopt BLUE SKYE LONESTAR at EHRdogs.org!",

My name is Abigail. \n\nI like to be called Abby. \n\nI am 7 years young and really just want to find a calm loving home with my new people\u2026 \n\nI need a little time to warm up to you but once I do, I give free kisses and love for you to rub my tummy\u2026   \n\nAt night, I like to dive under the covers and burrow all the way to the foot of the bed to sleep\u2026   if you are lucky, I will kiss your feet during the night to let you know I am doing ok down under.. \n\nI love to go on walks and am very good on the leash..  \n\nOH and  I come with my own harness\u2026 I also have my own bed, clothes and a \u201cdresser\u201d to put them in\u2026 \n\nI pretty much come fully \u201cready to go\u201d.\n\nI have had a few accidents in the house, but only cause my foster mom didn\u2019t know what I was trying to tell her.. and I was telling her I needed to go NOW !  but we have that figured out..  Foster mom is much happier now.. \n\nI do need a calm home with no kids.. sudden movements kinda scare me.. also, I do not really like being in a crate and can act out when put in one. \n\nBut I do promise to love you unconditionally as long as you promise to do the same..  \n\nI hope to meet my new family soon..  maybe YOU are the one\n\nPlease, if you are interested in me, put in an application with Tennessee Dachshund Rescue and reference my name\u2026\n\n**No kids\n**Quiet home\n\nAbby's  adoption fee will be $375.00 which includes spay, full vax, microchip, HW & parasite negative, dental (if needed) and any other medical issues treated.\n\nBecause of volume, we do not answer questions on this page.\n\nHouse Trained: Yes-mostly\nCrate Trained: Yes but doesn't like it\nKid Friendly: No\nCat Friendly: Unknown at this time\n\nAbby is currently being fostered in Memphis, TN.\n\nAdopt me, Abby at www.tndachshundrescue.com \nPlease list her name on the interested in line\n\nA little about how the adoption process works:\nWe are an all volunteer rescue so please be patient with us.\nWe usually have pre-approved adopters waiting for the right dog so it is best to get your application approved beforehand so you can contact us immediately when you are interested in meeting a potential pet.\n\nYou will be contacted once the app is processed for a home visit.\nIf you are already approved and see a dog you are interested in, please contact your adoption coordinator.\n\n\nCheck our FaceBook page at: https://www.facebook.com/tndachshundrescue/\n",

When she grew into something other than the picture they had in mind, they didn't want her anymore. Ouch. We think she's a winner no matter what her pedigree. She's around one year old (est. birth 12/19) and right around 50#. She's great in the car and loves playing with fellow pups! Please check back for updates as we get to know Aura better. Visit STAF.org for more information on our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions. You will be asked to return for at least one follow-up visit, then take the dog home for a trial period before officially adopting. \n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

She loves other dogs and does great with people and kids!                 \n\nSusie came to us with a prolapsed rectum. She had that repaired and for the last while has been doing well. But that is something to keep in mind and be aware of. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting susie please send us an email or apply at eastcoastboxerrescue.org",

            "description": "Gadget is about 7 years old, he weighs 8 pounds. He is spunky but not hyper. He barks when someone is at the door but he quiets quickly. He loves kibble and is a very good eater! He goes potty outside like clockwork and with a morning walk and an early evening walk and one or two quick backyard number ones, he doesn't have accidents in the house. He loves toys, but his mission is to remove the squeakers, he is obsessed with the squeakers! He is a lap dog and will snuggle for hours under a blanket. He goes right under the covers at bedtime and sleeps all night. He is also ok if he's in his kennel for periods of time. He takes a few minutes to warm up and get over his shyness but he loves people. He's been great with other dogs, but he prefers a few minutes of meet and greet before the first kiss. He is nervous when on his leash but does his business for you. He would love a backyard with a fence he can't squeeze though, he can get through my iron fence pretty easily.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

He will need a firm confident leader who has a good understanding of the breed. NO novice unexperienced owners for Prince. No cats, no small children, he is dog selective, would probably do best with a beta female  of his own size. Please consider giving Prince his proper forever loving home. An adoption application is the first step, if it looks like a good fit then a meet & greet is scheduled, then a home check is required as well. \n",

Pippa 2021-01-02-02\n\nBIO:  Due to their recessive coloring (Blue/Tan Piebald and Isabella/Tan) Emma and Pippa will not be adopted to any state other than FL\n\nThese precious little girls came into rescue due to a toddler in their family.  Unfortunately, this is often the reason families surrender their doxies. Emma and Pippa are beyond sweet and are as lovable as can be.  It would be wonderful if one family in FL adopted both of these girls, but we will consider two families IF each adopter has another dog.  Obviously, Emma and Pippa are used to the companionship of another dog.  They are enjoying the company of their foster brother and sister, too.\n\nWhat these girls need in their adoptive home:\n  - No apartment or high rises\n  - A fenced yard is a must, no exceptions\n  - Someone home a lot as they enjoy human contact.\n  - No other dog is necessary if they are adopted together, but if you only want one of the girls then you must have another small dog.\n  - FL adopter due to their recessive coloring which causes thin coats (alopecia).\n\nEmma LOVES to be with her person.  She is very quiet and so adorable with her unusual blue and tan piebald coat. Sadly, Emma lost all 31 of her remaining teeth when she had her dental.  That does not stop her from enjoying every morsel of her soften food!  She is on special diet kibble (soften and pulverized) while her gums heal and she loses 2 more lbs.  Looking on the bright side, she\u2019ll never have to have another dental!  Oh, she does snore a little at night ... but it\u2019s very cute!\n\nPippa is full of life!  If we didn\u2019t have her DOB, we\u2019d swear she was only 5-6 years old.  She would be so happy to have a playmate.  She never meets a stranger ... she LOVES everyone .... friendly, friendly, friendly!  Pippa lost 6 teeth at her dental including two upper canines. She loves mealtime and is first into the crate to wait for dinner to be served!  While her gum flaps heal, she is eating soften kibble.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for sweet, friendly, and lovable doxies, Emma and Pippa will answer your prayers!",

Well they're just plain wrong because I've been DNA tested and my results came back pure Catahoula Leopard Dog! Yep, my parents were Catahoulas, my parent's parents were Catahoulas and even my parent's parent's parents were Catahoulas! How's that for science?! Being true to my breed, I'm an active girl with plenty of energy to keep you on your toes. Traditionally Catahoulas were used to herd hogs and cows, so being a workin' girl and having a job (or at least plenty of exercise and activities) will keep me at my happiest. And after a long day's work, kicking back and spending some quality time with my person(s) is my idea of a great way to spend an evening. Just don't make me share you with another dog, please. I want to be your one and only, that's my only request. So how about it? Is an active girl with a big heart for her humans what you're looking for in a dog? If you said yes, then I'm your girl!",

I like participating in playgroups here at the Shelter, where I have been social and playful with other dogs. I'm a sweet, energetic girl and could benefit from some obedience classes to learn better leash manners, since I can be a strong puller at times. I also need to curb my enthusiasm and not jump up when meeting new people. My adoption fee is $150, plus $25 for an annual dog license, if you live in Jackson County. For more information or to set up an appointment to meet adoptable animals, please call the Jackson County Animal Shelter at 541-774-6654.",

Although I couldn't tell the staff what happened to me, they knew it was traumatic. I could not see out of my right eye and there was a hole in my nasal cavity which was causing me some problems. A specialist came to visit me and did a special surgery. He fixed the hole, but had to remove my eye. I'm doing so much better now, and am spending time in a foster home where I'm getting spoiled. They say I'm a great dog, who will do best in a home with adults only or teenage kids and will do best with an experienced dog owner. I like to play with other dogs my size, my can be annoying to them if they don't want to play. Thanks to Dolly's Dream, my adoption fee is sponsored and I will get to go home with the goodies I need to settle into my new home. Please call the adoption desk at 954-989-3977 ext. 6 if you have any questions. Visit humanebroward.com to complete an adoption application and since I am in a foster home, the adoption department can schedule an appointment for you to come in and meet me with my foster mom.",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nMy name is Moxie and I am a female Dachshund, about 6 years old and 12 lbs. My owner passed away so I ended up in a shelter and Homeward Bound took me in. I had some skin issues which are getting better and I had to have a dental cleaning including extractions. I can be a bit nervous but once I trust you, I am OK. Because of this, I would prefer a home without young children. I like calm dogs that respect me and my space; and I don't even notice the cat. I will need a fenced yard.  If you are interested in me, please fill out an application online and list me as the dog you\u2019re interested in. Hope to meet you soon!\n\n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

We're guessing she is a terrier/hound mix, but not sure. She's a petite lady though, at just about 24 lbs.\n\nShe is a curious, energetic, headstrong girl with a silly puppy personality. She still has some work to do in the house training department and she does some chewing - so, if she is to be left alone during the day a crate would be a good idea! That being said, someone who is home a lot to work with Delilah would be an ideal adopter.\n\nDelilah is very social with other dogs and loves to play and run at the dog park. She is still learning her manners, and would best in a home with a dog that is patient and friendly with puppies... because she DOES want to play! It takes a bit to wear Delilah out, but when she settles down she loves to curl up next to you to rest. She also loves to look out the window and watch the world go by.\n\nA home without cats would be best (she constantly chases and barks at her foster's cats!) and no small children as she's still learning her manners to not jump up.\n\nAs we learn more about her, we are thinking she might need a home with a fenced in yard and another dog.\n\nInterested in adopting?

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nMilo just arrived. He is a young guy\nat approx 2 years old. He does need some leash work as he is very strong. Milo is a sweet boy, but f\nor now Milo is not a fan of men and does best with woman. His foster home is still assessing him for additional information and requirements but we do know he can be dog selective so he would be best as an only dog. Children in the home should also be 12+ as he can be exuberant. More information and additional restrictions may be added once he fully settles into foster care and we learn his full likes and dislikes.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

Unfortunately she is just not a girl who can live with other girls and was booted out by the others in the home. So sad, but they said she would be fine with the boys, just get her out of here!!!\n\nAh Coco - your owners were much kinder, they said you are a love bug - just want to cuddle with them. They say you are very friendly and love affection, that you are playful and are in the process of trying to learn not to jump up on them. They also mentioned that you are often stubborn and do not always come when called (maybe they didn't realize that is just a Pyr trait) and that you know the commands of sit, over, and down and that you were learning how to \"do nothing\" with the alpacas. Their trainer says you lack a little confidence ...hmmm\n\nYour Pyrents liked you being outside and doing chores with them around the alpaca and having free roam of the 5 acre property. You were a good girl to sleep in your crate at night - which was safer for the other dogs in the house!\n\nAll we need to do now is find you just the right home to appreciate all of your finer qualities - and I'm sure we can do that.",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nThis handsome 2.5 year-old dog with the bobtail is Rally who looks to be a mix of Aussie and Corgi. He was surrendered to a county dog shelter in February 2020 by his family who could no longer care for him. We don't know what circumstances led to him losing his home but the shelter was told that Rally had seizures in the past but was not on any medication. From the shelter, he went into a foster home where he was observed closely for over a month and no seizures were seen. Rally then made the trip to Canine Lifeline in late March 2020 so he could find himself the perfect new home. He was adopted from us in April 2020 but recently returned (Jan 2021) because he never became completely comfortable with the man in the home. Rally is going to need a home with a dog-savvy single woman who can provide the exercise and training that this active young dog needs. Rally only had one mild seizure in the 9 months he was in his most recent home. No medication is prescribed unless the seizures become more frequent. Rally is crate-trained and and has good house manners in his foster home so should be able to pick up the house rules quickly in his new home. He gets along well with other dogs and likes playing with them so might enjoy having a playful canine buddy in his new home or regular trips to doggie daycare. Rally loves tennis balls and toys but does exhibit some resource guarding according to his previous owner so his new owner will need to continue working with him on that and managing the situation to set him up for success. Rally walks nicely on a leash and would make a great hiking, walking, or jogging buddy. Being a herding breed, Rally needs a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation each day. We do want to place him in a home that has a yard with a secure aboveground fence so he can run and play to his heart's content. Rally weighs about 38 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Rally. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Rally and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH. 2/1/21 1:42 PM",

            "description": "Hello potential loving home! My name is Paul and I am a black and white American Staffordshire Terrier Blue Heeler mix who is approximately 8 months old. I found myself at Animal Allies after my previous home could no longer care for me and I'm now looking for a new, loving home to call my own! I am a very energetic boy that can be shy when you first meet me so I would love a home where I can get used to my humans on my own time. Because of this I am looking for a home with another dog to help me come out of my shell! Once I warm up to you I would love to play all day whether it be fetch with my favorite squeaky toy or tug-o-war so that I can snuggle all night. If you are interested in adopting me, please call the adoption team at 218-722-5341 for more information! Our adoption staff is available by phone starting right at 10:30 to 6:00 PM Tuesday-Saturday, and 10:30 to 4:00 PM Sunday. Our adoption process is first come first serve so whoever reaches our staff first will have the opportunity to place a hold.\n\nPAUL'S ADOPTION FEE: $350 plus tax.

I found myself at Animal Allies after I was transferred from a different shelter and I'm now looking for a new, loving home to call my own! I am very shy and nervous and I am looking for a home that will be patient and allow me plenty of time to come out of my shell. If you are interested in adopting me, please call the adoption team at 218-722-5341 for more information! Our adoption staff is available by phone starting right at 10:30 to 6:00 PM Tuesday-Saturday, and 10:30 to 4:00 PM Sunday. Our adoption process is first come first serve so whoever reaches our staff first will have the opportunity to place a hold.\n\nFROSTIE'S ADOPTION FEE: $275 plus tax. This fee is used for the extensive costs associated with vetting and otherwise caring for Frostie and future pets at our shelter.

I love the dog beds, playing with all the other dogs big and small in the house, trying to climb the cat tree and stealing my foster moms shoes (yum). I love to play, whether it be with another pup or a toy then I love to nap in the dog bed with my brother.\nI have enough energy to keep up with the big doggos, and have no fear when we are inside playing. I am still trying to figure out this cold outdoors thing, not my fav but I do sometimes go potty out there and love to find leaves and sticks to chew on.\nI live with 2 dogs and 2 cats and have been good with both. I am working on crate training and potty training right now but both are coming along!\n\nPLEASE READ COMPLETELY \n\nAll of our kids are being raised in volunteer foster homes, so we do not have a single location to visit. You will need to submit an application to be approved for a Meet and Greet.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or more information please do the following before contacting Path of Hope: \n\n1. Go to our website www.pathofhoperescue.com \n2. Thoroughly read through the FAQ section on the \"Adopt\" page (this will answer most questions!)\n3. If you are still interested, fill out an online application on our website and our Matchmaker will be in touch with you! \n4. Follow us on facebook, https://www.facebook.com/pathofhoperescue/ , to see lots of cute puppy photos. learn about puppy events, and get updates on the rescue!\n\nOur adoption fee for puppies is $400 and includes age appropriate core vaccines, minimum two rounds of dewormer, microchip with free registration and spay/neuter surgery. A refund of $100 is available with completion of any training class.",

He has healed so well!! \n\nBurgy is a 1 year old shar pei mix. He is very hesitant of making new human friends but he does come around. He may bark at first. . Because of this we require a child free home! No growling dogs in a house with kids please!  He\u2019s gotten to know and love the staff and volunteers and we have loved this smooshy faced boy right back. \n\nBecause of his dog bites, Burgy doesn\u2019t want any dog friends ?. We recommend he is the only dog. We do not know how he is with other animals. Please bring them in a hard carrier for a meet. \n\nHe will need a home who is willing to work on his socialization. Not every human is bad and he would do amazing with some professional training toward other dogs. \n\nWhen you adopt a dog, PLEASE research decompression. This is key to a dog adapting to a home. \n\nAll dogs listed as on HOLD are NOT available for viewing by the public, unless you are their owner. \nOnce a dog is no longer on HOLD, it is able to be viewed by the public, participate in meet & greets, and be adopted!\n\nAdoption cost per dog is $99.00 (puppies under 6 months of age are $150.00). The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

            "description": "Tiki is a very sweet and active young dog. She can be shy with strangers but as soon as a treat is offered, she is your new best friend and cannot get enough petting and playing. Her family did not have the time for an active heeler breed, so Tiki spent a lot of time alone.  She was surrendered so that she could find a home with a yard to romp in, where there is plenty of time for her to learn good manners.  \n\nTiki is a very sweet girl and learns very quickly. She knows a few commands but will benefit from gentle yet firm positive feedback training. Tiki is always happy to have people around her and is very playful, but she can be selective in choosing her canine friends.\n\nTiki is about one year old and weighs 40 pounds.\n\nIf you would like to meet Tiki, or find out more, please call (707) 884-1304 and leave a message, or send an email to redwoodcoasthumane@gmail.com. Dogs are shown by appointment only, so please make arrangements in advance.\n\nRedwood Coast Humane Society dog adoptions cost $100.00 which includes all age-appropriate vaccinations, and spay/neuter.",

All children in the home must be at least 5 years of age. We appreciate your understanding of these policies. \n\nCupid is the only girl in her litter of brothers and she loves nothing more than wrestling with them and playing chase. She is smart, cute, and she adores chew toys! We rescued her mom Ginger from South TX and we found out when she arrived that she was pregnant. She had 5 healthy babies who have thrived in their foster home. Their mom weighs approx 40 lbs and appears to be a hound/terrier mix so that is our best guess on size and breed. After Cupid finishes playing then it is cuddle time with her foster family but she is hoping to find a forever home soon to share her cuddles with .... could it be with you? \n\nLike all puppies, Cupid needs an adopter who is willing to train and work with her to help her be the best dog she can be.\n\nIf you would like to meet Cupid, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

We don\u2019t know how she ended up a stray but we did know we couldn\u2019t let her lose her life and have humans fail her again. \n\nZinzi was estimated to be around 6 years old by the shelter. She is a rather plump gal weighing around 120 pounds. She could definitely benefit from shedding a few pounds- maybe lose that Covid weight together for summer? Because she will be a larger gal even after losing some pounds, the shelter thinks she was used for breeding. We will never know, but we do know she deserves the best life! \n\nBecause of her size, and probable lack of being ever loved and treated at as a family dog, we are recommending a home without young children. She does well with meeting teenagers and adults but has not met a young child yet. Zinzi is also not the biggest fan of being in her crate. She is much happier outside of a crate hanging and lounging with her people. \n\nAt this time we are requiring her forever family to be familiar with her breed. \nIf you are interesting in fostering or adopting Zinzi, please visit our website to fill out an application! \nwww.safewithusanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Beluga is a energetic young lady who is looking for a fun and active household who can keep up with her puppy antics. Beluga absolutely loves people as well as other\ndogs\n, though her enthusiasm may be a bit much for cats, small dogs, and children under 12 years old. Beluga values her playtime more than anything else, so we are requiring that she go to a home with another active and tolerant large dog. Beluga will need an owner who is committed to helping her with basic training and manners, she can get a bit mouthy when she is excited, but she means no real harm. This adorable pooch has quite a bit of energy to burn, so a home with a yard would be ideal for her to zoom around in. Beluga is crate trained and housebroken, though she may have a few accidents for the first few days in a new home.\n\nAge: 6-8 months\n\nHow I came to PAWS: Surrendered due to landlord issues\n\nAnimal ID#: 48941\n\nWeight: 42 lbs\n\nMixed breed (It's impossible to identify breed mix by sight alone, so for most dogs, their mix is only a guess. We get to know each dog as an individual and strive to make matches based on personality, not on breed label.)\n\nLocation: Foster Care\n\nAll our dog meets are by appointment only; to get started, please complete the adoption application. To learn more about this dog, please contact us at adoptions@phillypaws.org or 215-298-9680 ext. 16._____________________________________\nTo adopt a cat, complete the application at phillypaws.org/catapp.To adopt a dog, complete the application at phillypaws.org/dogapp.\nPlease reference this animal's ID NUMBER when inquiring.\nLearn more about PAWS' adoption process, locations, and more at: phillypaws.org/adopt/info.\n__________________________________________Adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter, and microchip. Adoption fees are as follows, plus tax: $150 for large adult dogs (older than 1 year); $250 for small dogs (under 25 lbs) and all puppies (under 1 year); $60 for adult cats (over 6 months of age), and $100 for kittens (under 6 months of age). When you adopt a pair of kittens together, the total adoption fee is $150.\nPAWS, the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society, is a 501(c)3 non-profit animal rescue organization dedicated to saving Philadelphia's homeless and at-risk animals. PAWS is the city's largest rescue partner and provider of low-cost, basic veterinary care. Through our adoption locations, special events, and network of foster homes, PAWS finds loving homes for thousands of animals every year. PAWS is working to make Philadelphia a no-kill city where every healthy and treatable pet is guaranteed a home.

I came from a rescue in Long Island, so I'm quite the traveler. I'm getting older, so my sight and hearing aren't the best anymore. I'd really like a quiet home where I'm the only animal. My ideal day would include going for a nice walk outside and then jumping right on the couch to watch TV or take a nap! If you'd like to be my new best friend, please fill out an application to meet me!\nThanks and have a good day,\nMr. Morales\n\nMiles Morales has some minor medical conditions that are common in older dogs that qualify him as special needs. We would love to discuss his conditions with you over the phone or by email!\nPhone: (845)452-7722 ext.420\nEmail: adoptions@dcspca.org",

            "description": "Bumble is a gorgeous, female mix dog who is 5 years old and weighs 45 lbs. She is spayed, up to date on shot. Bumble does well with dogs, children and cats. Bumble will be a little shy at first, but will quickly warm up to her new family. She is crate trained, potty trained and does well on a leash.\n\nBumble was rescued by the Houston SPCA from an extreme neglect situation in Texas. Due to the years of neglect, she has tested heartworm positive. She is under the care of a vet in Texas, and will come with the slow kill heartworm medicine needed to complete her treatment (8-12 months) \n\nBumble has come a very long way from when she was rescued- she had severe mange (so much that she was almost completely hairless) and was starving to death. She has made almost a full recovery from her dire situation and she now  has a clean bill of health and so deserves a family to call her own!   Bumble would love the chance to feel safe, warm and loved for the rest of her life. The last picture shows how far sweet Bumble has come!\n\n\nShe comes with her medical records as well as the medication required to complete her heartworm treatment.  Our dogs also come with free 30-days of health insurance which reimburses you for any vet you use for illnesses and injuries which commence during that period, as per the directions in the flier which comes in your adoption packet.\n\n\nIf you are serious about adopting Bumble, please contact us at DogTrailRides@gmail.com or text or call 832-338-7041 or 281-844-7140. We take payments through Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, or we can take card numbers over the phone and process them through Square. All of these methods provide a receipt.\n\nThank you for supporting our efforts! \nWe cannot guarantee breed. We assign breed designations based on veterinary advice and information from the prior owner.",

Reggie gets jumpy and excited when meeting new people but only because he wants attention. \n\nReggie has a lot of energy and could chase a tennis ball around all day long. Because of this, he would benefit most from an active home that's familiar with high energy dogs. He would love his new family to work with him on bringing the tennis ball back after he chases it!\n\nBecause of Reggie's playful, high energy personality, he might do best in a home with older children. \n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

She is very active and playful and would do best in an active home. She has started training through Dayton Dog Training Club but will need continued basic training skills once in a new home to maintain what she has learned. We also recommend she meet any potential \"dog siblings\" before going home with them and may need an active, playful dog friend that can match her excited play style. She is a happy dog that gets excited to see you! She is very sweet and likes getting snuggles. She is a big, strong girl so any potential adopter should be prepared for her size, strength, and energy. She is a good girl that just wants a family to call her own! If you think CeCe would be the perfect fit for you, fill out and send in an adoption application to adoptions@hsdayton.org so our staff can review it, and if approved, we will contact you to set up a time to meet with her!",

            "description": "Gibby is very friendly with people likes car rides going on walks and runs and taking naps. He is good in the house and prefers to be inside during the day. He is house trained and exhibits no destructive behavior to belongings or furniture. He likes to be with people all day. He has had no signs of aggression when I've had him. He is a gentle guy and very trainable. He knows 'sit' and 'leave it' and is very obedient. Best to be homed as a single dog or with a well adjusted friendly large dog.\nGibson's exercise needs are low maintenance for his breed. He will sleep at your feet while you work from home for or watch you cook and do chores. I work full time and take him out in the evenings and mornings and that seems to be enough to keep him satisfied. He would be a great companion. I suspect he would like to run around with another furry companion if I had one for him. He seems very excited when he sees a friendly big dog!\nHe does have separation anxiety but is manageable because he just wants a person with him. I hardly ever leave him alone except for short periods (10-15 minutes) but mainly lots of barking and trying to go through door or window to get to me. When left in the backyard for some time while knowing you're inside ( I watch him from a large window ) he will sleep by the door. He mainly wants to be by you. If there is another human out there he will follow them though- very friendly. He could benefit from crate training but I think it will take time. I have a crate for him and we are working on it. He wanted to get out when I put him in. Lots of barking when left alone even for short periods of time He needs a human to feel secure- not necessarily the owner. I have had friend and grandfather watch him and he doesn't react the same way. He gets a little sad but no barking and warms up to whose with him.\nHe presents prey drive - someone familiar with the husky breed will be a great match! No small animals cats or rural areas near livestock.\nWe are helping Gibby's current guardian to rehome him. Please fill out our online application and we will forward to them. Adoption fee would be minimum $100 donation to Furry Friends Rescue. If you have specific questions please send them through and we will put you in touch with his current guardian.",

            "description": "Raider is a big ole' sweet, loveable cuddle bug! He's got a permanent smirk because he just can't stop smiling and boy is it big and beautiful especially when we spend some time with him! Our big boy Raider is about 7 years old, but don't let his age fool you! When he gets excited he acts like a puppy! You'll see him jumping around, smiling with his tongue out and wagging his tail like crazy all while giving us some happy wiggles. After he gets all his fun time and tires out, Raider seems to think he's a lap dog! He'll come up to you after a day of play and lay right in your lap like a big ole baby. He'll probably look up at you with his puppy dog eyes asking for a treat or two. Did we mention he loves treats? He'll do just about anything for some tasty treats! Raider is very friendly towards people! Raider does good with big dogs, he just likes to take it real slow. He does seem to prefers people over other animals. He much rather be the only dog in a house hold. Raider isn't very fond of smaller animals so we recommend he goes to a home without any. Come visit with him and witness his happy wiggles!! He is heartworm positive but his treatment is included with his adoption fee and will be administered at the shelter!",

He will need 30 days to recover so is available as \"foster to adopt\".   \n\nMy name is Jerry and my owner passed away just before the holidays. Sadly, his family could not keep me so I was shelter bound until New Hope Intervened.  I\u2019m a cute little stinker who loves attention from everyone and will nuzzle my way into your arms for more love and pets. I have been fostered with dogs of all sizes as well as a young child and did great.  Foster mom describes my energy level as \u201cmedium\u201d. I love play time with both humans and dogs and when asked what motivates me most, it\u2019s affection.\n\nOverall, foster mom thinks I\u2019m house trained and do just fine in a crate.  I have also been left unsupervised in a house uncrated. I love fetch and do great in the car.  \n\nI\u2019m a very social, friendly, happy little guy so a family with other dogs to play with would be ideal.  I can be mouthy when playing so a home with children under 7 not recommended.",

            "description": "Apply to Adopt Me!\n\nRomeo had a sad beginning to his life. He was born as a breeder pup, confined to a small bathroom for the first year of his life. No one has taken the time to potty train him, so he has lived at a couple different homes. His last owner was going to dump him at her vet to be euthanized because she couldn't potty train him. So luckily he found his way into our rescue. Romeo is a super sweet almost 6-year-old boy who weighs 11 lbs. He gets along great with all people, dogs and cats, and is friendly when meeting new people. He is very playful, and loves to play with soft squeaky toys. He does sometimes get playful-nippy when playing. He loves to cuddle and be held. He sleeps well through the night (loves sleeping under the covers), with an occasional need to go out in the middle of the night. He knows \"sit\" and patiently waits for treats. He walks well on a harness and leash, but needs a soft harness that doesn't irritate his skin. He rides great in the car in a doggy booster seat. He has immature cataracts that minimally affect his vision. We don't know if his cataracts are congenital or if they will worsen. As mentioned, he is not fully potty trained. His foster mom has been working on his potty training, and he will go potty outside when taken out. Although he is not fully potty trained, he is smart and a fast learner, and with continued love, time and patience, we believe he will learn.\n\nTherefore, someone who works from home would be ideal for him so that he could be taken out often. He is also missing several teeth and requires soft food. We are looking for an adult-only home for him, and a home with another playful pup close to his size. An adopter who has breed experience is preferred, and we are requiring a fenced-in yard because Romeo loves to run.\n\nBeing a Chinese Crested Hairless means he has hair on his head, legs and tail. The Crested is prone to more frequent skin irritations, allergies and sunburn than a coated dog would experience, and his owner should always take precautions to prevent this. Although no dog is truly 'hypoallergenic,' Cresteds shed little to no hair and are on AKC's list of breeds recommended for those with allergies. If you live in the central Florida (Orlando) area, match ALL of his qualifications, and think you have the perfect forever home for Romeo, we'd love to find out more about you. Please fill in our adoption application and we'll see if you're Romeo's perfect match.",

I\u2019m a little shy at first, but once I get to know you my heart will shine through! I\u2019m learning how wonderful life can be with my foster mama - I\u2019ve missed all the attention, love and cuddles so far but I\u2019m ready to get caught up! In fact, I\u2019ve just found out how wonderful belly rubs are, and I\u2019ll roll over for you as soon as we are friends.  I\u2019m great with other dogs and love running and playing with all my pup friends.  My foster mama is a little biased, but she says I\u2019m really smart - I\u2019m learning my manners and working on how to walk on a leash.  I\u2019m a romantic and I believe in love at first sight \u2013 do you? \n\n*All of The Right to Live dogs are fostered locally in San Antonio Texas and will be transported to other states to their new families upon adoption. We believe fostering dogs and not having them decompress in a kenneled environment is more beneficial for the dogs and builds their trust and companionship in a family situation. Adoption fee includes transportation costs, previous/current medical treatment (spay/neuter, etc.) and a health certificate for cross-state travel*\n",

She is hoping to find a home that will help her lose some weight because she hopes to sport a yellow polka dot bikini this summer! She is friendly, affectionate, outgoing, and LOVES to cuddle! She is good with other large dogs and definitely prefers male dogs. She would be good with children 8 years old and up (she may knock younger kids down due to her size!) and will need a home without small dogs or cats. Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative.

While it is nice to have food and a bed and some awesome people who take me out for walks, I would really love to find a loving place I can call home.\n \nEven though I am still learning to be gentle and that I am bigger than I think, I love all humans!  But I do prefer the older ones, teenagers and older that is, because I don't realize that I am super strong.  I always show when I am excited because I have a cute wiggly butt and I shake it like a Polaroid picture!\n \nI do love going for walks and I am also getting better every time about listening to the human walking with me.  After my initial excitement of the walk, I will be right with you!  Sometimes I will jump up and I use whatever I can to get your attention, but I am working on that too, because I am a beast and I am being told not all humans like a giant lap dog!  I do also tend to be vocal when I'm playing, but I'm just so excited and I want you to know that!\n \nI know how to sit and I know down, I also like getting treats when I do things right!  But I prefer if you set the treat on the ground or toss it my way!\n \nWhen I meet new dogs, I like to learn a LOT about them, so I do need help learning how to meet new dogs properly.  Can you help me do that?  I love them, but I think because I am big, I kind of scare them a little bit. \n\n\nPlease help us get Hercules into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Hercules, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

Sheena 100% likes both men and women (her foster is a woman), she is just a bit boy crazy and it's adorable... literally falling over onto her back for belly rubs from men and just squishes into them. If we're talking perfect, she would probably love being an only dog to get all the spoils to herself but has been friendly with all dogs of all shapes and sizes that she has met so far and lives with. \n\nPersonality Traits:\nSheena is really overall a good dog and listens to corrections very well. Through continued training and clear consistent boundaries she will blossom into the best friend you've been missing. In the short time in her foster home she has been transforming rapidly. \nShe is a happy squishy girl with a bit of a take charge attitude. She puts her weight into everything she does, her love, her walks, her play, sitting on your feet, everything. the ideal home would not have small children or others that are physically unstable. They should be able to lift/push/pull her weight. Sheena is working on getting her slim figure back. Her ideal weight is in the 50/55 pound range, but she\u2019s currently clocking in around 75 pounds. She is housebroken, making improvements on her walks and very smart.\n\nFun Fact:\nSheena makes the best faces and is hilarious. She LOVES a good butt scratch and will back that booty up for it any chance she gets. She also snores and it\u2019s adorable!\n\nSpecial Needs:\nSheena will need ongoing, firm, consistent and patient training and boundaries. She is making progress on her boundaries, sharing and not having to run the show. As her trust grows with her foster, this does get better. She is beginning to seek love in lieu of attention and the payoff has been priceless. \n\nSheena is working on crate training, has 2 scheduled naps a day and sleeps in her crate through the night. When told \"time for a nappy\" - she hardly makes a peep when in there and will now go in on her own from time to time for a nappy.\n\nApply here: https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/ICY0zLb5eMAfRd8dptd7\n",

He enjoys playing with toys and tug of war. He would do great in a home with lots of space for him to play.  Panda has been picky with his canine friends while at the shelter so we always suggest a meet and greet with any dog currently in your home. Panda's adoption fee is $250. Contact the shelter at 920-835-1738 or email ocontoareahumane@gmail.com to set up an appointment to adopt. At this time we are only doing adoptions via appointment.\n\nCATS: Undetermined.  \nDOGS: Can be picky with other dog buddies.  Meet and greet required. \nKIDS: Undetermined. but has lived with them in past.\n\n\n\nOAHS is able to accommodate same day adoptions.  The adoptions are based on a first-come basis providing it is a good match for everyone involved. \nThe first step in the adoption process is to complete our adoption questionnaire to ensure we can help find the right fit for you.

            "description": "Hi there,\n\nI'm my name is Autumn.   Although I am very young, I think that Autumn would be my favorite season of the year.  So many fun things happen then like festivals and trick or treating, and of course, Thanksgiving!!  Hmm, I wonder if I like turkey...of course I do what was I thinking??  \n\nSo, my 7 siblings and I were dumped along with our mommy when we were only 2 months old.  I'm sad and confused at how somebody could be so mean and cruel to do such a thing like that.  Mommy would lick us and soothe us and tell us it would be ok, but I know she was very sad and heartbroken as well :(\n\nAs luck would have it, we got dumped in front of a house where a family's grand daughter was visiting.  When she saw us, she went running into the house to her grandparents crying.  She was so worried about us and wanted to take us in.  Sweet Granny caved and allowed the grand daughter to care for us.  \n\nGuess what that grand daughter did?  She got to work and found homes for some of us!  Granny then called the wonderful peeps at Lucies Project to see if they could take in the rest of us.  Well, of course they did!!  They are super duper awesomely amazing!!!\n\nAs you can see,  I am a cute puppy full of love, character and energy.  I would love to come live with you and claim you as my furever family.  What do you say??  Pwease???\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Rosalie\n*Age: 2 yrs\n*Current Weight: 65 lbs\n*Adoption fee: $300\n\nRosalie is super super sweet and loves her person!  She is wonderful with kids. She is still a puppy and requires supervision when out of her crate. She will self-play if alone and loves to chew on her toys and her bones.  She has short bursts on energy then rests, and loves to swim! Swimming is a great exercise for her and will help her to stay physically fit as her knee joints underwent reconstruction.  She is not in any pain and loves to run and play. She loves other dogs and we would love her to go to a home where she has another doggie companion! She will guard her bones, but has no issue sharing toys with others.  She will not do well on long hikes but daily walks and play at the park or simply in the house/yard will keep this pup happy and content with her family! \n\nWe do prefer she goes to a home with someone home most of the time (even after Covid is under control!) and with a fenced-in yard.\n\nTo apply to adopt Rosalie, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.** \n\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines, spayed, Was born with her rear limbs twisted from the knees down. She had difficulty standing and fully using her rear limbs before, but she's had bilateral TPLO surgery & is rehabbed & continues to get stronger! She can run, play, sit as best as possible but there are some limitations that remain.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

She will be wonderful in any size home but she must have activity or she will be a brat!\nShe LOVES to play ball and will play all day if you let her - but she can\u2019t be exposed to sun all day as she has very pink skin and can burn easily.\nShe LOVES to cuddle and will be snoozing at your side when play is over \nKanani is partially blind and does need a little extra patience:)\nShe does tend to misjudge distance and will bump into things until she learns their placement.\nStairs are fine after being introduced to them - she loves running up and down them lol\nShe does tend to be nippy and while small children are fine, supervision is always recommended. \nKanani is spayed, utd on all shots, microchipped, housebroken and crate-trained \nA Staffie experienced family is preferred, she really does have a very high energy level!!!\nPlease email us at mybestfriendrescue@gmail.com for more info!",

Unfortunately he needs to find a new home because he isn't getting along with one of the other dogs in the home. Hulk gets along with non dominant dogs but we would prefer no other fur babies in the home. Hulk is the most well behaved 1 year old pup we have ever seen. He has been trained and knows many commands. He LOVES people and is great with Kids. Hulk will be available in Medford Long Island for meet and greets. Please submit an application and send us a message. He requires a large fully fenced in yard. https://www.peytonssafehaven.org/adoption-application\n",

She needs someone to go slow with her and build trust in their relationship, once she knows you are her person she will be loyal for life. Chica would do best in a quieter home with no kids under the age of 12 for now due to her currently timid nature. She is not leash trained and gets a bit wigged out when she feels the pressure of the leash around her neck, so a harness would be best for now. Chica is a petite girl weighing in at 48 pounds of muscle, she is like a compact sports car.\n\nChica will be available for adoption on 1/20/2021 At 3:29 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

I LOVE other dogs and don't fully trust humans yet. \n\nI was running around on my own for at least 3 months before anyone was able to capture me. After about a few days in captivity (what the humans call a 'foster home') I was able to break my collar and run free again for almost a week! I need a place that can keep me safe and secure while I settle back down and learn how to trust humans again. \n\n______________________\n\nWe are looking for a foster-to-adopt situation for Carlisle. \n\nWe need someone who:\n-Has breed experience with a German Shorthaired Pointer or very similar breed.\n-Has a VERY tall, SOLID and SECURE fenced backyard. The more land for him to run on, the better. But the secure fence is the most important part.\n-Has at least one other dog. He LOVES all dogs and will not do well in a house without one.\n-Is willing to spend a lot of time being extremely patient with Carlisle since he is the highest order of flight risk. He has been trapped twice and if he gets out again, he may be too smart to get captured a third time.",

Our Chica is the girl for you!  She loves to be with you, whatever you are doing, and will follow you to the ends of the Earth and beyond.

Chica= Creating Happiness, Inspiring Confidence Always. She is not afraid to be herself and hopes to inspire you to do the same.  Come on out and meet our adorable Chica today!\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Leia!\n\n10-year-old Leia was brought to Long Beach Shelter as a stray and then became a Frosted Face on January 5th. She is so sweet! Leia is vision impaired and has an enlarged heart, but no signs of heart failure yet. Leia has been cleared by our vet to have much-needed dental surgery. Her little mouth will feel so much better afterwards!\n\nLeia is currently on a 2-week Frosted Fling so we can learn more about her in a home environment. She is really blossoming! Her Fling Mom reported in with what she's learned about Leia: She is potty trained! She uses the grass patch on her Fling Mom's apartment balcony and also goes to a local park for short walks several times a day. Leia is described as independent, mellow, and happy. She's not a lap dog, but likes to be the same room with her Fling Mom and asks for uppies and cuddles in the evening. Leia also loves belly rubs! She is a smart cookie who despite being vision impaired, learned the layout of her Fling home quickly. On walks, she's inquisitive and likes to explore everything. When at home, Leia naps often, but if there is something going on she's right there to check it out! She can be a spunky girl. City noises, elevators, dogs or people do not bother her. She enjoys new things and is engaged. Leia wants to be a part of the action! On her Fling, Leia has met plenty of dogs of all sizes, no issues. She has also done very well with her Frosted Face Fling brother. It seems like Leia would really enjoy having a doggie sibling in her forever home.\n\nWhat's next on Leia's Fling itinerary? She will be having her dental soon and has a spa day scheduled at the groomers! Her Fling Mom shares, \"Leia is really settling in. She's showing her great, sweet, and loving personality! I think she's just perfect and isnready for a fabulous loving family to cherish her!\"\n\nLeia is ready for her forever family! If interested in meeting this little princess, you can start the application process here: https://frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 2/1/21 KG",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Barbie is Chihuahua mix who will be joining us from Texas on January 5th. She was found abandoned in a home after the renters moved out and has been in a foster home in Texas. She is a happy-go-lucky girl who likes other dogs and kids. She will make a great companion for someone who likes activity and a couch potato dog. We will post more info as we get to know her.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\nBarbie is an absolute doll (no pun intended :) She is outgoing, silly, and full of personality. It wasn't long after she arrived that her tail was wagging and she was rolling around on fury blankets for the best possible back scratch. She has settled in seamlessly in her foster home. She is currently in a foster home with two other small breed dogs, but would prefer to be in a forever home as the only pup. She has been accompanying her mom to work a few times and has shown to be a great office companion - quickly winning over the hearts of all her coworkers. She has a great snuggly side to her where she will take an opening to crawl into your lap, or lounge right beside you. She is a cute sleeper with a faint snore :) She has great energy for walks and exploring, so don't let her small frame fool you. Barbie is looking for a committed forever home that can continue to work on her training. Barbie does need firm boundaries and a strong leader, to help curb some of her insecure behaviors. She can get a little possessive of her humans, so it's important she is a home that knows to set rules and boundaries with her.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $475, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued by Second Chance Dog Rescue in Texas and transferred via Project Freedom Ride. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

She is a 3 yo spayed female Anatolian Shepherd x Great Pyrenees cross.\nHarriette's estimated DOB is Jan 2018.\nShe weighs appx 80 lbs\nHarriette has recently had her final injection for heartworm treatment and is expected to make a full recovery with no adverse effects.\n\nHarriette was originally rescued from Louisiana last fall just before Hurricane Delta hit.  She is now ready for her very own family!\n\nHarriette is a super sweet girl who is looking for a person/family who knows and understands flock guardian dogs such as Anatolians and Pyrenees.\nShe loves her family but is often not welcoming to strangers and visitors so she is going to be\nhappiest in a home with low foot traffic and a quiet environment.\nShe may do best as the only dog, however she could possibly do well with a laid back male dog who is her size or larger.\n\nHarriette is housebroken and responds to basic commands as well as any Anatolian will!  She needs a yard with secure fencing as she loves to go outside and patrol the area.\n\nHarriette is not a candidate for a working home and she is not a candidate for an apartment home.\n\nAdoption is limited to homes within the state of Texas.\n\nFor more information please email asdrescue@gmail.com",

Although this dog has been through abandonment and who know what else, she is a smiling sweetie. You would never know that happened to her because she is a very friendly and outgoing! Gloria appears to be a shepherd mix of some sort but she is on the smaller side for a shepherd. She likes walks, exploring, and playing with her Chuck-it balls. She walks well on the leash and is always looking forward to her next one. Gloria was adopted from us before but it didn't work out, so she was returned. She wanted to be the only dog in the house and her new family would need to meet that requirement. If your household includes cats, Gloria will fit right in. Her previous owners told us that Gloria didn't have issues with the cats and would do fine with them again. In the home she lived in, she was a good girl with going outside and was considered housebroken. She did not destroy things in the house or yard and is crate trained. If you think I would be a good fit for you and your family, please make an appointment and come visit her today!",

As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt to homes with children under 6 years old; homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

He was emaciated, had a severe urinary infection and was extremely dehydrated.\n\nWe had a prior adopter who had recently lost her dog.    She kindly opened her heart and home to Tank to give him a forever home.  Unfortunately she suffered a serious back injury and had to leave her job.    Tank is just too strong for her to manage comfortably, so she has made the heart-wrenching decision to find him a more suitable home.\n\nWhen Tank was originally found, due to his poor condition, the vets originally thought he was 7 to 8 years old.    Now that he\u2019s recovered and healthy as a horse, we believe he\u2019s not more than 4 years old.  He is a large-boned boy and extremely strong.    He does need some work on the leash.  He is a super-energetic boy who would benefit from having a large fenced in yard to run in and play.\n\nTank seems to prefer women over men.    As we don\u2019t know his background prior to being adopted, we plan to have him evaluated by a trainer friend to see if he was just being protective of his owner or he just does not care for men. \nWe are seeking a home with no other pets, experienced German Shepherd owners and no children.    Although he has been good with his owner\u2019s grandchildren, he is a large dog who loves to show his love for those he cares about and he could quite possibly knock someone down.\n\nPlease fill out an application if you are interested in the very special boy.",

She has been bred and bred and bred but those days are over for her - now she is ready for a home and family to love on and be loved by. She is about 50 pounds and we think she is 2 years old. Rubi was turned in because she keeps getting out of fences by chewing and digging holes but she was not being treated as a family pet either. She gets along with people and other dogs but no cats. She is working on being housebroken and is crate trained. She walks on a leash and sleeps in a dog bed. This friendly playful active and lap loving girl is sweet as can be. Her puppies already found homes and she is looking for her own!",

He loves long walks and hikes and would make a good jogging buddy. He is strong and does like to pull when walking so he will need learn some leash/harness manners. Smart and highly treat and praise motivated, Stefan will benefit greatly from force free obedience and command training using positive reinforcement techniques. He will make an awesome companion for some lucky person.\"\n\nHe is neutered and up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. His adoption fee is $425. Please note that training is highly recommended for all dogs.

I'm not really into being picked up and cuddled on, I prefer to cuddle up in a comfy dog bed or with a pillow and blanket on the floor. I realize my snoring can be hard to sleep with so I don't even mind sleeping in the living room by myself as long as it's comfy and cozy.\n\nI'm about 8 years old and weigh around 15 lbs. I do OK with other dogs my size as long as they're not into my food. I really like my food and don't like to share it under any circumstances.\n\nI like to go outside and wander around the fenced yard at my foster home and I really try hard to do my business out there, although sometimes I can't hold it overnight I need to use a potty pad. You can trust me to be left alone because I don't really get into things, I kind of prefer to just sleep.\n\nI promise I'm not really much trouble I just need a safe space to lay my head and to be fed daily. Once I get comfortable with you I'm OK with you petting me, I just prefer to keep my feet on the ground and not be picked up. I prefer to explore around at my own pace. If my new family doesn't have a fenced yard, I will walk on a leash but let's keep my walk short because I'm not much in to lengthy exercise ;)\n\nTammy is spayed, microchipped, current on annual vaccines, heartworm negative.\n\nHer adoption fee is $250, home visit and vet reference required. Please apply to start the approval process.",

            "description": "Zack is a 10 month old male retriever mix weighing about 50lbs who loves to go go go! He's an energetic fella and loves to play. He is a sucker for a good squeaky toy, tennis ball or anything you want to throw his way. He is young and eager to learn. Zack is housebroken and working on basic obedience. Zack plays well with other large dogs and is constantly curious.\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please complete our online adoption application:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.dreamhosters.com/adoption-applicat\n/\n\nWe will conduct a phone interview, check references and then a home check. This helps us to match a dog with their potential adopter. The adoption fee is $350.00 for adults and $450.00 for puppies under one year which includes spay/neutering, up-to-date age appropriate vaccinations, flea/tick & heartworm preventative and a health certificate. We foster our dogs in homes, not in shelters. This allows us to get to know the dogs temperaments in order to match them to a home. This also allows us to get the dogs ready to live in their forever homes! All dogs coming from the south have been quarantined for two weeks and fully vetted before traveling to New England!\n\nFor more info please email Lifesaversapps@outlook.com OR visit our website:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.org/",

We are working with the owners to get the parents AND any other dogs on the property spayed/neutered so there will be no more unwanted, accidental litters.\nPLEASE NOTE: We will only be posting 3 puppies at a time from this litter until all are adopted.\n\nTheir DOB is estimated to be 11/18/2020. These puppies are just wiggly, happy, fun loving, and just your picture perfect puppies. They are very well socialized and are all living in foster homes with other dogs and children. Just like your typical puppy, they love to play, play, and play ALLL day and when they're tuckered out for the afternoon, they love nothing more than snuggling up to recharge for round two of playtime. These babies are going to be BIG and just like your typical puppy, they are going to need families who are enthusiastic and dedicated to continue their training and socializing so they can remain the best pups in town!!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: These babies are expected to be 60-70 lbs at least when full grown. They are NOT suitable for apartment lifestyle and will need homes with yards to accommodate daily games of play and preferably another dog in the home to play, cuddle, and socialize with.\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information, please contact Sandra:\nEmail: sandrahoperanch@gmail.com",

He is being kenneled in the South and his guardians shares:\n\n\"Mars is 85lbs. He is very friendly, affectionate and loving. Poor Mars spent most of his life tied to a chain outside. No one paid much attention to him... they would just feed him but no walk or playtime. Maybe that's why he gets so excited and greets new people with wiggles and wags and kisses too. He gets along with other friendly dogs well and would be best paired with another dog of similar size. He doesn't like cats at all. He does loves to go on walks and might make a great jogging companion. He is a smart pup and treat and praise motivated. He needs basic obedience and command training using force free, positive reinforcement methods. He is such a sweet loving boy who deserves a great forever home where he will be loved and adored. In return he will give you his heart.\"\n\nHe is neutered and up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. His adoption fee is $425. Please note that training is highly recommended for all dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing.\n\nTHANKS FOR ADOPTING AND SAVING A LIFE; you are MARS' hero!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Tall, dark and handsome male searching for an active companion to enjoy activities that keep the mind and body in tip top shape! Hi! My name is Dutch and I'm a 75 lb, two year old Dutch/German Shepherd boy. I really enjoy hanging out with other large, energetic dogs, but I'm not a fan of the kitties, so a home with cats wouldn't be a good fit. I haven't ever played before, but I'm starting to learn how much fun it is! I'm friendly with people, but because of my size and energy level, it's best I go to a home with older children only. My foster family doesn't know my back story, but they think I might have been an outside dog because I didn't come to them fully housebroken. I'm doing much better with it, but I'll need an adopter that will take me outside often and continue my training. I have a lot of energy, so if you're looking for a hiking or jogging buddy, I'm your guy! I also really like to learn. My foster family has been diligently working with me and I've just about mastered all of the key commands! We're still working on how mouthy I am, though. My foster mom thinks it's because I wasn't ever corrected or taught boundaries when I was a puppy. I'm mostly crate trained, but I can be pretty vocal for a bit before settling down. It's just my way of telling you to come back and that I miss you!! I love peanut butter filled Kongs, though, so if you give me one of those I'll be a very happy boy! Overall I'm a sweet, goofy boy who just wants a family that will show me love and is willing to continue my training. If you are interested in adopting me, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please fill out an adoption application at https://freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org Dutch is being fostered outside of Fayetteville.",

He is a very loving dog but he is also young and very active and would required an experienced owner - preferably one who knows the husky breed.  Since all huskies are runners he needs a yard enclosed with a six foot fence; and one large enough for him to run and get exercise.  Moses should be an only dog since he doesn't get along with a lot of other dogs.  There could be children in the home but not younger than 10 - 12 years of age because he is so strong.  Moses is up to date on all his vaccines and worming and we are getting him neutered before he is adopted.  He will make someone a wonderful companion - we just have to find someone who understands the husky breed.  Moses is about 10 months old and weighs 50 pounds.  If interested please go to our website - www.hopeforhannahrescue.org - and submit an online application.  I will get back to you after I receive and process it.  He could be available for adoption the weekend of 1/29.",

So, finally, she was picked up as a stray and the 3rd owner didn't want to reclaim her since they couldn't keep her home without a fence.\n\nWe are really hoping that Luna's next home will be with someone who will truly love her and care for her properly.\n\nLuna is appx 1.5 years old, giving her an appx DOB of July 2019.  She weighs 75 lbs right now but will continue to fill out as she matures. She is heartworm and lyme negative.\n\nLuna is good with male dogs.  She should be the only female dog in the home. \nShe is going to do best in a home without cats or chickens.\nLuna has not been evaluated with children so no youngsters, please.\n\nTransport assistance within 1000 miles may be available depending on where you live and the availability of volunteer drivers along the route.\n\nPlease email for more information asdrescue@gmail.com\n",

He has done well in the prison but will be glad to move to a quieter environment.   He never did come to enjoy crowds.   Inside the house, he's quiet and loving.  Outside,  he perks right up.  As will most hounds,  a walk can quickly become an exercise in following his nose.   He's great with all the other dogs in the program.  GATOR is probably 4-5 years old.   He'll do well with a family who has the time to give to him.   A fence is a must.  If interested in adopting him,  our process begins with the application which can be found at www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.com",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.We are happy to announce that our sweet boy Casper is ready to find his forever home. Casper was surrendered by his Texas family when he needed them the most. He was a sick little man who needed medical attention and instead his family tuned him over to be euthanized. That was not going to happen if we had anything to say about that. When he arrived, Casper had a cough and in horrible need of a dental. His teeth were literally falling out of his mouth on the ride home from transport. We quickly made an appointment with our vet to help this spunky senior out. He had hair loss due to alopecia, a raging UTI, chronic bronchitis, and a fused spine. Not to mention that he suffers from mild seizures. Once many of his teeth were removed, we could tell Casper felt much better.\n\nAs you can tell Casper has a variety of medical issues and needs a home that is capable of providing him with his on going needs. He does need to remain on the steroids for life. As for the seizures, because they are so mild and infrequent he does not need medication at this time. Casper is a very happy, sweet, loving guy. He has spurts of energy where he just wants to play on your hand. He does enjoy sitting on the couch with you while watching TV or sleeping in a bed in front of the heat vent. This boy is full of kisses. Casper will sit there licking your hands or face for 20 minutes at a time. He gets along great with other dogs, but has no interest in playing with them. He would much rather sit on your lap or lay under a blanket with his favorite people. Casper sleeps in bed with his mama every night. He rarely wakes up to go outside. He is crate trained but he does not spend much time in it. During the day, while his foster family is at work, Casper will sleep away in his bed. They will leave him a potty pad to use if needed, but it is often dry when they get home. His foster family loves everything about him from his crazy hair, to his funny bark that reminds them of a pirate. They will be sad to see him leave but happy for him to call a home of his own. If you think you can provide the love and continued medical care he needs make sure you apply.\n\nCasper is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and tested neg. for heartworm. He was also given a dental! Casper's adoption fee is $100",

            "description": "MOOSE is a young adult male,  about a year old,  that was surrendered to the shelter.   He's a big strong pup and got to be too much for the family that got him as a puppy.   The obedience training he received from his inmate arrived in his \"development\" just in time.   Behind all the energy is a loving, willing to please dog but his perfect family will have to know that until he matures a bit more,  he's still a big, strong puppy.   He'd be fine for older children,  too much for smaller ones.  If there's another dog in the home,  the perfect fit would be middle to younger in years and on the submissive side.  A fence is a must.  A family with flexible work hours is preferred as he'll tolerate a crate but for short periods.  If you're interested in adopting, our process begins with the application which can be found on our website www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.com",

            "description": "Martha May is a ten-year-old, 90-lb German Shepherd mix currently being fostered in Sarasota, FL (Sarasota County). She is a fantastic dog, has the sweetest demeanor and does not have a care in the world. She enjoys a good head scratch and will nuzzle you to say, \"More please!\" She does great with other dogs and gets along with cats. She loves a good chew toy and almost always has a ball in her mouth. While she plays well with others, she can also be protective of her toys when other dogs are around. She is working on not guarding her toys and releasing a toy when asked. Martha is an older girl, but she does not let her age slow her down. She enjoys going on walks and chasing lizards in the backyard. She walks well on the leash, comes when called, and sits when asked. She is currently working on her stay command. Martha is a nap queen and is perfectly content sleeping the day away at your feet or in her own bed. She does have a bit of arthritis in her back that makes her a little bit stiff and unstable after being stationary for an extended amount of time. She does not show signs of being in pain and once she gets moving her stability improves. Martha is currently on a joint supplement which helps. Martha can get a little excited about food and is working on taking food gently from the hand. Because of this, she would do best in a home without small children. Martha is heartworm positive and is undergoing treatment. She is adoptable but will not be moved into her forever home until she has completed treatment. Martha 90 lbs of pure love and is looking for a forever home that will fully love her in return. She is house trained, crate trained, and up to date on vaccines. As a senior, Martha's standard adoption donation is $250, but $150 for a senior adopter 65+ through our Seniors for Seniors program.",

            "description": "Willie is a lanky pup with golden short, soft hair. He has splashes of white including on his face and toes, floppy ears, a long tail, and the kindest brown eyes.\n Willie has earned a nickname of Gentleman Willie! His calm demeanor is so comforting. He is very low key and mostly enjoys being around people, but doesn't like to be the center of attention. Willie is shy, but warms up when you sit beside him or crouch next to him and give him head pats. Chin scratches are his favorite! \nWillie gets along great with his foster dog brother, although isn't much interested in playing yet. He does well around other dogs and seems to be more comfortable around them than he is with people at first.\nWillie's dog bed is his favorite part of the house. Most days you'll find him lounging in his dog bed, always with his paws crossed (see photos). \nHe is mostly house-trained and crate-trained. He goes outside to take care of his business, sniffs around for a few minutes, then comes back inside to the warm house. His favorite place to sleep is his dog bed. We crate him when we're away from the house for a few hours. Otherwise, Willie does not need to be crated during the day, as he roams the house without any issues. \nMorning times are when he's most full of energy! He runs around in circles and wags his tail vivaciously (check him out in the video from Christmas morning!).\nWillie is learning to walk on a leash and has made such big improvements as we've worked with him! He is scared of loud noises, like cars driving by. Following IARs shy dog protocol is key to his success: We recommend using a double-leash method when walking Willie: one leash on his collar and one leash on his harness or a slip lead. Having two leashes will ensure he remains in your care even if gets spooked during his walk. He gets more and more brave every day! \nWillie isn't a high energy dog, so he would be happy with an apartment or a house. Because of his fear of loud noises, Willie would love a quiet environment to call home so he is able to relax more easily and come out of his shell.\n If you're looking for low-key companion, Willie is your guy!\n Willie came into IAR from a rural shelter.\n Read more about Willie on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-221/.",

She currently weighs under 15lbs.  She play swell with other dogs and loves to play with squeaky toys.  She is very snuggly. \n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption.

            "description": "I'm a 2 year old, 14 pound, Chihuahua looking for my best forever friend. Here's what we know so far!\n\nI'm still getting used to my surroundings at the moment with my new foster, and my personality hasn't felt safe to shine through yet. What I can tell you is that I'm timid around these new giants. I am sweet when I feel relaxed. I get along with the household cat. I'm still working on my bathroom manners, but have made lots of progress in the past few days. I do okay in a crate, but if you have to leave me, I prefer a more open space like a bathroom.\n\nI've had a few hiccups in my past that has lead me to a mild case of heartworms, but don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds. I'm on the mend and I have a dedicated team to get me all better again.\n\nI'm quiet. I don't have a lot to say and I don't take up much room. I just want to snuggle up and get belly rubs. What can I say?? I'm the perfect companion!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

Mila can be shy when first meeting new people, but she warms up quickly to kindness and patience. She is working on walking on the leash, but she's a bit unsure of having tight collars around her neck. Mila is making progress with harness training every day. Mila has lived with other dogs and small children. She would do fine living with either, given proper introductions. Mila would do best in a home without cats, as she does have a strong prey drive. Mila would make a wonderful companion for any confident, active person looking for a canine buddy. Contact Pet Helpers at 843-795-1110 to meet Mila!",

This young lady (2 years) has had a tough start in life but she has managed to not only survive but excel. Luna is extremely bright, highly focused, very loving, loyal to a fault and totally committed to her person. \n\nOur girl is very well trained in behavioral commands, she great on the leash a superbly house trained. Luna performed very well in all aspects of our socialization and training programs. Her training has revealed a very high intelligence, an affinity for training, very good social skills with adults and well behaved dogs. Luna's training also revealed a less than infinite patience with highly active toddlers, also revealed is a solid resistance to being dominated by other large dogs. The things said, this great girl would thrive in a house of adults with well-behaved dogs. As a trainer and handler I have found Luna to be very affectionate, very easy to train and a pleasured to be around.\n\n<strong>About Our Rescue</strong>\n\nWhether you adopt through Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Organization or any other similar organization, the LEAST we can do is thank you from the bottom of our hearts for considering welcoming these deserving dogs into your hearts and home.

We appreciate that you want to help make a difference in the lives of dogs who need us most!!! RESCUE ROCKS!\n\n<b><i>Disclaimer: Please note that the breeds posted on our dogs' biographies are our best guess based on years of working with rescue dogs. Adopters who need to know the exact breed or mix of breeds of a particular dog must have the dog's DNA tested at their own expense.</i></b>\n\n<center><b>To see more photos of this dog and all our adoptable dogs,<br>please check out our website at <a href=\"http://rescuedogvillage.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Dog Village</a></b>.</center>\n\nRESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5013C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n\nOUR DOGS ARE MICRO-CHIPPED AND READY TO BE PART OF YOUR FAMILY TODAY!\n\nThese dogs deserve all of our attention, and in Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Organization, we are committed to our adopters and our dogs equally. We offer full disclosure and hope to make the best matches possible. Please know our adoption fees never cover our expenses.

We owe it to the dogs we rescue and all the wonderful families/adopters who might consider welcoming our charges into their hearts and home. Our dogs are waiting for that ideal forever home where they will be cherished as deserving family members. It's sad these second chances are even necessary for these dogs, but we are committed to them and will devote the time and energy to their re-homing, and not just move them to save more dogs. We diligently and responsibly seek good matches, as we don't want to re-home the dog again. These animals have already endured more than they should have, and through no fault of their own. It behooves us to be honest and forthright, and we appreciate the same in return from applicants. It's that winning combination of reciprocal trust and respect that allows for successful placements to be made. Happy adopters translate to happy dogs, and that's our goal! \n\n\n",

Although he was sick, had mange and ringworm the staff fell in love with his personality and now after 2 months he is finally ready for his furever home! Ringo is a wiggle worm of happiness, his entire body participates in the wiggles! Once he settles down he is very good on his leash and he is more than happy to sit when he knows he will get a treat. He likes to explore his surroundings and is good with children, he will give kisses if you want him to and enjoys a good rub down so that he can wiggle some more. Let us know if you would like to give this great guy a new home. By the way, he likes other dogs but does NOT like CATS :(",

This handsome boy was found as a stray so not much is known about his history or training yet, but he seems great with other dogs and humans so far. The shelter who found him loved him and he's just a goofy, good boy based on what we have seen so far. He is heartworm positive, so he will be receiving treatment in his foster home. As he settles in, we will be updating his profile to reflect his true personality. Don\u2019t be shy, if he seems like the boy for you, please apply!\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

If you have questions regarding adoption, please visit our website --> www.adoptionfirstanimalrescueky.com Please do not email us asking if the dog is available, if they are on pet finder. We will not respond to emails that can be answered on our website.\nHi. My name is Luka. I came to the rescue when I was 5 weeks old. I am now approx 6 months old. I had to leave my mommy because a bigger dog got too rough with me and hurt my eye. The doctor says it's all better now and I can see just fine. I'm your typical bully pup. I act like a big tough guy but deep down I am a big softie. I love to snuggle and play all day. I would love a family that loves to be outdoors and does lots of active things. I have a lot of energy and I get bored when I'm stuck in the house. I don't always behave myself when I get too bored. Often times, I like to pester the cats. My foster mom isn't too happy when I do that. What can I say, it's fun and I don't hurt them. They like to run around just like me and I can't resist the urge to chase them. My momma says I'm real smart boy too. I already know how to sit and give her my paw when she tells me to. I am working on potty training. I get too distracted and just can't hold it. I'm getting better and I'm sure I will stop having accidents in the house soon. I'm a quick learner. Anyhow, I would love to find my forever family. If you have space in your home and heart for a cute guy like me, I'd love to join your family!!\n\nComplete Application\n\nYou must complete the adoption application in full to be considered for adoption. \n\nHome Check\n\nAll adoptions do require a home check. If you are not comfortable with a home check please do not apply. We want to ensure the safety of our dogs and to make sure the adoptive family is comfortable. \n\nMeet and Greet\n\nIf your application has been approved we will schedule a meet and greet for the dog of your choice or for a few we think might be a good fit for your family. \n\nSign Adoption Contract\n\nThis must be read and signed prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption Fee \n\nOnce everything has been reviewed the adoption fee will need to be paid. Puppies under 6 months is $300, over 6 months is $250, over 10 years is $150. Adoption fee includes: -Spay or Neuter -Microchip (additional registration fee required to transfer ownership to adopters) -Up to date on vaccinations -All animals have been examined by a veterinarian ** All adoption fees are non refundable.",

A real lover of life, Sammy is an exuberant soul when it comes to play and affection. Our volunteers are working on his leash skills ... he will benefit from some basic obedience training. He is only around 1 1/2 years old (est. birthdate 6/19) and weighs in the mid-fifties. Please check back for updates as we get to know him better. Visit STAF.org for more information on our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions. You will be asked to return for at least one follow-up visit, then take the dog home for a trial period before officially adopting. \n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

You don't need to email asking if they are available. \nThe crucial first step is to fill out an application @www.camorescue.com\n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nMeet Lilly!  Lilly is a 2-3 year old silky yorkie weighing 15lbs.   She will work well with a family that will have  patience to earn her trust. She will gravitate quicker to kids and will be fine with or without other dogs.  She is crate and potty trained, she is a quiet dog and does not bark a lot.  She loves her daily walks and loves to sleep in her crate next to her person.\n\nAdoption fees are variable.

But I have a secret, and a story that sets me apart from the other dogs here at Lost Our Home. You have to promise not to tell anyone. This is strictly CLASSIFIED stuff. Here's the deal... I am a real life time traveler. But I don't know HOW I got here to 2021, or why my time machine won't take me back to where I came from.\n\nOnce upon a paw, far away and long ago, I was just a sweet innocent young pup living my life, the world was my oyster! I was the most pup-ular girl in the neighborhood, shared dinners with the likes of Andy Warhowl, Bark Twain, and even the infamous Droolius Caesar. Ah, life was simpler back then. And then, out of NOWHERE, one day I woke up on the street, with these things called CARS whizzing by, and people wearing muzzles on their faces, and holding weird square boxes up to their ears instead of looking at each other! Ever since that day I've had a pretty ruff time. Thankfully, I know how to keep up a pawsitive attitude and make the most of things.\n\nYou will find me waiting pretty and proper with my favorite little teddy bear in my mouth. It's the only thing I have with me still from my old life and it brings me comfort. I love my toys and I sure love to show them off, I really don't think it's too much to ask for a family to spoil me with lots of toys (squeaky ones) and affection because I am a silly pup stuck in a big girl body!! \n\nI'd love to be your one and only pet, I'm not the best at sharing the spotlight. This new age world has some crazy things that really scare me, like TVs, vacuums, and dishwashers. But you can't blame me, I'm not even from this century! I'm a simple dog who needs a slow introduction to these fast-changing times! I love my kennel because it helps me feel safe at night, and I am very much potty trained in a home. I get anxious when left alone, but that's just because I have a love for people that LOVE ME.\n\nIf you are looking to open your heart to once in a LIFETIME pet who can share the secrets of the past with you, while we walk hand in paw into the future together, please take the time to apply to meet me! I can't wait for the op-paw-tunity to meet you!\n\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip with free chip registration\n--Free wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet\n \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online. You can also email us at adoptions@lostourhome.org.",

            "description": "Rocky is 3 years old and weighs 60lbs.\nRocky is a very smart boy, learns fast, and responds well to positive praise. He wants to please his people and will if you show him what you expect. He is good with other dogs and enjoys playing with them and going for walks with them. He knows his basic commands. He does pull on leash when he sees something he wants, usually another dog he wants to say hello to. \nRocky can get excited when he sees you and jump up, but will immediately stop when reminded its not good manners. He needs an owner willing to exercise him and play fetch to drain some of his energy. Daily walks would be great. He loves to jog and is great at keeping the pace of the person he is running with. Once he has been exercised he is happy to just hang out with his people.\nRocky lives with two other dogs in his foster home and does well with them. He does however have a tendency to guard his food bowl from them if it is left out after eating. The remedy is to remove the bowl and he will forget about it. He needs structured feeding time where he eats, then the bowl is put away until it is time to eat again. He does take treats nicely with the other dogs when his foster has them all sit and take turns. He takes treats very gently from his human and doesn't show any aggression.\nRocky is vaccinated, microchipped, and neutered. He is house trained and will use a crate if needed. He would love an active home where he is included in the activities. He needs a fully fenced yard with a standard 6ft fence. We suggest middle aged children and older, no cats. \nIf you think you can offer Rocky the stable home he deserves please submit an application to www.takemehomedogrescue.org",

She is now ready for adoption! She is very sweet and friendly, would love to live in someone's house and be a couch potato. She's overly attentive to our cats and small dogs but has not attempted to hurt them. It would be best if she was in a home as an only dog or with other dogs her size. She is eight years old and just wants to relax and enjoy her senior years in a home being loved the way she deserves to be. \n\nAll adult dogs are spayed/neutered, have a rabies certificate, vaccinations, heartworm negative and are dewormed. Puppies are vaccinated and dewormed and will come with a voucher for spay/neuter and final shots. When you adopt you will make a donation to help defray the cost of that expense. You must fill out and application and become a member of True Blue Animal Rescue in order to adopt. Email help@t-bar.org for more information.",

He is 2 years old and heartworm negative, and his adoption fee includes his neuter and microchip. If interested, please call the shelter at 281-403-8707 to schedule an appointment and/or request an application.  If you have specific questions, you can e-mail mc.rescueme@gmail.com, but we *cannot* schedule an appointment by e-mail or from a message on this page - you must call the shelter for a meet and greet.\n\nWe have transport options, but only to homes without other pets (because we have no way to make sure our dogs are compatible with your pets). We are in the Houston area but can transport to most of Texas, Washington State, Oregon, Maine, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Ohio. If you live somewhere else and are interested in adopting, just ask, and maybe we can work out alternative arrangements. Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions.",

I might be a shepherd mix. With all the changes that have went on in my life lately, I'm confused and scared of everything but I'm trying really hard and in a short amount of time I've opened up alot to my foster parents and foster fur-siblings.\n\nI am looking for a calmer, quieter home with a loving, patient family that will give me the time and attention I need to adjust to my new family, routines, smells, sounds and environment. An active family will do after I have settled in and have gained your trust. I think I will do best in a home with other other dogs to teach me not to be so scared of everything and how to be a good doggy. Because I like to run away from things I'm scared of, I will need a physical fenced in yard to play in and burn off my puppy energy. I just want to be loved.\n\nwww.dashanimalrescue.org\nDashrescue00@gmail.com",
