Update: Bonnie's fee has been partially sponsored by Dennis and Nadine and will be reduced to $50 plus tax. Meet Bonnie! This girl is best described as enthusiastic in everything she does.  Bonnie was surrendered to us because she was too much for her previous owner.  She was too strong and too energetic for her.  Bonnie knows some basic commands.  She is housetrained but crated or kenneled when left alone because she likes to chew.  She very seldom has accidents in the home when supervised.  Bonnie is good with other dogs  but too much for cats.  Bonnie can be jumpy and mouthy but with direction and adequate exercise she does better.  She loves to play with kongs, toys and play in the water.  She does need some work on leash pulling but Bonnie is very smart and should do well with a good leader and consistency.  Bonnie did well on her dog test here too.  She can be a bit much but she does everything with enthusiasm so if she has an owner that can channel her energy and teach her obedience, the skies the limit with her.  Bonnie would be best in a home with older kids.  If you are interested in meeting Bonnie, apply at www.cchswi.org  \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by \n a vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection.  If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

I am a super sweet and loving and may need a little extra time to adjust to my new home and surroundings. Once I am comfortable, you will see what a fun loving and energetic boy I am. Please understand that I am still a puppy that has a lot of energy and will need a home that is able to provide me with daily excersise, training and ongoing socialization. I would also benefit from force free training that will help me learn proper manners. I will need help with my house training, so please be patient with me, the staff have been working with me and I'm doing pretty good, but, I still need some guidiance. I should be fine in a home with children of all ages as long as we are monitored, but I would first love to meet them to ensure that we a good fit. When you are unable to supervise me, it is highly recommended by the staff that I am crate trained, this will help keep me safe. I know that when you meet me, you will fall in love with me, but please remember I am a life long commitment. I am patiently waiting for my furever home...Is it you? My adoption fee is $350 that helps with the cost of my care. Please also note that I am up to date on my age appropriate vaccinations and should meet my new veterinarian within 2 weeks of my adoption to ensure that I remain healthy and keep on a regular vaccination schedule. If your are interested in adopting me or another homeless pet at Macomb County Animal Control, please complete an application at the link below and an adoption counselor will be in contact with you. https://animalcontrol.macombgov.org/AnimalControl-AdoptionApplication",

            "description": "Hello my name is Luna! I am a girl that is out of this world! I have alot of energy and love to run and learn! I have been to doggy playgroup and have a very rough playstyle. My ideal family would consist of very active adults only. I would make an excellent running partner! I need a family that is willing to work with me and devote time to ongoing training. I have been in foster with the shelter's Animal Enrichment Manager. I ended up with her because I displayed some behavior problems that needed more work than could be done in the shelter environment. Even though I am still young I would not be a good fit for a first time dog owner. I have a special adoption procedure because of my behavior quirks and will not be a first come, first served adoption. Please fill out an application if I would be a good fit for your family! Once we approve your application my foster mom will give you a call to talk about me. If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $175.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) All dog adoptions come with free leash and collar.",

So energetic that its unable to say if it's excitment or aggression. I know he was very nice when he first came in so I want to lean that he's just being overly excited to see someone but I'm not completely convinced. Need more information and to observe him more. ml 01/21/21 Update: 01/20/21 13:22 Took out to play yard. Dog leashes easily and walks well on leash. Stop to smell others dogs as we passed by, no aggression. Dog knows the sit command and will sit for treats. * Use caution when giving treats, mouthy. I would just toss treats to him. Not very interested in toys or playing catch. JS 01/20/21 14:34 Removed from kennel to administer treatment, animal is very gentle walks well on leash. He allowed treatment very easily without any issues, happy boy wags tail, very calm SMS MEDICAL NOTES: 01/18/21 08:08 Dog has few issues. Right eye looks swollen and has green discharge.

            "description": "Hi, my name is SHORTIE and I would love to meet you. I am a Neutered Male Staffordshire Bull Terrier and English Bulldog. The shelter staff think I am about 5 years old. I have been at the shelter since Jan 25, 2021. Meet Shortie! This little meatball came to the shelter as a stray, so shelter staff and volunteers are still getting to know him. Personality: Shortie is the sweetest boy you`ll ever meet! Despite his goofy self, he loves to sit on your lap and get lots of cuddles! His favorite trick is to sit and he is very treat motivated and would love to learn more tricks with you! History: Shortie has shown some reactivity and stiff-body language towards other dogs while at the shelter, so he would prefer to be your one-and-only fur baby (more cuddles for him)! Energy levels: He may be compact, but he is one energetic dude! Shortie is just a bundle of joy! He would love to go on short walks with you around the block and snuggle with you afterwards! Ideal home: This little man has a LOT to say, so he should not go home to apartment-style living (apt, duplex, condo, etc). Ideal family: Shortie is a silly guy, who is sure to make you laugh and keep you on your toes! Because he is a bit of a `wild child,` children in the home should be OLDER, to be able to understand his body language and stay standing when he throws his weight around. All the children in the household should be present for a meet and greet with this guy! Are you ready for this little snorter? Come down and meet him today!",

I am a very sweet gentleman who takes treats nicely and absolutley loves peanut butter! I can be shy when meeting new people, but if you have food we will be well acquainted with each other in no time. *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

Skipper is overly friendly, playful, and exuberant.  He is good with other dogs and likes to play.  He is very friendly with humans and leaps happily off the ground to meet new friends.  Skipper would benefit from a positive reinforcement training class to work on his manners and obedience.  He is crate trained, seems to be house trained, and is working on his leash manners.  Skipper will need lots of physical exercise to stay happy.  He is a big dog and should not live with toddlers due to his jumping.\n\nAdoption fee: $300\nBirthday: 1/2019\nWeight: 65 lbs.",

            "description": "Meet Scout! Scout is looking for a home that is ready to do some work with him on his socialization. Scout is about 2.5 years old, fully vetted, and he weighs 72 pounds. Scout was in his previous home since he was 6 weeks old, but he was surrendered to us due to his behavioral and social issues. Scout seems to have some fear based reactions with women, children, and strangers and would really benefit from working with a trainer to get through those fears. His previous family told us that he does well with other dogs and he had not been around cats. Scout had been living with a young kid in the home for quite some time but the day after he was neutered he snapped at the kid and was brought to the shelter to keep the kid safe. Scout was described as a great dog prior to this incident though and we believe that in the right home that is willing to help him through this, he will be a wonderful companion! He is potty trained, knows basic commands, and he loves to ride in the car. Scout has been around sheep and goats and did well with them but he does seem to chase small animals like squirrels and rabbits. Scout loves to get outside and go for walks but he does tend to pull on the leash when he is excited and could use a little bit of leash training in his new home. He was described as friendly, playful, outgoing, high energy, and protective. If you would like to meet Scout give us a call to set up an appointment!",

She is friendly, playful, and oh so affectionate! Sarah doesn't understand how big she is sometimes, so older kids with prior dog experience, or a home without kids, would be best. She would also do best as the only dog in the house. It is unknown how she would do with cats.\n\nSarah has hip dysplasia in her right hip. This means that the ball of her femur does not sit in the socket of her hip joint. We have put her on joint supplements and pain medication to keep her comfortable. In the future, she may need a procedure to remove the head of her femur to prevent rubbing and pain (FHO - femoral head ostectomy). Keeping her slim, staying on arthritis and pain medication, and daily gentle exercise will keep her in the best shape until surgery is needed.\n\nAn experienced owner who can keep Sarah as comfortable and pain-free as possible is necessary. If this is you, please give us a call to learn more. Meets by appointment only. Call to schedule a meet. 518-885-4113.",

            "description": "Feeling a bit blue? A little lonely? Is it getting dark a bit too early? Bright can fix all of that - he's a beam of love and light in dog form! Bright came to CCR after his owners were unable to care for him anymore. He's a 7 1/2 year old Great Dane/pittie mix who tips the scales at 83 pounds. Despite his beefiness, Bright thinks he's a lap dog! He loves to snuggle and cuddle, and nothing makes him happier than some love time. Bright is your typical elephant-who-sees-a-mouse scaredy cat - he can be worried going for walks in new environments or when he hears big new sounds! Once he's comfortable, this guy LOVES to go for walks in the woods, sniff around under the snow, and then come home to a roaring fireside snooze! Bright is currently living in a foster home where is foster mama says he's just a doll! Because of his tough early life, Bright has some issues sharing his stuff with other dogs, so he'll need to be the only dog in the home. He does fine with dog-savvy cats - he's living with two now! We're looking for a low-key suburban or rural home where Bright can stretch his legs without the noise and stress of city living. He's a low-key, mellow adult guy who wants a low-key, mellow home where he can finally have the love and security he deserves. Bright isn't comfortable with young children.\n\nTo meet Bright, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

You see, I'm a 2-year-old Pit Bull Terrier/Cane Corso mix who somehow ended up at The New Albany Floyd County Animal Shelter when my previous owner was moving and couldn't take me with them. I'm looking for some place to call my very own kingdom and I was hoping that you would come along and make my dreams come true! I'll repay you by letting you walk me, feed me, and tell me I'm pretty. I guess I'll also give you some kisses and cuddles but only if I deem you worthy. I'm a little picky on who I want to live with so if I could meet everyone who will be under my rule before taking over your castle, that would be just wonderful! I will probably be too much for small children. I'm pretty smart (if I do say so myself), I love to run with the other dogs here at the shelter, and I'll keep you on your toes! I've never met whatever a \"cat\" is but they sound like I may be too tempted to chase them. They tell me I'm already spayed, micro-chipped and up to date on vaccinations. You can drive me to your home for just $80 (plus applicable licensing fees) so if that strikes your fancy head on over to nafcanimalshelter.org to fill out an application.",

My name is Maya. I am a Cane Corso pup approximately 8 months old. Would you like to know my story? It doesn\u2019t start out great like most rescues, but thankfully I know the best life is on its way. You see I am officially a part of WTWTA Rescue and they take loving rescue kids like me and my sisters pretty seriously.   \n\nSo, my journey began when my sisters and I were found along a country road dumped off by our previous owners. I know what your thinking, how could somebody abandon beautiful kids like us\u2026sadly this happens more often then it should. My sisters and I decided to stick together while we were off fending for ourselves near the woods. cause that\u2019s what sisters do.  We were better as a pack than separated from one another. Thankfully a Good Samaritan who knows mastiffs saw us and picked us up. They were diligent about where we would be placed and who they would allow to rescue us so we could be kept safe. We arebeyond grateful for that.  \n\nYou see being an italian mastiff breed, we are a pretty \u201cBIG\u201d deal!\u2026.see what I did there :P So they contacted WTWTA who knows kids like us well and are specialized in placing our breeds in the right home. Since being a part of WTWTA we are learning what it feels like to be loved. They took us to get vaccinated. I was nervous at first going to the vet\u2019s, but quickly overcame that and did well. I received all the necessary vaccinations and tests.  \n\nLet me tell you I have the most guardian spirit out of my sisters. So It will take me a minute to feel safe and not be on gaurd around humans. However, when I let you in I will give you all of me and sleep in your arms like a baby. When I went to get vaccinated, they arranged for a driver for me. I know what you\u2019re thinking, a girl like me should have a chauffeur. Well, that\u2019s what I thought too. On the way to the vet I was mesmerized by how fast everything was moving. I didn\u2019t want to miss it. While riding, my driver introduced me to Broadway musical but I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m more of a country and Today\u2019s hits kind of gal. What really made me like country was when my driver played \u2018Forever Girl\u2019 by Jon Langston. My favorite line was \u201cshe\u2019s everything in my whole world, that\u2019s my forever girl.\u201d It gave me hope to know I will be someone\u2019s forever girl someday soon.\n\nAfter our adventurous drive they arranged for me to have a spa day! Talk about rolling out the red carpet. While in the tub I liked to play a game called \u201cCan you keep me in here?\u201d I won the first round but my stylist was the champ. Can you keep a secret between you and I? I\u2019m actually happy my stylist won. To be treated with such care felt luxurious. I am a luxury kind of lady. Then shortly after I showed off my quick ability to snatch their food off the counter within seconds. They didn\u2019t even know it was gone. I blamed it on my sister. Suckers!\n\nI am still working on potty training and leash training, so you will have to be patient. I am still coming into who I am, and it may take me a while to completely open up and adjust. I am unsure about other dogs and would need some time and folks to go slow with introductions. So if you currently have another dog, we would need to do a meet up to ensure we like each other. I am not sure about small animals so no cats or smalls breeds. I would prefer a nice fenced in yard to play in since I am a giant breed I need room to run! If your wanting a pup with unconditional love then you came to the right place :) \n\nIf you are interested in Maya please list her in your adoption application.",

At just over a year, he still has some puppy tendencies, like mouthing, but he is quickly learning how to be a good boy in his foster home. Tony understands \"drop it\" and \"leave it\". He has almost mastered house training, and he's doing well with crate training. On walks, Tony only pulls when he sees something interesting. Some of Tony's favorite activities include running, playing with toys, and fetching his ball!

Has played well with other dogs, but not lived with them.\n\nIntake Reason: Owner Surrender for moving, no pets.\n\nMore About this Pet: My name is Maya and I am a happy little wiggleworm! In my last home my favorite pastimes were chewing on bones and getting epic zoomies! I am already crate trained and housebroken and I even lived with a cat. I was curious about him and he tolerated me just fine. I'm a little bit of a diva and I love to model for the camera. See my dazzling smile? I could use a little more work building confidence in new situations and when meeting new people. Sometimes I get a little nervous, but if you have treats, I'll warm up fast and be your best friend. I'm a good girl who would do well in any home that has patient humans who like to play!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting this pet, click the [Adopt me] button to apply. \nFind a link to adopt this pet on our website: https://www.mdspca.org/humane-care/adopt/ \n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 48.6lbs Age: 1yrs 6mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

Who is smart, curious and playful? Who would be happy both on long rambling walks and as a couch potato sidekick? Meet Bridget -she is a love bug and never misses a chance for a cuddle. She is quiet, well-mannered, and loves affection. She is housebroken, and has stayed alone for up to four hours with no problem. Her foster mom reports that she has the run of the main floor and has been a lovely guest. She is a great eater, takes treats nicely, doesn't beg (too much), and sits patiently for the leash. She sleeps by herself (on a comfy chair) all night without any problem. And did we mention she is adorable?\n\nBridget is a strong and confident girl, but she can be fearful of new people (particularly adult males). She needs practice at learning to trust strangers and be less protective of her loved ones. Bridget has been practicing with good success on meeting guests outside at her foster's house (socially distanced of course) and has already made great strides in a short time. Bridget also needs some improvement in her lease manners -especially when she sees other dogs.\n \nBecause of Bridget's tentative nature around strangers and her strong protective instinct, she would do best in an adults only home. Bridget is waiting patiently to meet her forever humans!",

            "description": "Go go go go! That's my middle name! As you probably guessed from my breed, I am a wicked smart, high energy, fun and loving companion who is ready to wiggle my way into your heart! Wanna get moving and get more exercise? I'll make sure of that! Wanna cuddle buddy on the couch to keep you safe during scary movies? I'm down for that too! Whatever adventure you want to take, I'm your girl! Hikes in the woods, kayaking, long runs, hunting, fishing, let's go go go! \n\nSome facts that you may want to know about me...I am 40 lbs & the vet thinks I am \"full grown\". I am smart and know these commands & obey them \"almost\" all the time: sit, come, hold/wait, lay down, shake a paw/high five, inside, up, gentle. Oh & of course \"TREAT\"... my personal favorite. I am still working on: no jump, off, walk easy & stay. I am good in a crate and I would never think to potty in the house! \n\nI would do best in a home with a patient owner who understands my breed characteristics and wants to help me learn the manners that will help me be the best lady that I can be. An owner who understands that at just 9 months old, I am still very puppy! I am super smart and trainable, so don't think I'm a dummy....that's not ignorance showing, it's just my stubborn streak. I would love love an energetic doggie play friend who loves to play as much as I do! I love older/senior dogs too, but they don't love me so much. My energy and desire to play will probably drive them crazy. Got kids? Great, they can run and throw the ball with me! Got kitties? Well, I've never met one of those, so I don't really know if I like them or not. But, I am sure I'll like you! Just fill out an application at www.pawsitivetailskc.org, and come see if you like me too!",

They were informed that there were 2 pit puppies, my sister and I, abandoned outside of our room, left in our kennels, overnight on the coldest night of the year. Thankfully the motel employees put us back inside the room where we had been kept and began to adamantly contact WTWTA Rescue and called and called till they reached someone. When WTWTA came to check on our situation they realized we had not been fed or watered properly in days. The motel room was covered in our own feces because no one was taking us out to potty. We had to drink our own urine to try and get hydrated. Our mother had completely abandoned us and left us hungry and freezing to death. \n\nThankfully, WTWTA Rescue immediately took us into their foster care program where we would be kept safe and warm until our quarantine period was up. While there we met a friend who went in quarantine with us. Her name is Marty you can read her story and bio on this website too. Let me tell you, those first couple nights we kept our foster mom hustlin with how much we ate and pottied. We are just so grateful to be alive! \n\nThey think im about 4-5months old. Im the twin sister of Luke. Although my brother and I were left unable to fend for ourselves in the cold, we are survivors. We look at the brighter things life has to offer and you will notice that about me in my sparky and happy personality. Now, to the essentials\u2026have you heard about this thing, I think you humans call it cuddling??\u2026..Well I love it! It is one of my all-time favorite things to do. Affection is my favorite, I will shower you with kisses. Affection, makes me feel like I\u2019m loved and cared for and like I\u2019m worth all the good things life has to offer. I\u2019m not as active as my brother but I do I enjoy practicing tricks. I like to show off how smart I am and I want my person to know I am here to listen to them. I am also considering opening my own business. Lola\u2019s cuddle club will be the name. I\u2019m hoping my cuddles will enhance other\u2019s lives each and every day. If you pick me I will love you forever!\n\nIf you are interested in Lola please make a note in your adoption application",

They were informed that there were 2 pit puppies, my sister and I, abandoned outside of our room, left in our kennels, overnight on the coldest night of the year. Thankfully the motel employees put us back inside the room where we had been kept and began to adamantly contact WTWTA Rescue and called and called till they reached someone. When WTWTA came to check on our situation they realized we had not been fed or watered properly in days. The motel room was covered in our own feces because no one was taking us out to potty. We had to drink our own urine to try and get hydrated. Our mother had completely abandoned us and left us hungry and freezing to death. \n\nThankfully, WTWTA Rescue immediately took us into their foster care program where we would be kept safe and warm until our quarantine period was up. While there we met a friend who went in quarantine with us. Her name is Marty you can read her story and bio on this website too. Let me tell you, those first couple nights we kept our foster mom hustlin with how much we ate and pottied. We are just so grateful to be alive! \n\nThey think I\u2019m about 4-5 months old. My favorite past time is to play tug of war and go for walks. I like to think I am an undefeated champion of tug of war\u2026.if you doubt me feel free grab and rope and give it a go its my favorite. I\u2019m always up for a good challenge. I am quite an active boy. What do you say we head out on some adventurous and see the world together. I also, enjoy being in the most advantageous spot of the room. It gives me a sense of confidence and security to find the highest perch and watch over my foster fam. This way I have eyes on everything and everyone. Nothing is getting passed these keen eyes I\u2019m a true guardian. My foster parents work with me to do tricks. Yea, yea, I\u2019ll do the trick but only for the treat. I\u2019m smart you know. I know what I need to do for some extra licky chewys. Who doesn\u2019t like getting a treat? As you can see I am quite the sweet, confident, and smart young man. I will be your best companion if you let me!\n\nIf you are interested in Luke please make a note in your adoption application",

He certainly did enjoy time out of the shelter, and was able to smell all kinds of new scents on top of the snow. However it didn't take long for him to decide the shelter was fine as he has a very warm, thick mat on top of his Kuranda bed. We are hoping Clifford's family will come looking for him. He is extremely healthy, not a hunting dog, and is completely housetrained. If he is your dog, please call the shelter at 434-821-4416.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This pet has been posted by Friends of Campbell County Animal Control, Rustburg, VA. For questions about the pet, please email us at FOACinfo@gmail.com. All adoptions begin with an application, found under the \"Animals\" tab on our website, friendsofcampbellcounty.org. *Unaltered babies under the age of six months can be adopted only to residents of Campbell County, the City of Lynchburg, and counties touching Campbell County. *Unaltered adult pets six months or older will need to be sterilized before they can be adopted outside our local area of Campbell County, the City of Lynchburg, or counties touching Campbell. *We do not promote dog adoptions to homes where an invisible fence is the fencing of choice. *We do not permit cats or kittens to be declawed following adoption.",

My ID number is 335823\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Gemma! Bonded with Remmington 335822\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.

This has not prevented this 3yr old Tennessee Lab mix from being a loving dog with people. He has been a happy dog for us to foster but we did find that that years on the chain has made him unfriendly with other dogs. This happens so often with chained dogs and is not their fault. You could not find a happier more people oriented dog than Teddy!! He enjoys car rides and hikes and walks very well on a leash. He is housebroken and loves his crate, and goes in on his own for a nap. Teddy does require a home with no other animals as he was never properly socialized while on the chain. Children over 10yrs old would be best due to his size. If you are interested in giving Teddy a dream come true happily ever after life, please email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

He's very playful and friendly with both animals and people, but needs animal friends who are comfortable with high energy dogs who like to play rough. He's crate trained but, at his age, has a lot of puppy energy and will need some work on his manners (jumping and leash pulling). Jack is very good friends with one of our dogs in foster, helping him to train and get his energy out, so we'd love for them to continue playdates after his adoption. His adoption fee is $395 which includes him being neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines. If you're interested in adopting, please fill out an application at sftsrescue.org!\n\n*** Shelter From The Storm is currently closed to the public and adoption meetings are only available to those who have an approved application. Out of state applicants are welcome, but we are unable to assist in transportation and prefer that you live within 5 hours of us.",

The shelter I was at originally was pleading for funds for a rescue to take me in\u2026.and nobody bit but guess who showed up on their front porch to come save me? You guessed it WTWTA. I must say they are some pretty rad people for us long shots .  \n\nOnce WTWTA took me into their pack my life changed in a way I didn\u2019t think was possible. They didn\u2019t waste time. They immediately made an appointment for surgery to help remove my painful tumors (non-cancerous) with one of the best surgeons in the area. Now their gone I\u2019ve never felt better. What a weight off my shoulders\u2026.literally! Life is great! Now, I make people around me laugh with my grunt and snort sounds. They think I maybe 1/3 pig, 1/3 dog and 1/3 rhino \u2026because the way I move reminds them of a big rhino.\n\nWhen I want to be near you, I dig my front paws into the earth, bury my shoulders low to the ground, and truck to get to you like a happy rhino.  Although, I may be mixed with rhino, pit-bull, giant bearded dragons and who knows what else I\u2019m a super chill and loving pup that\u2019s as sweet as can be.\n\nI am fully vaccinated and neutered. I am, however, heartworm positive. That doesn\u2019t scare me though WTWTA knows how to take care of kiddos like me. I am great on a leash and will go where you lead me, unless I see something really fun or someone I love then Ill go excitingly in that direction like a baby rhino. Then I transform into a rhino hulk. I\u2019m good with small dogs. If I\u2019m being honest, I prefer humans over animals. I do not favor large alpha dogs. I like solid companions. \n\nSo If you\u2019re a laid-back lad or family that wants to chill and go on walks and snuggle on the couch I\u2019m your guy.  \n\nIf you are interested in Drax please make a note in your adoption application via our website noted above. \n",

            "description": "#579118Age: 3 years, 9 monthsWeight: 18 lbs How this pet arrived: This pet was brought in by their previous owner on December 9, 2020. Why this pet is the one for you:Are you looking for a pal with a personality as sweet as candy? Then you need to meet Jujubee! This little fellow is quite the cutie, and he's looking for an extra-special family willing to help him with his medical needs; Jujubee has a condition called Intervertebral Disk Disease (or IVDD for short) and has had some trouble using his back legs. Due to this ongoing disease, Jujubee is not a good candidate for a home with stairs, or a family looking for an active hiking/running partner. He has been improving wonderfully in our care, and his new family will need to speak with their veterinarian about a plan to keep him healthy and happy before adopting. In the past, Jujubee has gotten along well with respectful children, and with other small dogs; however, because of his condition, he'd rather watch the fun and games from the sidelines, rather than join in the action (if you're looking specifically for a playmate for another four-legged friend, Jujubee might not be the best match). So all that being said, do you think Jujubee might be the guy for you? If so, make an appointment to learn more today!

The owner readily surrendered her and they came to us as fast as we could find room.   The pups are all adopted and settling nicely in their new homes.   Now it's ZUZU's turn.   She adores people and seems to know a few basic commands.   When we found her she was very thin and chained up so we see signs of protecting her food - Not to be unexpected.   She'll make a wonderful companion for a family that has the time and patience to give her a proper life.  She is very willing.

These pups were born to a stray mama is a super poor, desolate area. Fortunately for them, an amazingly compassionate animal lover found them. She knew that where they lived their outcome would likely be poor, but she wanted to do everything she could to be a stepping stone to a life of greatness for each! She took them in and spoiled them with as much love as she could. She fed them not only dog food but she cooked for them and truly treated them as her babies! She snuggled and spoiled them and cherished every one of them, while simultaneously trying to create a plan for them to get a better life than where she was living would ever have to offer her. After several weeks of not finding a solution she felt great about, she reached out to us for help! Fortunately we had an amazing foster home available who was happy to help and be the next stepping stone to a great future! \nOnce we got them they went straight to the vets! The vet gushed about what chunky adorable happy babies they were! And agreed on the thought that they were likely black lab/Australian cattle dog blends of some kind. No matter what they are, they are definitely AMAZING!!! So purely sweet!\nIn Shaggys foster home he is a master snuggler- and so super smart! He is the best of all worlds! Eager to please, eager to snuggle, eager to play, and so adorable with GLORIOUS ears!!! He is a chunky, brilliant character who is absolutely irresistible! He would love a home with another dog, but it is not required! He loves all kinds of play and exploration and is sure to grow to be such a Velcro dog! He will follow you everywhere and be your best friend for life! He is such a happy, positive spirit and needs parents who are just like that! Living a beautiful life, full of love, happiness and adventure! \nIf this absolutely darling puppy is your dream come true, please visit our website and submit an application for adoption today!! www.greatdivideanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Blueberry is such a GREAT dog. In all situations, she is just wonderful, truly, once she knows you (tentative at first). She is only about 4 to 5 years old and 55 lbs of kisses and mush, once she warms up. Someone really messed up her ears, trying to get her to look mean, but she is anything but that. Her beautiful blue color and gentle nature will melt your heart. Blueberry is fearful of men, but no aggression at all. She loves other dogs and we can cat test. She is truly just a big mush who will steal your heart for sure. If you like this breed, you will LOVE Blueberry. So pretty in person. CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

Mojo is great with other dogs and cats and kids. Truly just a sweet pup in need of a forever home. Playful, smart, affectionate, and eager to please. So adorable in person and a must meet. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

We don't know her past but her future is bright. She is very friendly and loving with people but other animals cause her anxiety so she would need to be an only pet. She is a total people pleaser and looks for praise. Juliet is very intelligent and needs an active home, she would do best in a GSD experienced home to ensure she is never abandoned again. Juliet would love a house with  fully fenced in yard and someone home more often than not. She seems to be house trained and is crate trained. If you think you could give Juliet the forever home she deserves and craves, pleas fill out an application.\n\nwww.mobilemuttsrescue.org",

            "description": "Shadow is such a sweet, gentle, laid back, timid dog. He is 6 years old and 65 lbs of wonderful, but it takes him some time to warm up. He was dumped at a shelter, after supposedly chasing neighbors goats. We find this hard to believe, for his hips are not great and he just does not move fast enough, nor have the energy it takes, to chase goats! Poor excuse made up, for a guy who no longer wanted to keep his dog. Shadow does well with dogs, and we can cat test. He is gentle and calm and a bit reserved and timid, til he knows you. He is so confused as to what he is doing here. Poor guy seems so beaten down and as if someone was a real jerk to him, most all of his life! Please, open your hearts and homes to this wonderful boy - you will be so glad you did! He is very handsome in person and a real gentle soul. CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

            "description": "Shadow is such a sweet, gentle, laid back, timid dog. He is 6 years old and 65 lbs of wonderful, but it takes him some time to warm up. He was dumped at a shelter, after supposedly chasing neighbors goats. We find this hard to believe, for his hips are not great and he just does not move fast enough, nor have the energy it takes, to chase goats! Poor excuse made up, for a guy who no longer wanted to keep his dog. Shadow does well with dogs, and we can cat test. He is gentle and calm and a bit reserved and timid, til he knows you. He is so confused as to what he is doing here. Poor guy seems so beaten down and as if someone was a real jerk to him, most all of his life! Please, open your hearts and homes to this wonderful boy - you will be so glad you did! He is very handsome in person and a real gentle soul. (Fostered in PA - We do not text) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application. (If you email us and do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please try again, as we most likely did not receive your email!) (Also note that many of our dogs are fostered just across the border into PA)",

Mojo is great with other dogs and cats and kids. Truly just a sweet pup in need of a forever home. Playful, smart, affectionate, and eager to please. So adorable in person and a must meet. (Fostered in PA - We do not text) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application. (If you email us and do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please try again, as we most likely did not receive your email!) (Also note that many of our dogs are fostered just across the border into PA)",

Frankie LOVES people and the outdoors to no end.\nFrankie is one of our special medical cases as he was diagnosed with a strong heart murmur and needs medication for his condition. He is in very good spirits but will need to be seen by a veterinarian on a regular basis, and his exercise has to be monitored to prevent any further damage to his heart. His day-to-day life is pretty positive, and he doesn't act as if he has a heart condition, but potentially his life span can be cut short due to the severity of his murmur.\nHe does not seem reactive to other dogs but will need a mellow household due to his medical needs. Frankie seems to be fine being around cats, and we think he would be fine with children as well as long as they know not to rough house with him.\nThis sweet boy deserves all the love and care he receives and would make a great addition to any family who wants to make sure that this happy dog lives the remainder of his life in a good home.Please visit the following link on our website to learn about Second Chance's adoption process. http://www.2ndchanceanimalcenter.org/adoption.html",

He was worried I would get under his feet/walker and trip him. \n\nAfter bringing me to the shelter, the shelter veterinarian found that I have a continuous heart murmur that indicates I most likely have a congenital heart defect that is called a PDA or Patent Ductus Arteriosus. \n\nI am in need of a loving family that can take me in and have my heart evaluated by a veterinarian since the shelter does not have the equipment needed for this evaluation. \nI will need chest x-rays, an ECG and a Cardiac U/S to get a definitive diagnosis. I will also need to be evaluated by a surgeon for possible surgery or catherization procedure. \n\nWithout treatment I will live for only a few years depending on the condition of my heart and the progression of disease found during the evaluation.\n\nI am very sweet and cuddly and would love for a family to take me home and give me the best life I can have.

Poor guy had a history of untreated ear infections that we thought might lead to surgery, but the vet has him on ear drops that seem to be doing the trick!  He does great on the leash and loves to be outside!  He was kenneled with another dog at the shelter and did fine. He is unknown with cats. He does not need to be kenneled when left alone, he\u2019s potty trained and does great with free roam of the house.",

This sweet and energetic girl is ready to find her forever home. Kasha will be 3 years old in March and would love nothing more than to celebrate with her forever humans. She has never met a human she doesn't love, especially if they will play with her and give her belly rubs. Kasha did well at her vet visit and when she had a spa day at the groomer. She is such a social little butterfly! This girl would do best in home with older children, as her energy and excitement may knock little ones over. She does well with other dogs, but prefers to eat in her very own space as she becomes protective of her food. She loves romping and playing with her 4 foster fur-siblings, and would like to have a fur-sibling of her own in her forever home.\n\nIn typical border collie fashion, this girl is not only energetic, but she is also very smart! She walks well on a leash and knows basic commands of sit, down, off, and no. Although she is quick to learn, she is still working on her manners and will need ongoing support with this. She has been know to put her paws on the counter, but has learned this is not polite! She also loves to greet humans with a hug, she needs ongoing reminders that this is not polite nor welcomed by all humans she meets.\n\nThis young, active girl would love to find herself an active household. She would make a great jogging partner! Kasha requires a large fenced yard so she can show off her speed and her ball playing capabilities (chances are, her humans arm will become tired before she does!). She LOVES being outside, and needs a family who can spend lots of outdoor time with her.\n\nKasha is nearly 3 years old and weighs 45 pounds. She is house trained, crate trained and up to date with all vetting, including monthly preventatives. If you are interested in welcoming Kasha into your home, (and planning her upcoming birthday party!) please fill out an application.\n\nKasha is being fostered near Sedalia, MO.",

I'm the perfect best friend for you to tell all your secrets to and the best audience for you to practice your singing with, I'll even try to sing along!

I am shy at first but once I know you are an awesome human we are going to be the best of friends!\n\nI would love daily walks and love.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please go to www.ccrcdogs.com to fill out an application.\n\nWe do not have a facility for you to visit.\n\nWE PROCESS APPLICANTS AND SET APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THE ORDER APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED\n\n, so while you are welcome to email\nccrcdogs@ccrcdogs.com\nwith specific questions, you will want to complete the\n\nONLINE APPLICATION\n\nASAP\n\n,\n\nwhich can be found at www.ccrcdogs.com,\n\nto secure your position in line for one of our dogs. You can also find\n\na description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.",

            "description": "Name: Bronco\nBreed: Chihuahua mix (6 lbs)\nAge: 1year\nNeutered male\n\nBronco is a great little dog. He is shy at first but warms up once he gets to know you. He loves treats and snuggling. He'll wear outfits for you and play with toys. Due to the fact that his last owner had large Bengal cats (15-20lbs) that would fight him for his food he has some food and cat aggression. But his foster mom feeds him away from her normal sized cats and he's had no problems with them. So as long as he is fed away from other pets he does just fine. He is working on leash training and crate training. He still needs some house training.\n\nDUE TO THE FACT THAT THE VOLUNTEER IN CHARGE OF THE RESCUE EMAIL IS OUT WITH COVID PLEASE SEND ALL INQUIRIES TO THE THE DOG ADOPTION COORDINATOR JENNY AT foster.pups@yahoo.com\n\nAll of our dogs listed are in foster homes. Please email or call for price and more information on the gorgeous dog. Adoption fee includes spay/neuter and up-to-date shots. Adoption fees also help us buy food, medicine, and other expenses for our animals. If you have any questions, please contact Last Hope Cat Kingdom  at friends@lasthopecatkingdom.org.",

            "description": "Blueberry is such a GREAT dog. In all situations, she is just wonderful, truly, once she knows you (tentative at first). She is only about 4 to 5 years old and 55 lbs of kisses and mush, once she warms up. Someone really messed up her ears, trying to get her to look mean, but she is anything but that. Her beautiful blue color and gentle nature will melt your heart. Blueberry is fearful of men, but no aggression at all. She loves other dogs and we can cat test. She is truly just a big mush who will steal your heart for sure. If you like this breed, you will LOVE Blueberry. So pretty in person. (Fostered in PA - We do not text) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application. (If you email us and do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please try again, as we most likely did not receive your email!) (Also note that many of our dogs are fostered just across the border into PA)",

We told them we would help their beloved bc girl find a new, wonderful home.\nBetsy is about 9 yrs old and is a tiny, purebred border collie.  Like most bc's, she is shy when she first meets new people and, given the upheaval in her life, she will need a patient, understanding person.  She does fine with male dogs but does not want to share her home with another female dog.\nWhat Betsy would love the most is a home where she could get alot of love and attention.  \nShe is housebroken, up to date on shots and on heartworm prevention.  \nThere is no rehoming fee for Betsy but we all love this girl and her family and will be very selective for her.  We will require a fenced yard.\nIf you can offer Betsy a home, please email us at contact@bordercollierescue.com or complete an online application at www.bordercollierescuewesttn.org\n",

I love to go for walks and play ball in the yard. I want nothing more than to find my forever family where I can be the only pet and get all of your love!

He has lots of energy to go on nice walks, runs, hikes, or playing around the yard. He is a very friendly boy who loves getting snuggled and butt scratches. He will give you kisses in return for cuddles! He is a silly boy that loves to play. He may need some basic training skills once in a new home but seems like he is a people pleaser. We will require he meet any potential \"dog siblings\" before going home with him. If you think Boeing would be the perfect fit for you, please call for special adoption considerations, and fill out an adoption application and send it to adoptions@hsdayton.org so our staff can review it, and if approved, we will contact you about setting up a time to meet with him.",

Sweet, silly Teddy loves to play and cuddle with his people! Don\u2019t let his size fool you, he is a total lap-dog. He would prefer a home where he gets to spend most of his time with his people; Teddy tends to get anxious when he is alone too long. This goof-ball should be the only animal in the home but would do well with older, dog-savvy children.\n\nTeddy did test positive for heart worm and will be going through treatment. Best case scenario would be a foster to adopt home that is fairly close to Fryeburg. During treatment Teddy needs a quiet stress free environment which isn\u2019t always possible at the shelter!",

I am a big love bug, that loves to be dressed up and surrounded with fluffy blankets. I love cuddles, food, and to play! I'm definitely a lap dog even though I'm told I'm a bit too big. I want to be young forever, but the techs are teaching me manners, like the word \"No.\" And because I still need more training I need the perfect home with parents that will commit to my training. Won't you let me be your new best friend?",

He quickly adapted to the other household dog that is much older and is a bit possessive of his toys. Gizmo was submissive in dog language and they worked it out with no issues. He is willingly crated at night and after breakfast he likes to run and jump for joy around the yard, or play in the house with toys. Thenits nap time. He is completely housebroken, but not yet trained in basic commands. Gizmo is a healthy sweet bundle of love and will be the perfect gadget in his forever home!",

Since coming into foster care he has blossomed and is becoming less shy. He is working on potty training and learning boundaries. He loves to go for walks and will be a great hiking boy.

She also loves being near her canine buds and playing silly games even more than Emily does. Monse is a little more assertive than Emily. Monse also loves to go for car rides and anywhere her people go. She and Emily both like being out in the yard in a sunny spot and soaking in their surroundings. But their favorite place will be in your lap. This pair will give you so much love. They have not been with children but as gentle and friendly as they are, I am thinking that they will be ok with children who will know how to be gentle with them. Monse is looking for that special home along with her sister Emily.A safely fenced yard is a must.",

            "description": "Jack is a very handsome Australian cattle dog/ Border collie mix around a year old. He is a very active boy so will need a fenced yard or acreage/farm type home where he can run and get exercise. Jack is good with other dogs but wants to play with them a lot so another dog that is too old or too small to tell him enough will not be a good fit. Dogs with his energy level he loves. Our foster home is working with him on some manners because like most herding breeds he likes to use his mouth to tell you hello and play. No one trained him when he was younger so an active home that will put time in him will be best. Jack is a love bug and will cuddle and give you lots of love. His coat is so soft he is a joy to snuggle with. He has been around kids and does good but when he gets running around and excited he will probably knock over small children. He is learning commands fast in his foster home. Jack would make a good sports dog he is smart and learns quickly.\nTo help pay for vet bills and care (transportation, food, toys, etc..) a $250 donation is requested at the time of adoption. All of our adoptions are contingent upon an approved application, home visit, reference check, obedience training agreement, and signing of adoption contract. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped before adoption. Our dogs are companion animals that live indoors as part of your family. Please do not apply if your plan is to have them as outside dogs, garage dogs, porch dogs or outside kennel dogs. We do not ship dogs.\nAll of our dogs are in private foster homes. We are not a shelter with hours. A visit can be arranaged after an adoption questionnaire has been filled out and sent in. Please try email first. We are all volunteers that work so we can not easily take or make phone calls. 2/1/21 8:03 PM",

They contacted the person they rehomed Queso to, but they never called us or came for him. The previous owner said they had also gotten Queso from someone else and that he had been rehomed a few times. The owner registered on the chip advised he had to rehome Queso because he did not have enough time to spend with him or enough space for Queso to get proper exercise, and Queso tended to chew things/get destructive when left alone for long periods of time. Queso\u2019s previous owner said that he does listen well and that he knows basic commands such as \u201csit\u201d & \u201cstay\u201d. Queso loves water and playing fetch. He also loves to snuggle. Queso\u2019s owner also said that he is housetrained.\n\nQueso has proven to be a very playful boy, and he is always happy to meet other dogs here at the shelter. When meeting new dogs, Queso approached them with his tail wagging and exchanged sniffs and immediately wanted to play. Queso is high energy and his playful approach may be a bit much for more timid dogs, but he was happy to play with anyone who was willing.\n\nWhen walking through our cat room, a cat in a kennel growled at Queso, and Queso barked at it. He stared at the cat for a few more moments and then continued sniffing around the room.\n",

Blueberry needs a calm home with someone who has patience to get to know her and let her get to know you. Her anxiety seems to be escalated at the shelter, so she really needs a home where she will have more calmness and gain more confidence. Blueberry is a slender girl, who walks well on a leash once the excitement subsided. She likes toys and enjoys attention. She would probably do best as an only dog or with an older, calm, friendly dog.\n\n\n\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please fill out an on-line application at ochumane.org.  Due to COVID-19 we will only be contacting people with an approved application for followup information and to schedule a meet and greet by telephone.   We will not be at PetSmart Avon on Saturdays until further notice.  Thanks so much for your interest.  \n",

            "description": "Sista is a Boxer/American Bulldog mix around 4 years old and about 70 pounds. \nSista was found dumped along with her brother Bubba at 6 months old at someone\u2019s home. Although a kind samaritan began looking for rescue, years passed and nothing came of it. This left Sista and Bubba to stay outdoors at their home on tethers, then in kennels. \nSista is a sweet girl, that loves human touch and loves to cuddle. Sista came to us unsocialized with other dogs, but she\u2019s starting to become very responsive to the slow introductions with other dogs. \nSista is high heartworm positive and undergoing treatment which is covered by the rescue. Sista deserves a home like any dog does.\nBe her light!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

He was only in his last home for a few months before he became too much to handle. He is high energy, high drive, playful, curious, smart, mouthy, affectionate,  and has a tendency to push limits as he is used to getting away with everything. He will need an experienced home that can handle an outlet for both his energy and brain. He did live with a child in his last home  . He will not be placed with cats. His owner reported he can be dominant and territorial around new dogs at the dog park, but tends to warm up. He  has never lived with other dogs and can come off as aggressive initially.  He has some negative behaviors due to being bored, such as counter surfing, and acting on his shoe fetish. He only knows one command- sit-and will do it only when it's convenient for him. In the right home with structure and time, he will shine as an excellent companion.   He will come fixed, chipped, vaccinated, and heartworm tested negative. \n\n***If you are serious about adopting, you must first complete and submit an application on our website. We will not do anything without a completed application.

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Red, a 14 month old, 45-pound, Australian Cattle Dog/Australian Shepherd mix young fellow.\n\nRed is looking for an experienced owner(s) with a lot of patience to give him room to grow and slowly learn to trust people. He is a high energy pup who loves to run and play - chasing a tossed ball or playing tug are favorites.\n\nHe really likes rope toys, nylabones, and heavy duty stuffed toys he can happily chew on. He loves to go for walks, is great on a leash, and enjoys car rides, too A fenced yard is a plus for him.\n\nA very smart boy, Red knows sit and stay, and is working on drop it, leave it, go to spot, and down. He is housebroken and uses his crate for sleeping at night and periods of time during the day.\n\nRed must have some trauma in his past because he is very head shy. He does not like to be pet on his head, and getting his collar on and off is a bit of a challenge. But he is working on it. He also reacts to people and dogs while on the leash, but once he has had a chance to appropriately sniff he does settle down.\n\nRed is not a match for first time dog owners. He also should go to a home with kids or cats - too much sudden movement. Another confident, well-socialized dog in his home could benefit Red.\n\nIf you are an experienced owner with lots of love and patience to give a dog like Red then you will be rewarded by watching him blossom, love, trust, and really enjoy life with you!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Red, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted.

If you have additional questions about this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or contact us through our website!\n\nBuster arrived to us on January 7th, 2021, found out and about by a citizen. Buster is a very big boy weighing a whopping 75 pounds! This big boy is around a year and a half years old with an estimated birthday of 06/07/2019. Buster is a bundle of fun wrapped up in a gorgeous package. His striking brown eyes and impressive physique turn heads where ever he goes. Then comes the huge, adorably goofy, tongue out grin, and you're hooked! Buster enjoys toys and plays with them the same way he takes treats...gently. At the top of Buster's favorite things list is soaking up all the love he can get. His reaction to other dogs has been mixed, and he's pretty sure cats are useless, so this hunk of love will likely thrive in a home as your only fur baby. Buster's enthusiasm is infectious, and the family lucky enough to call him their own will reap the rewards of a lifetime of smiles.   \n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400. The price includes: a Home Again Microchip, set of shots, de-worming, heartworm testing (if old enough), spay or neuter, and a 1 year rabies shot (if old enough). All dogs adopted must leave with a county license at an additional cost of $17, this fee is cash only. Adoption fees can be done using credit card or cash.  If you are interested in this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or fill out an online application at www.hsmcohio.org",

We think she\u2019s a Boston Terrier/Boxer mix. Piper is 3 years old and has the energy of a puppy! All she wants is attention, cuddles and kisses all day long. She is the sweetest girl! When she gets excited she starts dancing, we call her \u201chappy feet\u201d! She gets very happy when its time to go outside, on a walk or for a drive in the car. She would do great in a home with another playful dog to keep her busy during the day. Also, a human that is home more often then not. She is almost 100% potty trained and sleeps in her crate at night. However, she does not like to be crated during the day as she gets a little but anxious in there. If you are interested in meeting Piper, please fill out an application!\n\nwww.mobilemuttsrescue.org\n\nPiper NEEDS a home with a fenced yard! Having another dog is a huge plus or kids that will love her! She requires a lot of love and attention. She is a great girl.",

We\u2019re technically not even supposed to have her at the property. With it being a rental my husband doesn\u2019t want to put in \u201creal\u201d fencing and she gets out of everything we\u2019ve tried. She\u2019s a sweet girl but is quite the good guard dog and thinks both our house and our next door neighbor\u2019s (who is a good friend) are her domain. My neighbor thinks she was about to bite her yard guy today. Hard to say if that\u2019s true but it really scared her and my hubs is done.\n\nShe is mostly lab with some Dalmatian and maybe something else mixed in. She\u2019s 5 1/2 years old and fixed, around 40-50lbs. Very good with kids. A bit excited sometimes but never rough. She\u2019s been around (her son) since he was born. She stayed next door with my neighbor\u2019s dogs for several months. But then the three big dogs (including mine) ganged up on the little dog so that was very bad. Not sure if it was a pack mentality thing or if the little dog just pushed her buttons. We also had chickens and she chased them some but never ate any. She is really sweet and gentle but maybe needs more room to roam? If you know of anyone who lives a bit more out in the country or at least has a fenced yard and would love an amazing dog.\u201d",

He knows a few basic commands and has been doing well with house training. Although he will need a home who will continue to work with him on both. He loves children too but has not been trained to not jump on people so we recommend he not go to a household with very small children. Prince is current on his vaccinations and is now eagerly searching for a loving family to call his own.

They lived on their own outside the previous owner's home before someone realized they needed help.\n\nWe would love them to be adopted together as they do love and depend on each other. They are lovely little girls who are easy-going and calm in the home.\n\nKiki is a love bug and likes to sit on your lap. Every once in a while she will feel a bout of playfulness and pull out a toy. She has a mild heart murmur that has been checked out by a cardiologist and it does not require medical treatment at this time.\n\nViolet is a sweetheart who loves her people. She is gentle and kind.\n\nBoth girls need to be reminded to go potty outside.\n\nWe would love to see this pair live our their golden years being loved and well cared for.\n\nThey are updated on all shots and are chipped. Their combined adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

            "description": "Mya is a candidate for our Foster To Adopt Program! She is currently undergoing heartworm treatment which will need to continue at Companions Animal Hospital in St. Cloud, MN.\n\nMya is lovable, loyal and well-mannered but trauma from her past made her intimidated by confident dogs. We placed Mya in a 2-week board & train program with K9 Off-Leash Training to help her gain confidence and learn basic manners. She has greatly improved and we are so excited for what the future holds for Mya! Adopters will receive a free training session with K9 Off-Leash Training to ensure Mya continues to keep up the great work!\n\nMya is a very sweet girl that absolutely loves people. She's extremely loyal to her family. She has stolen the hearts of many who have met her.\n\nMya is an active girl and will need a family that will bring her for daily walks or runs. She would also benefit from enrichment toys such as Kong balls or puzzle feeders.\n\nAge: 7 y/o\n\nBreed: Pitty Mix\n\nWeight: 40 lbs\n\nKid-friendly: Yes!\n\nDogs: Yes! She has lived with other dogs and has done well but there has been incidents when a toy is involved. We suggest the dogs we separated during playtime and mealtime. Also, no free-standing toys or bones in the house.\n\nCats: Unknown but she was able to meet the office cats through their condo and had zero reaction. She was interested in the new friend but not overly interested where we were concerned. We do not recommend dogs be left alone with cats.\n\nCrate trained: Yes! We recommend she eat and enjoy any toys or bones in her crate.\n\nPotty trained: Yes!\n\nLikes: Her people, relaxing, playing with other dogs and lots of love!\n\nHealth concerns: Heartworm Positive but currently undergoing treatment.\n\nBehaviors: She struggles with resource guarding.\n\nAdoption fee: $275\n\nIf you are interested in fostering, you must fill out a Foster Application here: http://www.greyfacerescue.org/foster\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.",

Over a year ago we came to know of Mitzi Ann and her plight which included being handed off to some different owners and her owner trying to turn her in to a shelter Because they were moving to a place with no fenced yard. The shelter was full and couldn't accept her but just weeks later she was found running loose and in danger Of being hit by a car. She was thin and really not in good shape at all. The shelter picked her up and Critter Cavalry Rescue took her in to help get her healthy and to Get her a wonderful new home. We finally found the best \"only dog\" home for her and we were ecstatic at the love and care she was going to receive. Now ..COVID Has hit and this beautiful soul is losing her home because he dad has lost his job and cannot find work and will be returning to his native Jamaica in February. Mitzi Ann Has blossomed into a stunning girl that plays ball every morning with her dad and stays so close to him as his companion in life. . She is about 85 pound now and her shiny coat and clear eyes just tells us that she has been well loved and cared for. She is thriving just as we prayed she would. she is housebroken, good on a leash and a perfect companion. She would prefer to be the only dog but has accepted a pair of puppies that recently joined the household and they too will be needing new homes. The adoptive couple are in tears to lose their dogs. Please give this 9 year old girl a chance to live out another 5+ wonderful years with you. She is a treasure. If you interested please email us ASAP. ccrtennessee@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED.

He just couldn\u2019t care for me and I was in need of some medical attention.  The deputies took me to the vet where I had emergency surgery for infection. I am still in the recovery process, but I feel sooooo much better!  While I have been here the shelter took care of my vaccinations, they tested me for heartworms and I was negative, they gave me a microchip, and they had me spayed.  No more babies for me!!  The volunteers say that I am a sweet, shy girl that just wants love.  Is that the kind of dog you are hoping to find as a companion? Well my name is Snowflake and I am waiting for you!  FYI\u2026the volunteers say that I take care of my \u201cbusiness\u201d as soon as I walk outside! Good to know, right?",

Upon arrival at Cedar Bend, we discovered that Lou has no teeth and very tender gums. She eats wet food and still enjoys playing with softer chew toys!\n\nAGE: Approximately 6 years.\n\nTRICKS & COMMANDS: Sit\n\nABOUT LOU: Lou is a super calm and sweet lady who loves people! She walks like a proper little lady on a leash (you'll adore her prance!) and loves being close to her handler.\n\nShe loves chasing a tennis ball around outside, and she will sit pretty for any treats you'll give her. Lou loves to show you how fast she can wag her tail when she gets excited!\n\nWhile Lou needs to be the only pet in the home, she's sure to give you all the love you could ever need from your new furry best friend.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

Whiskey came in neutered so all he will need is a rabies vaccination. Whiskey is great in his kennel, he knows how to sit and he is high energy. This goofy boy will chase his own tail. He does have a bad habit of jumping on you but it's just he get so excited for attention. He walks good on a leash. He will need work on his manners but he loves treats so that will help. His adoption fee $23.  \n\nApproved adoption applications will be contacted for an appointment.\n\nIf you are interested in putting in an application on this animal, please copy and paste the link below to fill out our application for adoption. https://siloamsprings.seamlessdocs.com/f/JRJtFk\n\nWe have a wonderful foster program available (if you live inside city limits) to see if the animal compliments or complicates your life. This is an excellent way to see how the pet would get along with family members and other pets! The paperwork takes just a few minutes and you can walk out the door worry free with a fuzzy friend. Call today to inquire more about how you can take this pet home! If you are adopting this cutie, contact the shelter for adoption fees. The Shelter hours are Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri, 11-5 and Saturday 10-3 closed on Sun and Wed. Our number is 479-524-6535. All animals will be spayed/neuter before going to their new home\nCharacteristics",

PLEASE USE THE PROVIDED CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS ANIMAL AND HOW TO ADOPT THEM.\n\nSadie (also response well to Tater) is a 4 year old mutt mix looking for her forever home. She's a very active girl who cares deeply about her fitness and likes to stay consistent in her workout routine. Sadie has had a chaotic first four years of her life and now finds extreme comfort in structure and routines.  Especially if those routines include a mid-day cuddle session and reading a nice book before you tuck her into bed. \n\nSadie is dog selective and would like to be in a home by herself with humans who will take the time introducing her to other dogs and be able to read the signs when she is just not that into it. Once she makes a friend though, they'll be besties for life. As you can see in her pictures she has a great pack of dog friends she loves to play with! Her foster has dedicated lots of time to her introductions to these dogs so that they can all be best friends! \n\nSadie is house trained, crate trained, leash trained, and comes when called. She's just looking for a best friend to workout with and spend A LOT of her free time cuddling with. \n\nPlease get in touch with her foster Darby by email darby.knoll44@gmail.com to learn more about Sadie and the possibility of meeting her!",

Once I get to know you and trust you, I will be a very loving and loyal companion!  I arrived at the MCSPCA on 1/15/21.

If anyone so much as looked at me or walked in my direction, I ran straight to the back of my crate and hid.\n\nAfter a few days of quiet time in my own space, I have really opened up to my foster mom. She was patient enough to let me approach her on my own terms, so I'll need to find a forever family that understands and does the same. I promise your patience will pay off and I will be hopping on your lap and making myself comfortable in no time!\n\nBecause I am easily frightened, I'd like to go to a quieter home with no young children--they're a bit too unpredictable for me. I'm also a bit jumpy and mouthy when I get excited. My foster family has been correcting my behavior, and says I'm making lots of progress already!\n\nThere are two big dogs and one cat in my foster home, and while I wouldn't mind a buddy to play with, I'd prefer a buddy of the canine variety. I don't think I've had much exposure to cats before, so I will chase and bark at them. I'm also perfectly happy as an only dog, although having another dog around might help me build my confidence.\n\nI am very treat-motivated, so I can certainly be bribed to become your new best friend. I also love to chew on bones and chew toys. I sleep in my crate in my own room at night but you'll have to bribe me with treats to get me in the crate. Can you blame me? Once I trust you, I just want to be with you all the time! I only sleep in my crate because my current foster brother gets snappy when he's sleepy. Otherwise, I'd be trusted with free roam of the house (so long as I get enough potty breaks). I'm working really hard on potty training and think I'd continue to benefit from a regular routine/schedule.\n\nIf you think we might be a good fit, please fill out an adoption application--I'd love to tell you more about myself and get to know you, too!\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs). Ruff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.

Once seperated from each other though they have became great dogs. Gordo has not been in a foster home yet but currently shares a kennel at our facility with 2 other dogs and does great. he's been very sweet with us and has tons of energy. Delillah and Bam Bam are in a foster home so have worked on potty training and crate training and are doing great. These dogs cannot be adopted together as they do much better seperated, as they tend to feed off of each other.\n\n**NO SMALL CHILDREN\n\n***MUST HAVE BREED EXPERIENCE\n\n**NO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\n\n****PLEASE DO NOT CALL TO CHECK STATUS OF A DOG...PHONE CALLS ARE FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY. EMAIL US WITH ANY QUESTIONS ON ADOPTION AS WE DO NOT GET BACK TO PHONE CALLS ABOUT ADOPTION.\n\nShots up to date (DHPP), wormed, micro chipped, altered (spayed/neutered). We also now give one free vet visit with our local vet within first 3 days of adoption!!\n\nAdoption cost for this dog is $250\n\nWe are a rescue, and although we have a facility in Modesto most of our dogs/pups are currently being fostered in or around our area. So please be willing to make the trip to see them if you are from out of the area. Our adoption process REQUIRES that an application must first be submitted and approved prior to meeting any of our pets. Just note that we may get several responses on one pet at a time so just because you have an approved application does not mean said pet is on hold for you. One must FIRST confirm an appointment to meet the pet after an approved application has been sent. To inquire about this specific pet, please write to info@pupznpalz.org for an application. Please remember to put the pets name in the subject line when emailing, and on the top on the application. It helps us to help you that must faster. We are a group of volunteers, and ask that you please bare with us. We will get to each person just as quickly as we can. If you do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please send another request as we have been having problems with e-mail.\n\nemail: info@pupznpalz.org and ask for an application for which dog you are interested in\n\nphone: 209-480-8662 (9-6 pm only please, cell phone, emergencies only please...do not call to ask status of dog, email please)\n\n**ADOPTION EVENTS: typically every Sat at Modesto Petco 2021 Evergreen Ave from 12-3\n\n**OUR FACILITY: Located at 1430 Carpenter Lane Suite B (by appointment only as we do not have set hours)",

Once I warm up to you, I am all of the best qualities of friendship wrapped up in one fuzzy package. I'm looking for a forever home full of love and patience; if you think we sound like a good match, please come visit me at Helping Hands Humane Society today!\n\nFrom: Owner Surrender\nWeight: 98 lbs - I am a very strong girl and tend to pull on the leash when I'm excited. \nExercise: Moderate to High Energy\nLarge/Small dogs: My previous owner said I did well with dogs. It is always a good idea to bring in your dog to meet with me here to make sure we will get along. \nChildren: Please bring the whole family in to visit. \nCats/other small animals: My previous owner said I did okay with cats in the home. You can always ask an adoption counselor to do a cat test with me. \n\n*HHHS Behavior Team will consult with you about my anxiety.*\n Primary Color: Tan Weight: 98lbs Age: 5yrs 2mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "Meet Willy Dilly, he is as silly as his name sounds. He is a beautiful brindle Pit Bull Mix who loves everyone. Willy is very social with men, women, and dog savvy children that can let Willy warm up to them at his pace. Willy LOVES dogs of all sizes, but not all dogs love him back. He can be very overbearing with dogs when he plays as he likes to run and tackle and them to the ground and then run off. He loves to play with toys, the bigger and squeakier the better for him. Willy is still not 100% housebroken but gets better every day with consistent bathroom breaks. Willy must have another dog in the home that he meets prior to adoption because he is very fearful and skittish when by himself. Willy also must go to a home with a securely fenced in backyard, so no apartment or condos. Willy Dilly truly is a great dog who is sure to make a great addition to any family! He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, vet checked and microchipped. His adoption fee of $160 includes a free vet visit.\n\n**Visit our website or facebook page for special events schedules!***\n\nWebsite:\nwww.azsmalldog.org /\n\nFacebook:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/arizonasmalldogrescue/",

            "description": "Astrid is a petite husky mix who is approximately 7 years young. She was found as a stray, so her previous life is a complete mystery. She currently weighs about 40 lbs and may gain a little more weight but should stay well under 50 lbs. She was found with a skin condition that may have led to some fur loss - it is possible that she may become a little more fluffy as she continues to eat enough good quality food.\n\nAstrid loves being part of a family. She loves her foster family's boys, especially the 8 year old boy, and happily walks with him on a leash and will even trot beside him in a pseudo jog if encouraged. When allowed, she happily sleeps on the couch next to her human - any human will do - she shows love to everyone she meets!\n\nAstrid has happy feet. She uses her front paws to express a variety of emotions - if she's happy to see you, impatience with the speed at which you are feeding her, and several other, as yet, undeciphered dances. They are one of the most unique things about her character!\n\nThe most unique thing about her appearance is her bi-colored eyes. Many dogs have two colors, but Astrid's darker eye is a beautiful shade of amber that is very unusual in a dog.\n\nAll that perfection does have a few points that need to be taken note of. Astrid needs to be the only dog in her household. She's a resource hog and can't be trusted to share space around other dogs for eating, watching humans eat, playing with toys (even though she doesn't really play with toys), or even sharing the same doorway out to the deck. She does ok in an outdoor setting with other dogs, and the shelter reported that she \"got along with everything\", but in the household setting, that has not proven to be the case. She does not have this resource guarding issue with humans - it is possible to pet her while she is eating, and you can certainly walk out the door when she is on the other side of it. She also needs work on her housetraining. While she came into her foster home obviously familiar with being in a home, her skills need to be adjusted.\n\nAstrid sleeps quietly in a crate all night and enjoys spending time outside during the day. She is not a barker or a digger and seems to enjoy watching the neighborhood activity. She is not overactive - her morning walk seems to satisfy her daily exercise needs.\n\nAstrid is a wonderful dog and would do well in either a family or without children. She's confident, doesn't mind the vacuum cleaner, and doesn't bark in her kennel. In return for your patience with her few issues, she will give you love, loyalty, and laughterAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip and rabies and other core vaccinations.",

I'll take the compliment, thank you!\n\nI am a sweet and friendly girl who has so much love to give! I absolutely adore my humans and enjoy snuggling with them. Spending a nice evening snuggled up to my favorite person sounds just about perfect to me! Speaking of my people, my foster family includes a couple small humans and I think they are pretty great. I can get a bit bouncy so I would need to be shown how to be calm when around tiny humans if my new home had them. I mean them no harm I just get happy to see them! Though I tend to be more on the easy going and calm side I do have a silly side that I let out every now and then. I enjoy playing with my canine foster siblings and my toys. We have quite a bit of fun together. \n\nGreat news! My foster family says that I am a very good girl and know to do my business outside. When going for a walk I am well behaved and don't usually pull. I will even potty on leash too. My foster family has been working with me and teaching me all the things. I know sit, down and come so far. I would be happy to learn anything you might want to teach me as long as it comes with yummy treats! While my foster family is away I spend time in my crate. Though I would rather be wherever they are I don't mind waiting patiently for them to come back. \n\nIf you are looking for a happy, sweet, cuddly, playful girl then you found me! I can't wait to meet you soon! \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

They will be going to their forever homes soon, but I am still looking for mine.  I have to spayed before going to my new home, but that should be pretty soon, hopefully within the next couple weeks!  I take a few minutes to warm up to new people, but once I do, I am a very sweet and friendly girl.  I love getting outside to explore and go for walks, and I walk very nicely on a leash.  I would love a big, fenced yard so I can run around and play outside!  I get along great with other dogs, so if you have a friend at home for me to play with, we would have so much fun!  I came to the MCSPCA on 11/20/20.  Want to stop by the shelter and go for a walk with me?",

            "description": "Meet our sweet girl Princess! She is a 2 year old Pit mix that came to us from a partner shelter in Georgia in November 2020. Princess can be very shy at first, but once she warms up to you, she'll be your loyal companion. She walks pretty well on a leash but can be easily startled by loud noises or fast cars going by. She is very very treat motivated and just wants belly rubs all the time! After some playtime, she would love a cozy dog bed to curl up on or a big couch for snuggles. She is very loyal and loving, making her the perfect companion! Since Princess can be easily overwhelmed with new situations and tends to be very attached to \"her person\", she would prefer to be in a home with very little foot traffic and also a home with a single owner. Princess is also dog friendly, and we believe that her confidence would come out more if she were to live with another dog. She can be a bit too much energy for some dogs, so she would need to meet another dog prior to adoption. If you are looking for a big lovebug, and someone to just absolutely spoil with attention, then Princess is your girl! \n\nIf you think that Princess could be a good fit for you, please submit an online application. A generous donor has sponsored Princess's adoption fee! That means she will go home for $0 with an approved adoption.",

Mystic loves all people and older kids, and gets along with other dogs with proper introductions. We are unsure about cats, but he is a pretty chill dog. Mystic loves to cuddle, he knows his basic commands and is fully house trained. He loves walks, but tugs a bit on a leash - a harness helps with that a lot. He is the sweetest boy! Mystic would benefit from an active family and a 6ft fence, he\u2019s a typical husky escape artist.  His adoption fee is $250. he\u2019s located in St. Louis, Mo. \n\nTo find out more please fill out an application at www.wonderweimsrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/.

            "description": "Look at this gorgeous girl! Say hello to Kiera! <3\n\n\"I think Kiera was an outside dog. She's shy when she meets people. She's sweet but doesn't want to be touched. We are working on trust, so she will enjoy petting and back rubs. Kiera hasn't had any accidents in the house. She sleeps a lot. Acts like she hasn't been inside a house very often so is timid about exploring it inside. It's been rewarding watching her heal. She's gaining weight. Her skin is healing and her hair is growing back.\nKiera was more active when Burl Ives was here. She tried engaging him in play, bouncing and zooming around him. That was a joy to watch.\"\n\nKiera is a gorgeous girl who hasn't had the best life. She was rescued by OAA after it was reported that some dogs were living alone on a property. Their owner had fallen ill and was in the hospital and there was no one else around to care for them. When they reached out to us about intaking this girl, we knew she would soon be part of our fluffy butt family! \n\nKiera is a 10 year old female Great Pyrenees/Golden Retriever mix. She currently weighs about 64lbs, but is still on the thin side. She came to us with a lot of hair loss, but thanks to loving care of her foster it has been coming back in nicely. Kiera is happy when meeting new people, but also a bit shy. She wants to be social, but at the same time can be reserved. Kiera has not been to any public outings, but given her age and personality she is probably more of a homebody. Her personality is calm and laid back. Kiera has excellent house manners, and can be given free roam of the house. Kiera has not shown to be a big chewer in her foster home. She hasn't been super vocal, but she does bark if there is reason too. \n\nKiera is uninterested in playing fetch. We are unsure if she is a water dog or not. Kiera does sometimes play with toys. She seems to be slowly figuring out what they are. Kiera has not shown to have any food aggression or resource guarding in her foster home. Kiera doesn't seem to be a big hugger and doesn't jump on people. Kiera walks okay on a leash, but could use some more working with. Kiera does currently get car sick. We are unsure how Kiera would do in an apartment setting. When no one is home or at night, she stays in the sunroom and does great! Kiera is potty trained, but is NOT kennel trained. \n\nKiera is your typical senior. She is calmer, she is low maintenance and a total sweetheart once she settles in. She has started prancing around like a puppy at times, and it is the cutest thing ever! If you are interested in this beauty, here are some things to note\n\n-Kiera is shy around other dogs. She mostly keeps to herself. However, she is in love with the foster puppies her foster currently has. She is even playful with them at times. \n\n-Kiera is good with cats.\n\n-Kiera has not been around any kids. Given her age, they should be older. She probably can't handle the energy of a toddler, but would probably love the attention from an older kiddo. \n\n-Kiera is being fostered in Sand Springs, OK. We do ask her adoptive family be able to pick her up in person, even if they are out of state. \n\nKiera isn't really looking for much in her new home. She is looking for a calmer home environment. One that has lots of love to give, but also knows she is an older gal and sometimes likes her peace. If you want to spoil this girl through her golden years, then please apply to adopt her at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHer adoption fee is $150. That will include her DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella. She will also have bloodwork done and be spayed. She will be heart-worm and ehrlicia negative, and be current on her preventatives. She will also be micro-chipped.",

Look no further than this dog, variously referred to here at the shelter as \"Shadow\" or \"that sweet old man.\" Shadow is a calm terrier who can be shy at first but will quickly nuzzle up to you with his salt-and-pepper muzzle once you show him some kindness and maybe a few treats. He is well-behaved, gentle, and enjoys going on long leisurely walks with his favorite people. Shadow would likely do well with other dogs that go about his own speed but is wary of cats and may do best with only dog-savvy feline friends.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT** This dog is currently being cared for in a foster home. To apply to adopt this animal, please fill out the application found in the link below and send it to adoptionreview@gmail.com\n\nhttps://bit.ly/36D4hBD",

Please complete our information sheet for adoption (https://pflugervillepetsalive.org/ppaforms/PPADogAdoptionInformationSheet.pdf) and return it to us, the adoption team adopt@pflugervillepetsalive.org. Because there may be other interested adopters, it is in your best interest to submit your information sheet and schedule a meet and greet as soon as possible.\n\nPUPPIES AND OTHER HIGHLY-ADOPTABLE DOGS DISCLAIMER:\nPuppies and other highly-adoptable dogs (small dogs or desirable-breed dogs) at PPA! are very high in demand and usually have several interested adopters. Inquiring about a dog, meeting a dog, and even applying for a dog does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt the dog. \n\nOnly one household will be able to adopt each dog, which means all other interested households will inevitably and unfortunately be disappointed. Please consider this in your search and set your expectations accordingly. Please also consider that adult dogs do not typically have competing adopters, and they need forever homes, too! \n\nPPA! does not allow the adoption of dogs who are related (e.g., littermates or mom and pup) to the same household for behavioral reasons.",

            "description": "Meet Frank! He is a 2-year-old lemon hound who weighs about 40 pounds. He came to us as a stray and is now looking for his forever home!\n\nFrank is a friendly guy who loves living life to the fullest! He needs some practice on a leash and is hard at work being potty- and crate-trained at his new foster home. Frank is a great co-pilot in the car. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Frank, please fill out an application at www.henricohumane.org/adopt-a-dog\n\nOur adoption events are back on! They are held every Saturday, excluding major holidays, at the Petco next to Trader Joe's in Short Pump from 11:00 to 2:00 (11331 West Broad Street, Glen Allen, VA). Petco's COVID-19 safety standards apply and we ask that all patrons wear a face covering while in the store and keep a 6-foot distance from the other shoppers while you meet our awesome dogs!\n\n* Please note that not all dogs attend our adoption events. Please email dogs@henricohumane.org to find out if Frank will be coming.",

As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt dogs to homes with young children. Homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

She has a corgi build and specializes in snuggling on the couch. \n\nThis darling 3 year old also enjoys playing ball, playing with her foster siblings and showing off her tricks. Sammy has been working hard with The Pet Connection to learn to trust people again and slow introductions are important. Don't worry though, once she gets to know you she will be your new furry sidekick. \n\nSammy is house broken and does wonderfully in the kennel if needed. She thinks cats are interesting and believes they should also play chase. She loves dogs of all sizes and has exceptional manners when playing. Sammy would do best in a household with adults only or youth over 16. She is the best girl and her foster Mom tells her she is ABSOLUTELY worth the work to earn her love forever.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Sammy, just fill out an application at www.pawsitivetailskc.org and her foster will set that up! Sammy's adoption fee is $150 and she's up to date on vaccines, dewormed, current on flea and heartworm prevention, heartworm negative, spayed and microchipped.",

            "description": "From P-nut's Foster Mom: A sweet, older dog who is looking for a human that he can trust. P-nut is very attached to other dogs, no matter what size. He loves to cuddle up next to them and sleep. It took him almost 4 weeks to allow me to pet him. He is very shy and is afraid of any loud noises or sudden movements. He has gained a great amount of confidence since being with me, but will still need a patient and loving owner who will be willing to work with him in order to gain his trust.P-nut is pee pad trained. He is not leash trained and has no idea what to do when on the other end. Therefore I've kept him mostly indoors. He does enjoy going outside on a screened in deck, but only if he is with another dog. Otherwise he will bark until he is let in. P-nut hates being in a crate, but there is no reason to crate him, as he is non-destructive. He had extensive dental work done on Jan 14 and I believe this has contributed to his well being and improved mood. He has a wonderful appetite and is not fussy. P-nut loves car rides and will usually sit quietly in the back seat. He is not a `yapper` but will alert bark if something is going on in the yard. He is also quite an architect when it comes to constructing his own place to sleep. He will whirl and twirl, trying to get the covers just right, until he finally settles down to nap. This is a sweet little dog who has come a long way while he has been in my home. He is stil very shy, but gets braver and more confident each day. If you are patient and willing to work with him, I believe that he will soon forget the bad memories of his earlier life and will love and reward you for years to come.Thank you for considering a shelter dog!The Haywood County Animal Services Adoption Center is located at 453 Jones Cove Road, Clyde, NC 28721.

But now he\u2019s doing the best he can to settle down and find a relaxing home all his own. In fact, he spent some time in a foster home with an accomplished pianist and discovered that the one thing he loves more than friendly people are friendly people who play and listen to music!\n\nThis perfectly-sized boy with his copper-colored coat and origami ears is a real lovebug and likely to be the hit of your social media feed (if you\u2019re one of those people who can\u2019t help posting adorable photos of your adopted dog all day long.) Pedro is the ultimate couch cuddler and also enjoys sniffing his heart out in the yard or on short, brisk walks. \n\nSimilar to a young gentleman who spent his 20s wandering freely through the deserts of the southwest or mountains of Appalachia fine-tuning his survival skills, Pedro is slowly but surely adjusting to life in a home and all the new things that come with it. He\u2019s working on his manners,  learning to be patient, and loves keeping busy with fun food toys, puzzles and games. \n\nLike a lot of us these days, he can get anxious in certain situations and would really thrive in a loving, mellow home where he can move at his own pace and enjoy life\u2019s simple pleasures. With the right home and circumstances, Pedro might fit in nicely with another canine companion. But he\u2019d be even more thrilled to be your one and only. Cats and little people aren\u2019t likely to be ideal roommates for this once-nomadic boy. But he\u2019s hoping you won\u2019t hold that against him. \n\nIf you\u2019re ready to share your world with a soulful pup looking for love, Pedro is your man. His adoption fee is WAIVED due to a generous donor.\n\nTo apply, please fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/xNDgaNpskHm11qoKA",

            "description": "Sandy is a super soft, kind gal who looking for her forever human. She loves getting pets and attention and will adoringly look into your eyes as you do so. She seems indifferent to having a dog companion and is the typical Velcro dog, waiting at each door or gate in my home until I return, even if I leave her foster-sibling with her, she's not interested in playing with him. She may be 7, but this gal is young at heart (and body) and has really enjoyed camping and hiking with me on the weekends- sticking her head out the 4Runner window and sleeping all night in the back with me. She's lived most her life outside so is learning the rules on house-training but doing exceptionally well! She will need more training on where to potty, but does best if left in smaller sections of the house. She sleeps all night in the kennel without an accident or peep. She will need some basic \"house-rules\" training and responds really well to verbal commands and redirection. She's not too big on toys and is really unsure what this game of fetch is, but will happily come to her name, sit, or lay down and is very food motivated. She hasn't chewed a single thing in the home, doesn't appear startled by loud noises, and loves being blow-dried. She walks on a leash really well, but pulls when she wants to sniff something so will need some continued training. She enjoys a comfy seat on the couch and will be your shadow as you walk room to room. She will make a wonderful companion to a person who is ready to open their home to a dog with endless love. I have not had her around kids or cats, she seems afraid of hyper dogs or dogs who want to be in her face immediately, and prefers a gentle introduction.",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Ollie is a 5 month old mastiff mix who will join us from the Kitsap Humane Society. He will be a large dog, currently weighing 45ish pounds, will most likely be in the 90lb range when full grown. While at the shelter he has been stressed by the environment, so he will need a solid decompression time. We will post more info as we get to know him. Due to his breed we will be looking for homes with fenced yards and prefer a canine companion to help show him the world is a wonderful place.\n\nFoster Update:\nOllie is the sweetest puppy in the whole world. He would be super happy being your cuddle buddy and loves to lay on my feet while I'm working. He loves to play, but is an incredibly laid back puppy. He seems to be more of a couch potato than an athlete, but loves to chase my resident dog around, go on walks, and play with stuffies. He adores other dogs and is really good at learning their boundaries and taking cues.\nHe can be shy in new situations and meeting new people but it doesn't take long for him to get past that and give you love. He does really well in his crate. There is a little whining at first, but he settles down after a few minutes and sleeps through the night. He's picked up that if he needs to use the restroom he just needs to go to the door.\nHe's very food focused and has picked up on \"sit\" and \"wait\" fairly quickly. He is great at sharing treats and toys with my resident dog. He's such a sweet pup with a loving heart, I know he's going to make someone ridiculously happy.\n\nAdoption Info:\nAdoption fee is $500 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online:\nwww.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

I'm a 2 year old pit bull mix. I have tail that never stops wagging because I'm one happy dog.\n\nI am crate trained and housebroken. I know basic commands such as sit and down. I've been practicing walking on a leash and I know with continued practice I'll be a champ.\n\nSome of my favorite things are playing with my foster dad and then snuggling up next to him when we're done. I just love my humans. Are you interested in making me part of your family? If so, apply for me today at buffalocares.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $275 + $50 Refundable Training Deposit RR048All dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered. If interested in learning more or adopting please fill out an application on our website at www.buffalocares.org.\n\nRegistration No.: RR048\n2/2/21 5:21 PM",

Salem came in as a chipped stray but was signed over by her owner the same day. Sigh. At least she didn\u2019t have to sit on a long chip hold. She was a bit nervous in kennel and hesitant about leashing. Once outside she was an easy walker and definitely owner searching. Her ankles look banged up and raw and she has a lump on her head that doesn\u2019t seem right (medical is going to check her out). She didn\u2019t seek out affection right away but did let us give her light pets towards the end of our time. She wasn\u2019t interested in treats or toys but did show her knowledge of commands by sitting when asked. Salem started to cry to leave when we were inside and would try to pull towards the exit. How heartbreaking for her to know her people won\u2019t be coming to take her home.\n\nSurrender notes: unable to care for, lived with kids 3-5 years, lived with dogs.",

While she is well-loved, Mia lives on a farm with cattle and spends the day barking at them which is scaring the cattle. Mia is not well-suited to farm life. \n\nMia's owner, Ashlee, shared that Mia is great with other dogs. She is also great with kids. She does very well with house-training and only has a few accidents in the house. \n\nAshlee thinks Mia will probably be medium sized when she is fully grown. She has her puppy shots but not yet her rabies shot. Contact Ashlee at 575-740-6177 to discuss Mia. \n\nMia is part of Sierra County Humane Society's program called Adopt-a-Pet Referral. There are no costs to the adopter when adopting Mia. Mia currently lives with Ashlee and she will choose Mia's adopter.",

This poor pup is sooo skinny. He needs about 20lbs added to his frame. I offered to donate 20lbs from my frame, but unfortunately that\u2019s not how this all works. Dudley was scared to come out of his cage, but eagerly took treats so eventually he learned if he followed the lady with the treats in her pocket he\u2019d get more. Dudley walked ok on leash outside, but he was a little nervous of his new surroundings and it was pretty icy. We went back inside where it was warm and Dudley could have all the treats he wanted. His eyes are irritated and his poor chin looks like it has a little rash. Dudley knows sit and chomps down treats like a champ, complete with mastiffy drool. He\u2019s a little cautious with petting right now but is comfortable enough with you to put his whole snout in your pocket for treats, so we\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019ll come around soon.",

            "description": "Blu is an all around happy boy that came to us when he was picked up harassing some neighborhood dogs.  At that time, he was unneutered and heartworm positive.  He has since been neutered and has made friends with some of our dogs in the shelter and is being treated for his heartworms.  If you have existing dogs, we would require a meet and greet with them to make sure they get along. He is a sweet boy that loves to play but also loves to relax.  Come meet Blu!!! Blu is believed to be about 16 months old and he keeps his kennel pretty clean so we think he should be pretty easy to housebreak.  \n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, at least one round of parvo distemper vaccine and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

A foster family was looking at all the dogs at ACCT and Rosie was a new arrival that day. We noticed she had very large swollen mammaries and a severe case of mastitis. Three of her mammary glands ruptured and became severely infected due to her previous owners never seeking out medical care for her. Rosie is an example of a dog that was used for breeding and when she was no longer useful throw out. We do not know if Rosie has been shown love or care but it is clear after full examination from our vets that she has suffered abuse. She had a bb gun bullet in her side when we took her in. With a full body x ray review, we found out that she had a healed rib and femur fractures. Looking at Rosie, it is CLEAR that humans have failed her! \n\nRosie is sweet and very tolerant with people she trusts. She is a true example of resilience and we can\u2019t wait to give her the life she has always truly deserved. \n\nRosie has been doing well around SUBMISSIVE MALE DOGS ONLY!! Rosie is potty trained and is crate trained although she would prefer to sleep in the bed or on your couch. Rosie can be scared meeting new people at first (mostly men) but warms up very quickly. Rosie has not been around children while in foster care so we are unsure of how she would be so a proper meet and greet would be required. Because of this we are recommending children 10 years of age or older for Rosie. Rosie will be spayed prior to adoption. She is already microchipped, up to date on all vaccines, heartworm negative, started on heartworm prevention and flea and tick prevention.",

This boy really likes attention too and he has no problem letting everyone know. Keagan can be whiny in his kennel when he sees people or other dogs going out, but who can blame him. He is ecstatic when he realizes it\u2019s his turn and allows quick leashing. Keagan walks nicely in the yard and was overall easy to handle. He demonstrated his knowledge of commands sitting when asked even on the freezing snow. He is under weight and food motivated. Keagan is gentle taking his treats and doesn't push for more even though his belly was empty. He allowed handling all over and didn't hesitate to invade our personal space when given the opportunity. Keagan came in neutered with a microchip, yet his family hasn't come for him. All we want for him is people that will love and care for him like he deserves, that includes regular meals and keeping safe in a warm home. It seems like stating the obvious but it was missing in his recent days.",

            "description": "On a bitter cold windy day, Lionel and Nicole were abandoned outside a local grocery story.  Their rescuer found them huddled together shivering inside a plastic crate with no door.  They were brought to our shelter and are now warm and safe.  Lionel and Nicole are small Rat Terrier/Chihuahua mixes estimated to be two years old.  They are cute as a button and weigh around ten pounds each.  Both pups have been fully vetted and are now healthy, happy, and ready to find a new home.  Lionel and Nicole are quite bonded and will need to be adopted together.  Both are very sweet and friendly and will make wonderful family pets.  Outgoing and playful, these two cuties love people of all sizes.  Lionel and Nicole keep each other well entertained but are open to making new canine friends.  They play very well with other small dogs and don\u2019t mind sharing their toys.  We have not had them around cats, but can test that for you.  We don\u2019t know if they are housetrained but they do prefer going on grass.  A fenced in yard will help with training and keep them safe when outside.  If you are looking for a new family pet, please consider adopting this pair.  Lionel and Nicole are proof that two is better than one.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

Their rescuer found them huddled together shivering inside a plastic crate with no door.  They were brought to our shelter and are now warm and safe.  Lionel and Nicole are small Rat Terrier/Chihuahua mixes estimated to be two years old.  They are cute as a button and weigh around ten pounds each.  Both pups have been fully vetted and are now healthy, happy, and ready to find a new home.  Lionel and Nicole are quite bonded and will need to be adopted together.  Both are very sweet and friendly and will make wonderful family pets.  Outgoing and playful, these two cuties love people of all sizes.  Lionel and Nicole keep each other well entertained but are open to making new canine friends.  They play very well with other small dogs and don\u2019t mind sharing their toys.  We have not had them around cats, but can test that for you.  We don\u2019t know if they are housetrained but they do prefer going on grass.  A fenced in yard will help with training and keep them safe when outside.  If you are looking for a new family pet, please consider adopting this pair.  Lionel and Nicole are proof that two is better than one.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

I\u2019ve been neutered, made up to date on all necessary vaccines, microchipped, and tested negative for heartworm. I weigh 64 lbs and have an adoption fee of $210. We are first come first serve, so if you\u2019re interested, you can visit me at CHS in the Sternburg Dog Run. We are open from 12 to 6 PM, Tuesdays through Saturdays, and process our last adoption at 5:30 PM. If you have any dogs currently, a meet and greet is required to make sure we get along. Please make sure they are up to date on their rabies and distemper vaccine as we require that proof before a meet and greet. See you soon!",

I can be cautious with men but not aggressively.  I love to play with my foster siblings but settle down quickly when it\u2019s time. \n\nI am house-broken and crate-trained. I was cat tested when I was at the shelter and wasn\u2019t interested in the cats. I was also bird tested with a parrot. He was kind of scary!  My foster mom thinks I\u2019m such a lovely girl and a delight.  I am looking forward to finding my perfect forever home to call my own someday soon. \n\nDuring her veterinary exam when she was first rescued, Ava was diagnosed with EPI, a disease that prevents the pancreas from properly absorbing food. She requires  Her condition is easily managed with an enzyme powder sprinkled on her food, so she can get the nutritional value she needs.  With the time, care, nutritious food and exercise that have been provided by her foster mom, Ava is thriving, has gained weight and confidence, and rediscovered her joy of living.\n\nAva has been spayed, is current on her vaccinations, has tested negative for heartworm and has been microchipped.\n\nWe are committed to doing our part to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Until life goes back to normal, we will not be doing adoption events at PetSmart. Instead, we will be doing individual meetings by appointment and practicing social distancing at each meeting.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our online adoption application at www.uaaf.org. For more information, or to schedule an appointment, call/text Kirsty at (435) 671-0985, or email kirsty.ju@gmail.com.\n",

            "description": "Sweet Lovable 9yo Female 14lbs $150 adoption feePepper is an owner surrender due to her owner passing away. The family member who had her for a while decided he wasnt able to keep her. He said that he had a problem with her pooping in the house. She has been good in foster with just a few accidents, but is highly supervised, crated when not attended , and praised for potting where appropriate. She came to us with horrible ear infections that had been left to get really bad. Both ear canals were so swollen shut the vet could not even get into them to do an exam. After a week on pred they had gone down and medication/ culture done. She is on a second round of meds just to make sure as the vet was concerned because they had gone left untreated for so long. Vet said it may be a chronic issue and its hard to say what long term meds or IF any will be needed, but they look really good now. She is crate trained, rides nicely in the car (crated), and gets along with the other dogs in the house. We have not seen her around cats and children. She is a sweet older girl who likes a soft place to nap and cuddle on the couch or in bed with her person.\n\nThis animal is up to date on all shots, dewormed, and spayed/neutered. They have been heartworm tested (negative) and on prevention. The adoption fee is $150.00 If you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an application.\n\nhttp://www.ajssearchandrescue.org/adoption-application",

IF THIS LISTING IS STILL POSTED, SHE IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION - THE LISTING WILL BE REMOVED WHEN WE ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS.**\n\nLuna is a 6 year old Husky mix who came to us as an owner surrender because she's not a fan of small children. She is a very sweet girl though and now that she's fully vetted and we've had some time to get to know her - she's ready to find her forever home! \n\nLuna loves going for walks and playing outside, an active outdoorsy family would be ideal for her. She will not be adopted to a home with young children as she is not comfortable around them but she would do likely okay with older children (12+). Luna is picky about her canine friends - she does get along well with some but can be overbearing with others. On walks she will pull to get towards other dogs so she wears a harness and walks fairly nicely with that. She would do best in a home without cats. \n\nLuna knows \"sit\", \"shake paw\", \"high five\" and \"lay down\" and with training, she would love to learn lots more! She has not been crate trained and is okay left alone in the home for short periods. Luna may have a bit of separation anxiety so likely would not do well left for long periods of time alone at home. She loves to go for car rides and is friendly with all the people she meets - she's even great for handling at the vet! \n\nIf you think Luna might just be the perfect companion for you - please head to our website to complete an adoption application. Her adoption fee is $450 and includes up to date vaccines, fecal test and deworming, wellness bloodwork and heartworm test, spay and microchip.",

Scrappy has not been around cats so we cannot vouch for him being good with them. He has also never been around children but is sweet tempered. Because of his size and goofiness, we are recommending a home with children 10 years of age or older.\n\nHe is already microchipped, up to date on all vaccines, neutered, heartworm negative, started on heartworm prevention and flea and tick prevention.",

            "description": "Angela and her sister were abandoned on the side of the road on a crate and taken in by our county shelter. They were completely terrified and unsocialized and kind shelter staff knew they would respond better out of a kennel situation so they were transferred to Dogwood. They are learning house training, leash training and are great in their cozy beds in their crates all night. The girls love to be held and to snuggle on a lap but will need patient adopters willing to go slow while they learn to feel safe.  Angela is around 4 years old and weighs 12 pounds.\n\nPlease follow us on social media at https://www.instagram.com/dogwoodanimalrescue/ or https://www.facebook.com/DogwoodAnimalRescue/ for updates on Angela  and all our Dogwood animals.\n\nMaking a difference one animal at a time.\n\nTaking applications at https://www.dogwoodanimalrescue.org\n",

I am so excited for 2021 to be the year I find my forever home!\n\nI am happy-go-lucky and I am adjusting so great to my new rescued life. I am a young at heart, early senior! I am a very well balanced dog with fun playful energy but I also enjoy quiet time.\nI love to play with toys - whether its fetching small tennis balls or playing tug of war where I let out my ferocious and adorable growls! I love to play bow and my tail is constantly wagging. I love to go on walks and play in the fenced backyard. I love to run up and down the hallways and zoom around the house.\nI also like to take naps in my cozy bed and I love lounging around too; I have my own space in the guest bedroom/office. I love to work on treat toys, kongs, greenies and take nice long naps.\n\nI can be a little squirmy and sometimes I use my legs to kick off of my foster parents when I am being held but that is usually because I am so excited and in my past I likely wasn't held very much. But I am really gentle overall and I have started to give kisses. As far as potty training goes, I was a street dog but I have not had any accidents inside the house! But before I was neutered mid-January I would try to mark corners, so my foster Mom kept a really good eye on me! Since being neutered I have tried to lift my leg far less and my foster Mom always catches me and redirects me and it works great! Besides working on that, I am fully potty trained on a schedule.\n\nI am dog friendly but do better with dogs who give me space or that are disinterested and are not bothered by me zooming around. I like dogs more that are my size or not as interested in me. I am cat friendly and I do not mind cats at all. I would do great as a single dog or with a friendly dog my size and energy level.\n\nI am a quiet boy and I would do well in all kinds of home settings! I am really friendly to new people but due to my age, size and history I would do best in a forever home that if there are kids, they are older, respectful kids.\n\nI had some itchiness under my neck when I arrived but that has almost gone away. I also have a small cough but I am on a standard antibiotic to help with that. I also got some dental work done and had some missing teeth prior, so my foster Mom softens my dry food with water and mixes that with canned food and I LOVE it!\n\nI am really excited to find my forever home and I would make a really joyful and loving companion to any person or family. My foster home has a large fenced in backyard that is great for COVID safe meet and greets.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!

She gets bored easy sometimes so she needs an active lifestyle. She's good at staying in the yard and comes back when she's told to come back if she goes to far. She is a very smart dog, she knows how to sit and stay out of the kitchen when we eat. She loves belly rubs and likes to follow us around the house.\n\nShe is potty trained but only had a couple accidents in the house when she first moved in. She loves to play with all sorts of toys and needs the kind that will last long, if kids toys are left out she may chew them up.\n\nWe have 4 kids 11, 7, 3 and 1, Pearl will let them on cuddle with her so she does very well with kids!\n\nShe will need slow introductions to anyone new she meets as she can be nervous around new people. Once she gets to know you she's just fine. She is kennel trained and if left alone for long periods she may need to be in one.\n\nShe's been allowed to roam free in the house while I am at work. I have security cameras, and she literally just sleeps on the couch all day. Pearl is truly a sweet and playful dog. We also have another dog and they get along great. Pearl really enjoys having an energetic dog playmate, that can keep up with her running and chasing. She is great with puppies.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue.

            "description": "Annabelle came to us emaciated and in rough shape. She has since gained weight and recovered from kennel cough. She has been dewormed and is on heartworm and flea/tick preventive. Annabelle was spayed, microchipped and vaccinated on 1/28/2021.\n\nAnnabelle is two years old but still has a lot of puppy play in her. She is very well behaved - she is good about chewing her toys and going outside to potty. She does like to mouth when she plays and, solely for that reason, we are seeking an adopter who does not have young children.\n\nAnnabelle has been around another dog of similar size and did very well; she would love a playmate of similar size and age.\n\nAnnabelle greatly enjoys peanut butter filled Kongs, her furry Kong bear, tennis balls and chew toys. She is sweet and can be a great cuddler. She does like to mouth during play and will need someone to work with her on some of her manners (as most pups do). She is super smart - she caught on to using the dog door quickly, is a pro at doggy puzzles and loves to work her treat ball.\n\nAnnabelle loves to wear her jacket when she heads out for a walk. She is working on loose leash walking (though she zigzags more than she pulls). She will be a wonderful walker with a little patience and training. \n\nBully experience is always a plus - (non-electric) fully fenced yard also scores extra points. Must reside in a Pit Bull-friendly city without Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) banning animals that appear to be Pit Bulls.\n\n",

Once she does though, she attaches herself to you and shows nothing but pure love!! She is an energetic girl, who will need help with manners/basic obedience. She is going to need someone patient and willing to take the time introducing her to new things at her own pace. She has not been introduced to kids yet. She seems to be fine with other dogs, and we will be able to introduce her to more once she is healed from her spay. She doesn\u2019t seem to mind cats.

She needs to be in a home with one person or a home that is committed to training through this behavior. \n\nCookie needs a home without young children. She also wants her human to be all hers, so other dogs that think they can sit in your lap too are not allowed by Cookie! In a home setting, Cookie is a very affectionate  individual that loves her person. While she may not take up much space physically, she has a big personality. To adopt Cookie, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Tiffany is a very sweet, but very timid, brindle pittie girl who is looking for a calm and patient home. She is very nervous around new things and environments, and is hoping to find a family willing to take everything slow and help her build up her confidence. Tiffany would love to have a male dog friend to play with, but also help show her the ropes in her new home. Tiffany will need a home with a secure, fenced yard, attached to the home as she is still learning how to walk on a leash and isn't fully house-trained. She will potty when loose in our fenced yard, but isn't super confident on a leash yet (flight risk) so having a safe yard will be a key to her success in her new home. Once Tiffany has built some trust in her human friends, she is quite the cuddle bug and will climb right in to your lap for attention. She is also quite the silly and playful girl, and she loves to play with stuffy toys. She is going to be the kind of girl that bonds very strongly with her people and will want to always be where you are. When it comes to kids, we think Tiffany will do best in a home with respectful kids aged 12+ as she will take time to really settle in and adjust. She is not appropriate for cats in the home. \nHave an inquiry? Want to adopt?

            "description": "Lacey is a cute little scruffy dog. She has demonstrated being a darter and a digger. She will need to be monitored while outside to ensure she does not run. She is a pretty shy - she will attached to a person though. She much prefers to be with a person, sitting on a lap, rather than playing with toys. \n\nPUPPIES AND OTHER HIGHLY-ADOPTABLE DOGS DISCLAIMER:\nPuppies and other highly-adoptable dogs (small dogs or desirable-breed dogs) at PPA! are very high in demand and usually have several interested adopters. Inquiring about a dog, meeting a dog, and even applying for a dog does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt the dog. \n\nOnly one household will be able to adopt each dog, which means all other interested households will inevitably and unfortunately be disappointed. Please consider this in your search and set your expectations accordingly. Please also consider that adult dogs do not typically have competing adopters, and they need forever homes, too! \n\nPPA! does not allow the adoption of dogs who are related (e.g., littermates or mom and pup) to the same household for behavioral reasons.",

I am young and have lots of puppy energy so an active home will be good.  A fenced yard is a must for me but I also would like to be able to live indoors sometimes as well.  I am a medium sized dog weighing around 40 pounds.  I am also learning how to walk on a leash and a few commands.  I love to please the volunteers.  I keep my kennel clean almost all of the time so I may already be house trained.  I am ready to go so why don't you come and meet me?  I will be waiting.  Adoption fee is $160.00.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please fill out our short Adoption Application to start the adoption process. An adoption application can be completed & submitted on our website yorkadoptapet.com. For more information on any of the dogs available for adoption contact kim@yorkadoptapet.com . All applications need to be approved prior to adoption and approval may take up to 1 week.",

            "description": "Hank is an 8-month-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. Hank is higher energy, and good with children over 8 years old. He would also do best in a home with another canine companion. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "PUPDATE 2\n\nMickey has been with us for a few weeks now and has settled in wonderfully. He\u2019s a really entertaining dog to have around! We took him for a short run and he did pretty well. With just a little practice he could definitely be a good running buddy. He also went for a hike and LOVED all the new sights and smells. I can\u2019t stress enough how good he is in the car\u2014he just curls up and naps til we stop.\n\nSince he\u2019s met a few more dogs, we\u2019ve realized Mickey is dog-selective, meaning he gets along great with some dogs, but others, not so much. He does best with submissive dogs and is not a fan of other dominant dogs. Speaking of \u201cdominant\u201d dogs, while Mick will definitely elect himself leader of your household if you let him, he\u2019s not the kind of dog that challenges you for control every single day. I think he\u2019s actually much more comfortable being a follower, so once he realizes that you\u2019re the boss, he happily falls into line.\n\nMickey\u2019s leash reactivity is also improving a lot with the prong collar and treats for distraction. When he first got here, he would bark and lunge at any dog he saw. Now we\u2019re down to just whining!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a dog who\u2019s a solid mix of activity and snuggles, Mickey is your guy!\n\nPUPDATE 1\n\nThis is Mickey, aka Mick, Mickelson, or Moose. He's a big goofy guy waiting for his forever home!\n\nMick is a medium-high energy dude, and he gets about an hour total of walks per day, generally divided into a morning and afternoon walk. During the day, he goes to Dog Dog Daycare (east side of Madison) a few days a week and hangs out at home the rest of the time. As long as he gets sufficient exercise, he's happy to lounge, nap on the couch or in his crate, or play with toys while you're working. When we leave the house, Mickey goes in his crate. He'll whine for a few minutes but calms down quickly, especially if you throw a peanut butter-stuffed Kong in with him. He actually really likes his crate and will go in there on his own just to nap.\n\nMickey is 100% potty trained! He doesn't have a way to tell you he wants to go out, but he does great on a schedule--he goes out twice a day for walks and then once more before bedtime. He walks very nicely on a leash with a prong collar. He is reactive towards other dogs on walks, but he responds to the prong collar well and we're working on redirecting his attention when he sees another dog. Off leash, he's generally good with other dogs. He's still a puppy at heart and typically wants to play with every dog he meets. He can be a little overwhelming for dogs that don't want to play 24/7! He's possessive of his food towards other dogs so he should be fed separately.\n\nI've never seen him with kids, but I suspect he wouldn't do great with younger kids just because of his size and energy level. Mickey still gets puppy zoomies where he'll charge around the house at top speed--he earned one of his nicknames because he's about as coordinated as a newborn baby moose! He loves all adults he's ever met, inside and outside the house.\n\nMickey thrives with structure. He's very smart and food-motivated, which makes him lots of fun to train! He knows (and is good at) sit, down and shake. We're working on come and stay. He needs an owner that will be a strong leader, otherwise Mick will decide he's going to be the boss. He doesn't necessarily need an experienced owner, but he probably wouldn't be good for someone with little to no dog experience.\n\nMickey has been lots of fun to have in our house. He's a great cuddler and is super good in the car. He'll entertain himself with toys--he especially likes bones, puzzle toys, and stuffed toys that he can de-stuff. Are you ready to be his forever home??\n\n",

Freya is a super sweet, playful puppy. Since Freya is a pup, she would do best with an active family with older children because of her sharp puppy teeth and fun loving puppy play. Freya will need time and patience from her new family to learn how to be the best doggie she can be. She is crate trained and working on her potty training, manners and walking on a leash. Freya will do best in a home with a yard to run and play. If you would like to meet Freya, please fill out an app and his foster mom will be in touch within 48 hours.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay, deworming, 3 sets of puppy vaccines, rabies, micro chip and first month of heart prevention. LHS adoption fee is 375.00.\n\nFull grown Freya will weigh 80-90 pounds.\n\nFill out an app and her foster mom will be in touch within 48 hours. She will be able to go to her forever homes at 7 weeks of age on 1/29.\n\nhttps://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/\n\nDFW/local area adoptions only due to vaccines and neuter that will be due in April 2021.\n\nWe do not have a facility to house the dogs in our program.

He came with an existing wound on his face that is being treated at Cedar Bend.\n\nAGE: Approximately 1 year.\n\nTRICKS & COMMANDS: Sit\n\nABOUT KING: King is a very happy boy with a lot of energy! He tries his best to play with toys and enjoy treats, but sometimes he can get distracted easily. \n\nKing is a social butterfly and gets excited to tell his humans all about himself. He loves to play but needs a little bit of help learning some manners. Because of King's high energy personality, he would love an active home that can give him an outlet for some of that energy. He seems to enjoy being around other dogs and could do great with another doggy friend to run around with!\n\nKing would benefit most in a home with husky breed experience.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

She is so looking forward to calling your home her furever after. \n\nwww.LuckyDogRefuge.com \n\nREAD THE FOLLOWING FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR THIS PET:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.LuckyDogRefuge.com, under the \u201cApply Now\u201d tab \n\nor \n\nat https://forms.gle/LXKMKSnagxLSad668.\n\n- Do NOT use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible. If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES.\n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

I was  a stray dog at a very high kill shelter and I was pulled and brought to this shelter so I would get a second chance.  I love other dogs but I need an active friend in my new home.  I am most definitely still a puppy the volunteers say.  I will require a fenced yard and I would love to be indoors at least part of the time. I may need a little bit of house training as I do have accidents occasionally in my kennel.  I LOVE people and will have no problem with anyone as I am very socialized!  I am ready to meet my new family.    See you soon!  Adoption fee is $160.00.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please fill out our short Adoption Application to start the adoption process. An adoption application can be completed & submitted on our website yorkadoptapet.com. For more information on any of the dogs available for adoption contact kim@yorkadoptapet.com . All applications need to be approved prior to adoption and approval may take up to 1 week. \n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName: Minne DOB: November 2018 Weight: 66 lbs Adoption Fee: $0\n\n*Minne was diagnosed with Addison's disease and will need to stay on daily medication and her bloodwork monitored for Percorten injections. Depending on the veterinary clinic, we have estimated her monthly veterinary costs to be $300 a month*\n\nPlease see attached article for more information on Addison's Disease in dogs. https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/addisons-disease-in-dogs-overview\n\nHello friends, my name is Minne! I was saved from a very rough situation but I am happily looking to my new future ahead! I am a huge snuggle bug that absolutely adores my people. One of my all-time favorite activities is to cuddle up in front of the warm fireplace.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of toys of all kinds, especially the ones that squeak, those ones are the best! I get a little carried away while playing with toys, they usually end up mangled and torn by the time I am done with them. I enjoy playing ball too and am currently working on \"drop it\" when I bring it back to you. Some of the super fun tricks that I already know are; sit, stay, lay down & shake! I'm working really hard on a few other manners, like walking on a leash and not jumping up on you when I am excited or playing. I'm a quick learner though and extremely eager to please, so I know I can master both in no time! I currently walk best with a gentle leader, rather than a regular leash or harness. I am extremely motivated by treats and toys, which makes teaching me new tricks a breeze! I'm an active girl that has a lot of energy to burn off. I love going on walks and spending time outside doing zoomies around the yard! I would love a home with a fenced yard so I know that I'll always have somewhere to run and play. I like to find sticks and other objects to chew on while I'm outside, so be sure to keep an eye on me! I don't even mind this chilly weather we've had, just throw a sweater on to keep me warm and I'm good to go!\n\nI am great in my kennel when you are away from home, I will even go in on command. However, if you are home, I just want to spend time hanging out with you and I will make sure you are aware of that. If I must be kenneled while you are home, melatonin and a blanket over the kennel help me stay calm. I am rocking the whole potty-training thing; I just need you to keep me on a consistent schedule so I don't have a slip-up. I occasionally might have an accident in the house or in my kennel but I'm continuing to work very hard on it. I've even learned how to signal that I need to go out by doing circles by the door or pawing at the door.\n\nI love my humans so much that sometimes I will guard them when other dogs are around. My foster family thinks some of these behaviors might be anxiety from my past and are hopeful that with time I will overcome them. In fact, a basic obedience class would likely do wonders for some of these behaviors, help me build my confidence, and create a great foundation to form a bond with my new family. Ideally, I would love a home where I can have people all to myself!\n\nIn the meantime, if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster-based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.",

He was abandoned, and someone found him and locked him up in a gravel pit where he stayed until we rescued him. He was starving for love and affection and a good Samaritan discovered his wiggle-butt and alerted a contact of ours out in GA.  (his tail never stops wagging and it wags his whole backend!)  We arranged to get him out,  to a vet and transported to us here in NJ.\nHe is an eternally happy, very smart boy that just wants to play and enjoy life!! He is SOLID and a bit of a bull in a china shop, because he just wants to romp on to the next adventure!  Seems to like other dogs and want to play. I have not put that to the test yet. No cats. 100% clean in his crate and seems housebroken. \n\nRocky is neutered and about 2 yo. He seems like a \"guys dog\" - all big and tough looking, but he is a total complete mush!\n\nIf interested in Rocky, please send a message, or an email to SusanRescue@aol.com.",

Cleveland is a smart boy that needs a family that can keep his mind busy so he does not get into trouble.  We have been told that he is house trained and does well with kids.  He dos not do well with cats.  Cleveland is a smart boy and knows sit and lay.  He walks well on a leash and seems to love everyone that he comes in contact with.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an online application at  http://guernseysheriff.com/dog-shelter/  Completed adoption application does not guarantee adoption approval!! \n      Thank you for looking at dogs from the Guernsey County Dog Warden Dept. We are a county run facility in Cambridge, OH, We are NOT a no kill shelter! Unfortunately we must euthanize due to illness or aggression. Adoption fees are $125 for Guernsey County adopters and $160 for dogs adopted out of Guernsey County and Cell Dogs are $185. This includes spay/neuter, first shots, rabies, and microchip!  Most dogs will be required to be  spayed/ neutered before leaving shelter or a appointment will be scheduled before leaving the shelter.   Please talk to shelter staff for more information. \n     We only accept cash. We cannot take checks, debit or credit cards. You may also call the shelter between the hours of 9-5 Mon through Fri and 9-4 on Saturday, for more information and our fax number if you would like us to fax you an application.  You can also visit the shelter between the hours of 11-4 Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  If coming from out of town, please call first to make sure the dog you are interested in is still available. Approved rescues also welcome!!!!",

Sometimes Coquito can be a little dominant & can be on the pushy side with other dogs so a perfect fit is necessary for other furry friends. He is amazing on leash and is house trained. He clearly loves the outdoors. Hikes and new adventures are his thing. Definitely is not a fan of a crate and requires a fenced in yard for long sniffs in the grass. He does well in the car but can be quite the master of escape so special care should be given when outside. Coquito can go go go & we mean quick!\n\nInterested in adopting me? To fill out an application visit 3 Hearts 4 Paws. Please note: we generally do not adopt out of state unless it is within 1-2 hours of us. Currently due to COVID we are unable to accommodate out of state adoptions.",

            "description": "Apply to adopt at leadrescue.org. We do not adopt out of state. We only adopt in Illinois and within 50 miles of downtown Chicago.\n\nFoster: He looks like he just got groomed. Nails cut. Smells nice.\nMe: Has he barked at all? Supposedly that\u2019s why surrendered.\nFoster: Because they couldn\u2019t keep up with grooming?\nMe: Oh no, because of the barking. But we have had dogs be given up because of grooming or minor things, so I don\u2019t put it past anyone anymore.\n\nThis guy was surrendered to the shelter because he \u201cbarks too much\u201d. I wish that wasn\u2019t so ambiguous but it\u2019s all what was provided. So that doesn\u2019t tell me why he barks, if he actually barks a lot, what is considered barks too much, is his bark annoying and they just had enough, or did they live in an apartment and people complained about said barking? Do you see how this could be unfair to any dog? They can\u2019t tell you why they were given up so it would be just grand if their owners gave a smidge more info so we don\u2019t have to figure it out ourselves. To be completely honest, even I was hesitant to take him when I heard that. But then I figured two things: let\u2019s get him out of the shelter and see what this barking nonsense is about and if he is a Pomsky, then whoever is adopting already knows they are getting two very vocal breeds. The shelter worker even said, \u201cHe\u2019s not barking here.\u201d Ok, so Rooster does have an off button.\n\nAnd yet again, I am glad we went with our gut.\n\nRooster is a 1 year old, 20 lb Pomeranian Husky (although he seriously looks like he got the Husky main genes) that lived with cats and kids, but really gets excited to play with other dogs. He is overly friendly and playful and despite being relinquished, we can tell he did live a good life prior. He can\u2019t wait to go outside that he knows how to grab his leash and jumps up in celebration. Imagine being that excited about stepping outside your home. Oh wait, that was quarantine lol. He walks nicely on a leash and is crate trained, barking only to let you know he\u2019s gotta go potty. However he is not super housebroken, being a marker. He had an accident in the house after an hour walk and then hid behind a curtain. So although he knew he shouldn\u2019t have done so, he seemed to feel extreme guilt. But he was just neutered so hoping it will subside. Otherwise best to stock up on dude diapers.\n\nAnd so far, the only real time he barks, makes a peep, howls, whiney Husky normal sounds, is when he hears regular everyday noise! So your typical DOG.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog people assume you got from a breeder, and heck if we know if Rooster actually did, apply at leadrescue.org!",

I am a six year old lab mix. My foster dad thinks I am part Heeler because of my great ears and markings. Don't let my white nose fool you, it is not old age, it is my markings. My best years are still ahead of me. I had surgery on my knees a few months back but am now 100% recovered and had no setbacks. Luckily I ended up with a great foster that took me to physical therapy 2-3 times a week for months and I healed up perfectly and don't foresee any future complications. With my new bionic knees I am now able to do all my favorite things again. I really love to play fetch, hike, swim, pretty much anything outside. I am at a point in my life where I am fine with just chilling with my humans or myself. My foster dad says I am the most obedient and well trained foster he has had. I listen extremely well and absolutely love my humans, so much so I prefer to be the only pet in the house. If you are looking for an amazing dog who doesn't need a lot of training, has good manners, listens extremely well and just wants to please her people, check me out. That being said, I need a strong, experienced, confident and kind leader. Aubry would do best in a home without cats or. young. children.You can see more of me and my story on Facebook on my foster's page, Puckett Robertson.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

I have some fear issues and I need slow introductions with both people and other dogs, but I do warm up quickly. I come alive when I get to chase a frisbee or ball and I'm really good about dropping it at my handler's feet so the games can continue. I could live with a calm canine buddy. I am looking for a calm, confident handler who has GSD experience and is well versed in reading dog body language and can meet my mental and physical stimulation needs. If you are interested, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application. My adoption fee is $350.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

They are ok around older kids and respectful cats.\n\nBoth are neutered and up to date on all vaccines and preventives and have a health certificate.\n\nEmail for an application: alphadogrescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Maggie! I'm about 2.5 yrs old and a sweet, lovable super-mutt. I've been with my foster family for a few months after delivering an amazing litter of puppies. I was a rockstar mom and took great care of them. Now I'm spayed and ready to find my forever home. I LOVE going on walks (although I don't really understand leash pressure yet but that's just because I'm SO excited to be outside doing dog stuff, I can't help it!) - smelling all the smells is the best!! I do great when running with my foster dad -- I don't pull and I stick close by. Another bonus is I'm house trained. I'm very responsive when my foster parents say no. But I am vocal, so sometimes when we're cuddling, if you stop, I will tell you to start petting me again! And while we are on the subject of cuddling, I can't get enough of it. Head scratches, belly rubs, even hugs, I love to put my paws on your shoulders so we are nose to nose. What can I say? I'm a lover! I also love my foster brother. Puppy fight club is probably my third favorite thing after walking and cuddling. It took me several weeks to warm up to my foster brother but eventually I realized we were all in the same pack and we've been fast friends ever since. Because I'm slow to warm up, I'll need my family to be patient with me and slow with introductions. I will do best with an older brother who is chill and friendly with other dogs. I've come a long way with my training and there is always room to improve! If you watch my videos you'll see I'm great at waiting for my food until I'm released and recently I've learned how to wait before my foster parents take me on a walk. I don't like being crated but for short periods of time its okay. I really prefer to be able to roam. The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00 + tax and that includes their vaccinations, spay or neuter, rabies and microchip. Our dogs are also heartworm negative (or we will cover their treatment). To start the process please visit our website and fill out the adoption application (www.dfwrescueme.org) and from there the foster family can answer any questions and arrange a time to meet.",

Norma was surrendered to us along with her 5 siblings because they couldn't manage 6 large dogs. \n\nNorma is a quiet dog who is good with other non-hyper dogs.  She tested well with our kennel cat, so we don't think she'll give them any problems.  She's good with all adults, but she needs a quiet home without kids that has patience and understands she will need time to blossom.  She will also need a fenced yard.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ then email Debbie@BigFluffyDogs.com. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Rufio took over leadership duties when Peter Pan left Neverland. It seems to be the same story for me.  \n\nHi my name is  Rufio. I am 2-3yr and up to date on my shots, neutered, microchipped and am overall healthy. I am a pretty sociable guy and am always up for walks and snuggles. I am very smart having to survive on the streets most of the early stages of my life. I have some scars and road rash but my spirit is still a joyful and happy one. \n\nI was named after the Lost Boys Rufio. You see I took on duties of spending time with the homeless and made many friends along the way. I knew we were lost and we needed one another to lean on so I kept them company and watched over them. One kind homeless individual thought I deserved a real home so that\u2019s when WTWTA and a partner Rescue Hands to Paws stepped in. It\u2019s been a wild ride for me so far, being a free spirit I didn't want to get caught but eventually I was gently led to them and now I\u2019ve met so many people and pups I realized being in a home aint so bad! Everyone says I\u2019m quite handsome and Ill give you lots of kisses when you show me attention. The staff of WTWTA love my happy trot and gallop. I have quite the playful side to me.   \n\nIf you have pets I need to meet them first to ensure we are a good fit. Im a sweet boy but also big and would want a partner who can be sweet like me. I am a young boy at heart so I like to play and run about so a yard with a fence is perfect! I want to feel free and have fun but be secure at the same time.\n\n",

            "description": "Geo is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nGeo is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1.5 years \nWeight: ~64lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: No, he will need continued training for this. He has only been left alone for an hour max and did not settle easily/was vocal. Would do best with adopter that can continue training and doesn't have thin walls.\nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but we suspect he would do well\nIdeal home: Geo is looking for a home that can be dedicated to work on him with his separation anxiety. He will do best in a home that doesn't share walls as he is vocal when left solo. He is heartworm positive and will need to remain on restricted activity for the next ~9 months until he retests negative.\n\nGeo is an overall great dog who just needs a bit of TLC and patience, because he's still a baby at heart. He loves exploring on walks, and doesn't have an aggressive bone on his body. He needs extra patience when getting used to unusual things, such as certain stairways or doorways. With ample treats and his favorite--some turkey deli meat--he is a very quick learner. While he is less energetic because he's on heartworm medication, he still loves to play when given the opportunity. He chills at home during the day but loves to be showered with pets and smooches. XO! He's not much of a snuggler, because he likes to stick to his own. But that does not mean he doesn't love affection. \n\nGeo is heartworm positive and will be undergoing treatment at our Ellis Veterinary Clinic. OTAT will cover the cost of his treatment until he is heartworm negative. He is currently on the first phase (Doxy) and will require injections on future dates (TBD). He will need remain on restricted exercise for the next ~9 months. For information on the heartworm treatment process, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nGeo's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date (2/18/21 at SNIP Society in Joliet) and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

I am housebroken and good with kids, dogs and cats!  I know sit and paw.  The only thing I need a little help with is walking on a leash but in no time - I'll be a pro.\n\nSince I've come to the shelter they have made sure that I'm up to date on vaccinations, fixed, and also have a microchip. All I need now is someone super nice to come adopt me!\n\nAdoptions are conducted by appointment only with a pre-approved application. Please call the shelter at 724-539-2544 and leave a voicemail with your information and interest in adopting. We will call you back to do an application with you by phone. Once your adoption application is approved, we will setup an appointment for you to come to the shelter and meet the pet you are interested in. Please be patient in receiving a call back - we are experiencing a very high volume of calls each day with a limited staff.\n",

            "description": "Molly is a cute little black chi mix and her daughter Shorty is a darling little white and black girl. They are tightly bonded with each other. Shorty is about 2 yrs old and Molly is about 5 yrs old. Molly is more trusting with strangers and a total love bug once she feels comfortable iwth you. She will play, but really just likes to snuggle. Shorty is shy of people at first and slower to trust, and will bark at new people that visit. Shorty lobves to play and is constantly asking Molly to play with her. They both love to get snuggles when they get to know you. Both are housetrained with a doggie door. Since we are asking for them to stay together, they have a 2 for 1 adoption fee, so it will be $200 total. for both of them.\n\nAll available dogs are spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested, and given a broad spectrum dewormer .

It was only a few days after being taken in by his foster parents that he had also tested positive for parvovirus. Jojo is now completely healthy, up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heart-worm negative, and micro-chipped!\n\nJoJo is not fully house, or kennel trained yet, but he is slowly starting to learn outside is the best place to use the bathroom. JoJo has already learned how to \u201csit\u201d and is working on other basic commands. \n\nJoJo is being fostered with one of his brothers from his liter and loves to play with his liter mate Moose. JoJo loves to be outside and sunbathe in the backyard. JoJo has done well with big dogs and loves to be chased by his big brother Trooper, a 100-pound Dogo Argentino. \n\nJoJo loves chew toys and hanging outside, but also loves to cuddle with his owner. JoJo loves everyone he meets and is not shy of strangers but loves to be around his owners most. He is not afraid of a game of tug-of-war with dogs 80 pounds heavier than him, but smart enough to know not to mess with their bones. Potty training is going well and JoJo is getting the hang of where to use the bathroom with a little positive reinforcement. JoJo would love to have another dog to play with but will do great in a home with or without pets. \n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt this pet at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application!",

Prince is very much enjoying his golden years ,and enjoys taking life at his own pace! This dashing fellow enjoys a warm bed to snooze on, and likes taking a sun bath in the yard each afternoon. \n\nPrince has limited sight, and will need some help learning where everything is in his new home. This clever boy picks up patterns quickly and does not take long to adjust to new environments. He can be a bit nervous around new dogs due to his limited vision, and would prefer a home where he can be the one and only pet. \n\nAs a more orderly dog, his ideal home would be a quiet household, full of relaxation, and without a whole lot of hustle and bustle. Because Prince can startle easily, he politely request a home without children. If this gentleman sounds like the sweet senior you have been looking for, then schedule an adoption appointment today.",

She is a very sweet, confident girl who LOVES to run around and play with toys and play with her foster sister.\n\n She is very energetic, but can also entertain herself with fun toys and quality chews. She loves to be right by your side and cuddle with you after playing. Her  favorite toys are squeaky toys that she can carry around and squeak. She would do best in a fenced in yard. \n\nShe would do best in a home with older children due to her nipping and teething stage right now.

She loves me and follows me around wherever I go. She has jumped up on my lap a few times, but does get scared and jumps back down. She can't bring herself to go outside yet, this Oklahoma girl stands at the door and shivers. Good thing she has good aim on the potty pad. She is looking for a home with another dog to play with. Cats are OK, but they don't like to play much. Because of her history in her early life, she needs a family with patience that will take their time gaining her trust. Jules is a sweetheart who needs to learn how loving families work. Best with older kids who will give her space\n\n*Please note Jules is from a hoarding situation and needs an expreiced adoptivehome, who is able to provide plenty of time and patience as Jules is scared of things that normal pups would not be*\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs). Ruff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.

A few staff members gave him a bath and he did really well for it! He\u2019ll need many more baths from some urine staining due to neglect ?. \n\nCowboy is your classic dog that grew up with no manners. He doesn\u2019t understand that he can\u2019t jump on you with his claws digging into your skin. He doesn\u2019t understand that nipping for fun is bad. Because of this, we require a child free home. Cowboy is SO SWEET. But he just wasn\u2019t taught the proper manners that he should have been. He will need someone willing to put that work in ????\n\nPlease bring your dogs and cats for a meet and greet since we don\u2019t have a history on stray dogs. Cats in a hard carrier! \n\nWhen you adopt a dog, PLEASE research decompression. This is key to a dog adapting to a home. \n\n\n\nAll dogs listed as on HOLD are NOT available for viewing by the public, unless you are their owner. \nOnce a dog is no longer on HOLD, it is able to be viewed by the public, participate in meet & greets, and be adopted!\n\nAdoption cost per dog is $99.00 (puppies under 6 months of age are $150.00). The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

I am a very sweet and playful boy who absolutely loves nothing more than getting lots and lots of attention. I love to play with other dogs, particularly big ones like myself. I think that I'd do best in a home with older children or adults-only, simply due to my size and strength. I be a good fit for a first-time adopter, as long as they have a great big yard for me to run around and play in. I'd love a busy home with lots of visitors for me to meet and play with! I may even be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you on your daily activities, if you wanted to! I could definitely use some additional training, but I do appear to have potty-training pretty much under control. I love to go for long leashed walks and spend lots of time playing with my toys.",

I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size and nothing would make me happier than to get to be a family pet in a home with children that can love and play with me. I'd love to find either an experienced or a first-time dog owner in any type of home situation, where I can be comfortable and happy. I am a particularly vocal hound so I may not be the best fit for someone living in an apartment. A home that's busy and gets frequent visitors would be perfect for me because I'm just so excited to do almost everything! I may even be the type of pup that you want to bring out and about with you in public as you do your daily activities. I could benefit from continued training, particularly because I'm not quite potty-trained yet, but I do love to go for nice long walks on a leash and I'm particularly skilled at it, if I do say so myself!",

Once I was groomed, I became a diva! I love life again. I love my foster mom, treats, toys, and warm beds. I need to be an only fur baby. I do love all humans, but I am very shy with greetings.\n\nMcKenzie is very sweet but also very timid. We are looking for a home where someone is home most of the day and there is an experienced dog owner that will have the patience to help McKenzie gain confidence.\n\nPlease consider making this adorable girl a member of your family. As we are a foster based rescue, we do require a completed application to be submitted before we arrange a meet. This can be found on our website at : https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1\n\n$150 adoption fee includes core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, heart worm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), microchip and registration, spay/neuter, wormer and flea and heart worm prevention while the dog is in our care.

She was brought to BarkVille's attention by volunteers who knew that LaLa's owners were keeping her chained outside 100% of the time and were breeding her. Thankfully, our volunteers convinced LaLa's owners to surrender LaLa to Rescue so she could have a better life (they wanted money, of course, but LaLa was worth every penny!). She is a friendly, quiet, social girl who has been impressing her foster family with how smart & eager she is to please. She learned to sit, lay down, stay, and give high five's all in one day! She is extremely trainable and does not beg at meal times (she stays quietly in her designated spot while her family eats until they call her). She loves people, other dogs, and is afraid of cats! She is a medium energy, playful girl who is kid friendly, likes wrestling with other dogs, and enjoys relaxing in the house with her people. She has good leash manners, but gets nervous when loud cars or trucks zoom by. It'll take her a little time to get used to the world beyond her chain, but she's getting more and more comfortable everyday. She enjoys going to the farm with her foster family when they ride their horses and she behaves well around the other animals! She is spayed, fully vaccinated, microchipped and is being housebroken & crate trained in her foster home. Her foster family says that LaLa is SUPER AMAZING, that they love her dearly, and that she will be a wonderful, devoted companion for the lucky person/family who adopts her!\n\nCopy & paste this video into your browser to see another cool video of LaLa with her human foster sister!\nhttps://youtu.be/zvtXwk-q034\n\nFor more information about LaLa, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

Everything about Jerry is super-sized from his extra girthy dad body to his big ol' blocky head and most importantly his loving heart! \n\nHe was found as a stray and now he's ready for a home (hopefully with sturdy furniture). Jerry loves everyone and is working hard on his impulse control but he can be a jumpy boy so he would do best in an adult-only home or a home with older kids that can handle an 80-pound dog heading their way at max speed. Jerry thinks other dogs are neat but some find him to be a bit too much so a meet and greet here at the shelter would be needed to ensure a good match.\n\nIf you have what Jerry needs send an email to our Behavior Program Manager Andy at asalis@andersonanimalshelter.org to find out how to meet him!",

I finally got my freedom ride to Buffalo and cant wait to find my forever family. I am very skeptical of new things (there isnt much going on in a shelter) but Im learning how great this world is. I dont mind being in my crate at all, when my foster mom works I sleep in there with the door open. Im a little unsure of men and little kids and might take a little more time warming up to them but I love my foster mom and older foster sister (17). I try to protect them from my scary foster dad, with lots of treat Im learning hes not really scary. My foster mom calls me gentle giant, because I am a big boy but oh so very sweet once I know Im safe. I walk well on a leash and listen pretty good to corrections. Ive only had a couple accidents when I first got in my foster home but since then Ive been very good. I love to give kisses, but be careful my big tail can take out a coffee table when Im excited cause it wags so fast! \n\nMy fosters favorite thing is that I love to be close to them. Snuggling in the teenagers bed while she does her homework is my favorite.\n\nIf you are interested in Jacque please apply at https://www.nickelcitycaninerescue.org/adopt-a-dog or message the rescue if you are already pre-approved.",

Im Princess Buttercup and Im here to tell you all about how much I love to snuggle and make new friends! I have quickly warmed up to my foster family and fur siblings including both a cat and a dog! As a matter of fact, I enjoy taking naps while snuggling with my humans and even have been fond of snuggling with my fur siblings, as well! I will still need slow introductions to other dogs, but quickly make friends once we get to know one another. I have met children while out and about and did well with them.\n\nI am a very smart young lady who is nearly fully house trained; going potty while leashed can be a challenge at times. I do think once I am fully house trained, I would not need to be crated while you are away as I have proven to be well behaved during my foster moms absence. I would much prefer a fenced in yard allowing me to run around and play freely while also using the restroom privately, but it is not necessary. I also would love to have a fur dog sibling of my very own in my forever home, but I believe I would also thrive just as well without one. I have moderate to low energy with some tricks up my sleeve such as knowing the commands, come and down and am working on sit and stay.\n\nI am quick to make friends with every human and cannot wait to find my perfect forever family!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the sweet, Princess Buttercup, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee is $250\nChildren must be 5 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older",

Bandit is house trained and crate trained. He is affectionate, intelligent, and knows basic commands. He sits and comes when called. He can be frightened of loud noises or loud voices. His foster parents have bathed him and cut his nails with no issue. Bandit has been great with visitors in his foster home. Bandit is leash trained and walks nicely on the leash, but he would really love a yard of his own where her can run and play. Bandit does need a good amount of exercise, but is also happy curled up in his dog bed or relaxing with his people! Bandit is not super food motivated and not a big eater. He shows no signs of food aggression. Bandit would love to be the only dog in the house where he could get all of the attention.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Bandit, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application. Don't forget to ask for BANDIT STEELE!!!!",

I started off as a homeless puppy in Arkansas before I made the long trek here to Anderson in search of a forever home.\n\nAfter a battle with parvo, I was adopted but unfortunately, it was not a perfect match. I was feeling a bit protective of my stuff and my new family was not prepared to teach me how to share. Hey, what can I say? I'm a full-figured guy committed to staying in shape (round is a shape right?) so obviously, food is going to be important to me. All I ask is that I get a quiet space with no interruptions to enjoy my meals and I'm sure we can be the very best of friends!\n\nI love other dogs, don't care much about cats, and think new human friends are the best! My perfect family will have the time to keep up with my continued training, offer me tons of enrichment, and all the love (and treats) I can handle! Since I am still working on my sharing an adult-only family or family with older kiddos would be best! \n\nIf you think that family sounds like yours then email my friends here at Anderson at info@andersonanimalshelter.org. I would love to meet you!",

To begin the process please fill out an application here:  http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\nThis is my foster dog...if you or anyone you know is interested in adopting this dog please contact: www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nName: \t\tGeorge \nGender: \tNeutered \nColor:\t\tBlack/White\nDOB:\t\t01/19/2014\nBreed:\t\tBorder Collie/Siberian Husky Mix\nWeight:\t70 lbs\nNotes:    Takes Benadryl for itchy skin.  \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog's age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon't forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com/DogGoneInn",

Let us introduce you to Tank, a dog whose extreme fluffiness can only be matched by his over the top personality! \nTank embodies all the good and the challenging aspects of a Great Pyrenees. He is loyal, intelligent, and watchful. He is impossibly affectionate (sometimes too much so) with the people he views as friends, but he is wary of strangers and takes a considerable amount of time and an appropriate approach to be comfortable with new people. Once you\u2019re in Tank's inner circle, you have a friend for life. However, it will take time, patience, and care to get there.\n\nTank has been a guest in our Behavior Program Manager\u2019s home for the last few weeks and she will be working directly with Tank\u2019s potential adopters to help them build a bond with Tank prior to his going home and will assist with the introduction process to his new environment. \n\nTank will need to be adopted into an adult-only, single-family home with a fenced yard and no other pets. \n\nIf you think you are ready for a plus-sized boy with a heart of gold and enough energy to power a city block then email: asalis@andersonanimalshelter to speak directly with our Behavior Program Manager and discuss the steps needed to make Tank your next best friend!",

She likes to play with toys, look out the window, follow you around and ask for pets. Her favorite playtime activity is playing fetch with her favorite ball. She loves squeaker toys and chewing on tough toys and bones. She may drag a shoe out to chew but once we tell her no she lets it be\n\n.\n\nShe doesn't mind being on a leash but is still learning leash manners. She may need some obedience training so she doesn't wrap the leash around you. She can get a little hyper but is just so excited to play and explore. She loves outside time! Cinder has a lot of energy, but can settle and give the best cuddles! We would recommend a home with a nice yard for her to play in and an adopter who will take her on a lot of walks!\n\nShe's making great progress with crate training and after a bit settles in and is quiet. She can sleep in her crate or out of her crate just fine. She is working on potty training and does well but does have some accidents, luckily she does know how to use a potty pad for the most part.\n\nUnknown with cats and has been reactive towards dogs lately, at first seemed interested but now barks so she may not be completely dog friendly. Slow intros, training and socializing will help. For the most part she is quiet but at times she can hear or see things outside and will bark for awhile, so an apartment or shared walls might not be best. She is not good with young children so she needs a home that does not and will not have kids living with her. She is an absolute sweetheart who just wants to be by you and be your best buddy!\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

            "description": "I'm Grommet, a sturdy 7-year-old Rattie mix who weighs 20 lbs. My foster mom says I'm a true gentleman. I love hearing that because when I first got here I was so confused. I had people that I loved, but they left me at a shelter because they said I bit their kid. You see, he kept bothering me when I was trying to rest. I tried telling him to stop. I gave him a look, then a growl, but he ignored my pleas, so I guess I must have put some teeth into my next request with a nip. And that was that!! I really want to be a good boy. My foster mom told me that I need people who 'know how to read dog signals' and 'can respect a dog's need to sleep without being bothered.' Now, that doesn't describe most kids, but I hope it describes you because I think you would like my gentlemanly manners. I use a dog door to do my business outside (and also to spend time sniffing around my fenced backyard). I share my toys with my fur siblings. I'm a good eater, and I sleep quietly through the night, either in my crate or in my humans' bed under the covers. I don't bark except to announce deliveries at the door. I know 'sit' and 'go find a toy,' and I'm ready to learn more. I don't need tons of exercise, but a little neighborhood walk is nice, as long as you let me do a lot of sniffing and not so much walking. Oh, and I really like belly rubs and taking naps in the sunshine. I'm Grommet and I want to belong again! Maybe we belong together, you and I? Check out more photos of me at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/grommet .\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

            "description": "Name: Spott\nAge: 4 years\nGender: Female\nBreed: Border Collie/Springer Spaniel\nWeight: 30 lbs.\nDog friendly: yes\nCat friendly: testing available upon request\nChild friendly: yes, respectful older school-aged children aged 8+ years, please\nHouse trained: yes\nCrate trained: yes\nEnergy level: low\nTemperament: timid, sweet\nRequirements: Not apartment appropriate, resident dogs must be similar in size or smaller and have a mild temperament\nAdoption Fee: $375+tax\n\nTo adopt, go to: www.mendingspirits.org/apply-to-adopt.html\n\nFrom the Foster Family: Have you ever wanted to be a HERO? Well, this is your chance! This sweet, lovely young lady needs a home where she can learn what it's like to be loved by humans. She has a sad story that can absolutely have a happy ending! Spott was brought to a rescue in Alabama when her owner died. She arrived with 3 other dogs, where they lived outside and had little to no human interaction. While in Alabama she was temporarily fostered in a home with two other resident dogs. She currently lives with two adults and four older, respectful children who understand her story and are working on gaining her trust. A few things about this beautiful pup. She is very timid, she finds comfort laying on doggie beds, the couch or in corners. She lets all of us pet her but she will shake a little until she gets comfortable. Once she's feeling good, she'll give you a tail wag and even a few kisses to show you that she's doing okay. She likes her belly rubbed and gentle petting on her head. Spott has never been on a leash. She was kept in a backyard where she was fed and that was about it. She is slowly learning how to go outside and do her business while on a leash. At first, we had to pick her up and carry her outside but now when she sees the leash she will make her way outside. She has made so much progress in just a few days! Her temp foster in Alabama had a fenced in the back yard and Spott would follow the resident dogs outside to do her business. She has started giving us a sign that she has to go out by whining just a little bit. A fenced-in backyard for Spott would be a plus. We generally leave her food out all day and she eats when she wants to. She typically won't eat when others are around but if you \"disappear\" for a little bit she will take care of eating her meal. She loves hot dogs and will eat those out of your hand if you're so kind enough to offer! We let her have free reign of the house and at night she sleeps wherever she is most comfortable. We just leave her be at night and she does great. Spott will require a family who will be patient with her and help build her trust with humans. With time, she will be the dog you've always dreamed of!\n\nAbout Me: Hi, my name is Spott and I'm so happy that my life is about to change! You, humans, are something new to me so I need you to be patient with me and help me learn to trust you. I've never had anyone pet me or walk me or show me affection. I know my foster family is trying to help me to trust and build confidence. You just have to understand that it will take some time. My foster family is very kind to me. I used to hide from them but they always found me and rubbed my belly or pet my head gently so now I trust them more and instead have a few favorite places where I'm most comfortable. I've stopped trying to hide! There are six humans in this house so I do get lots of attention! I'm starting to realize that I can wander around the house without being scared. I was so used to being outside 100% of the time so I'm learning about this thing dogs do, going outside to do their business and then going back into the house. Sometimes I think when they take me outside that they're going to leave me there but they always bring me back inside so that makes me happy! I'm learning to show them that I like affection by giving them occasional kisses and wagging my tail. It's just all so new to me. I have only been around kind humans for a few weeks but I am gaining confidence every day. My commitment to my furever family is that I will keep practicing to be a \"dog.\" Every day I gain more confidence so I know I can get there! I see myself going on long walks, and learning to snuggle with my humans once I know they are going to treat me with kindness. Will you please give me a chance?",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire.\n\nDue to COVID-19 precautions, all animals for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nJody, age 2, is an extremely affectionate Jindo dog, who loves being rubbed on her belly. Sitting in your lap is her favorite evening pastime. She is very smart, learning her potty business in 5 days! Retrieving her ball, and respectfully dropping it in front of you for more fun is one of her ways she communicates her happiness. And she is always communicating with her human.\nShe has had a rough start to her life, coming from S.Korea, but you would never know that from her sweet disposition. She has learned to not react to dogs, but she is not comfortable near them. We would trust her with older children, as long as they are kind and gentle. She is a very special pup! Jody will need a home with a fenced yard and not in an urban environment.\n\nJody is heartworm positive and undergoing treatment.\n\nLocation: Foster home\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\n We also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

At a robust almost 80lbs, Baby is a full-figured gal with plenty of warmth to share! Looking for a partner to get out and explore? Baby is already leashed and ready to go. Ready to curl up on the couch? Hope there's room (J/K, She'll make some!) cuz Baby is on her way for snuggles! She's an all-around good girl who is in need of a family that can provide open laps (oh yes, she thinks she is a lap dog) and plenty of love. Baby thinks other dogs are neat but does not like to share her food so if there is another pooch in the home Baby will need her space until her meal is done. We will do a meet and greet here at the shelter to make sure there is a canine connection before Baby goes home. \n\nIf one dog is all you're looking for, Baby would be just as happy to soak up all your love herself! \n\nTo learn more about Baby or to make an appointment to meet her gorgeous self in person, email info@andersonanimalshelter.org.\n",

When I arrived here, I was found to be heartworm positive and lucky for me, the nice people here decided to treat me. Don't worry though; I'm still available for adoption today!! I MUST return to our AHC for my scheduled appointments. I will have to be leash walked only and kept calm. I may be a little bit more work than some of the other dogs here, but I know I am worth it. Come visit me today and I'll show you why!!!",

If you're looking to shake those pesky pounds off and get yourself ready for summer then we have the best exercise partner for you! Cash is a boy on the go, go, go and he is looking for a high-energy person who can keep his busy brain and body enriched and happy! \n\nWhip-smart Cash is working on his basic manners here at Anderson and is ready to take his education to the next level so a commitment to positive reinforcement training is a must. Because this boy has ants in his pants a single-family home with a fenced-in yard would be a perfect fit but he will settle for regular walks, runs, and training instead, if his person can stay committed. \n\nCash is housetrained and is a power chewer who loves his nylabones.\n\nOther dogs might be okay if they don't mind Cash's rough and tumble style. A meet and greet at the shelter can ensure a good match! \n\nIf Cash sounds like the boy for you then email us at info@andersonanimalshelter.org to find out how to meet him!",

Filling his fit 70-pound frame with LOVE, he craves the companionship of his foster mom and wants nothing more than to cuddle with her on the couch and cover her in happy doggy kisses. He also loves when she pets his head and ears, showing his appreciation by resting his head on her thigh and even falling asleep on her hand! Very tolerant of her handling him and washing his ears and feet, he's also very fond of butt scratches, Nylabones and chew toys, any and all treats, including vegetables, and is learning to accept both food and treats more gently. Always eager to engage in play with his three large canine foster friends, he greatly enjoys going on walks around the neighborhood, and is at work on pulling less on his leash. Motivated by food and pets, he knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"crawl\", \"off\", is working on \"stay\" and on not stealing food. Housetrained, not a fan of felines, and in need of crate training, sweet and sassy Spike will thrive in a loving home with other dogs his own size and adopters to polish his manners, complete his training and keep him mentally and physically satisfied fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet,\n\nthe next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives!\n\nA home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $300. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nWe want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time.\n\nOur adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

We have a high-energy, unique boy for you! \n\nSweetie boy Chance was adopted as a puppy and unfortunately found himself back at the shelter after some unfortunate, aversive training decisions left him with anxiety that his adopters could not handle. Now that his anxiety is being managed and with positive reinforcement, we are seeing our sensitive boy shine! \n\nChance is working on relaxation exercises, basic manners, and meeting new people and is now ready for a family of his own. He does have some specific requirements he would like us to share. Chance would do best in an adult-only home or a home with older kids. A single-family home with a fenced-in yard would be ideal but a regular exercise and enrichment plan could make up for the lack of a yard. No other pets please! Chance wants to bask in all your undivided attention! \n\nFor more information or to set up an appointment to meet him please email us at info@andersonanimalshelter.org",

I'm thankful Alljoy4paws saw how scared and defensive I was at the shelter and knew I was really a good boy and wanted to save me from being killed off the euthanasia list. I proved them right although I needed some decompressing time with my foster who showed me how to trust again.  She says I'm very sweet but very stubborn so I'll need a husky savvy leader to show me the way cuz I love doing things my way but hey, what husky doesn't,  am I right? Haha! I'm a smart boy so it'll be fun to train each other and I really love my freedom so if you've got a big backyard,  I'll be in Heaven running all around but I definitely need a secure yard cuz even though I'll love you like crazy , we are escape artists. I've got a vibrant personality to go with my good looks but even though I'm thinking about lots of stuff,  I'm not very vocal. I do know the sit command and hand/paw command so we've got a little start in training. My foster thinks I'm best with older kids in the house. I have met other dogs and even a horse at the ranch, and I did very well, very friendly non-reactive to any of them. I will bond quickly and feel comfortable around you, I just want what every dog wants, a safe home with lots of love and fun adventures with my family! Are you ready to bring me home? I'm neutered,  vaccinated and chipped and ready for you to love!",

She is now a retired mommy just looking for a nice forever family to cuddle and play with her. She is the sweetest most gentle dog you will ever meet. When you talk to her, she never stops wagging her tail and has a big smile on her face. She doesn't mind the snow as this was something new for her. She likes playing around in the snow and going for walks. She also loves to chew a bone and play with plush squeaky toys. Her favorite thing to do is cuddle with you on the couch or bed, she absolutely loves to be pet. If you're looking low key dog that knows basic commands and is house trained she is your gal.\n\nAbout me:\nHello, my name is Pratt. The first few years of my life were spent mothering many puppies as I was a very good mommy. I am really excited to start a new life here up north and I am really liking the snow that is outside. It makes me get the zoomies for a bit, then I like to come inside cuddle up on the couch and take a nice nap. I was so excited to have all of these toys in my new foster family's house as I have never had any of my own. I enjoy playing with my new foster doggy friends and even share my toys with them. I really love it when people talk so sweet to me it makes me get a wiggle butt. I am only dreaming now of a home to call my own with a family I can relax, cuddle and play with. Will you make my dreams come true?",

I camt say enough good things about this big girl. She is an absolute doll. Gets along with everyone minds great on or off leash. Doesn't meet a stranger and she doesn't bark often as I've never heard her say a peep. Just an all around great dog! She is being spayed next week and will be 100% up to date and microchipped with lifetime membership. If you think Coco would be a good addition to your home and family please fill out the application then email me at Sgequinerescue@gmail.com because there will be more steps to complete for approval. Thank you for considering a rescue pet!",

My ID number is 336505\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Pepper! Looking for a very loyal, new friend? Pepper is learning to adjust to Shelter life! The living transition has been trying for him. Currently, Pepper is learning to be brave, trusting and confident. In his former home, Pepper was accustomed to his canine siblings and did well with them. Maybe you have a canine friend, that would accept Pepper as their sibling? This fella wants nothing more than to find a very special person and home, in which he can continue to learn and grow. He is certain to be a very loving and loyal new friend!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 335966 (male), and 336121 (female). Did well with both. Pepper is a very shy and timid boy. He is very submissive with other dogs, and humans too. He is very loving, but a slow approach is best with him. He will end up in your lap with gentle approach, and kindness 1/8/2020\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 50.8lbs Age: 1yrs 5mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

When we inquired about catching him and bringing him in, we were told he was vicious and mean. That could not be further from the truth. He\u2019s a shy, sweet and docile dude. It\u2019s heartbreaking the excuses people will make up to justify the abandonment/ mistreatment of an animal. \n\nBear is a beautiful and handsome man. He\u2019s crate and house trained and he does well on the leash! He\u2019s done well with other dogs and would really benefit from a dog that can show him the ropes. Cats are unknown. Bear is pretty scared of new people but he adores HIS people. He\u2019ll need a home that will continue his training when it comes to strangers. Other than that, he\u2019s basically perfect.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website: www.phillybullyteam.com",

            "description": "This sweet girl was seen running the area dragging a leash for about a week. No one could catch her though because she was scared and she was skin and bones. Finally she decided to take cover in a burned out house and a team of volunteers took advantage of that position and were able to rescue her. She was scared but very grateful to get into a warm car and have loving arms surround her. Now she is safe in rescue and is fat and happy. She is a great size at 50# and we think she is around 2 years old so she is out of that pesky puppy chewing stage yet plenty of fun to be had. She will happily go on walks or rides with you or sit beside you on the couch. She will guard her food with other dogs probably because she was starved but you just solve that by feeding your dogs separately if you have another dog. She hasn't met another person or animal she doesn't like. She will make a great addition to almost any family. If you are interested in adopting Christmas you can find the adoption application at funnyfarmrescueranch.org and read all about our TN based rescue and how this whole process works.",

His parents have some Chihuahua, Dachshund, Beagle, and Feist in them, but we are sure that there are plenty of other breeds in there too! He has the long legs of a chihuahua, an expressive face, and loves people!\n\nSven is sweet and loves treats. He grew up outside, but he is getting use to be inside an house. He is a little shy with strangers until he gets to meet them. Sven loves other dogs and would love a home with another dog to play with. He and his siblings were around outside cats and did fine with them, so we think that he would do well with a cat too.\nWe think that he will reach 20-30 pounds when full grown.\n\nSven will be available to go home with a new home this weekend after he is healed from his neuter.\n\nIf you are interested in him, please fill out an application at www.fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nDue to COVID-19, we are not able to facilitate meet and greets until a family is approved and then only at the foster family's discretion. At this time, we are not holding dog adoptions at Petsmart.\n\n**Applications can take anywhere from 5-7 business days to complete. When filling out an application, please scroll down after submitting it to be sure that the website accepted it and check for a confirmation email to be sure that your application went through. We respond by email, so please check your spam and trash folders.**\n\nWe are located in Fayette County, GA and are a foster based rescue without a shelter building.\n\n-Fayette Humane Society Dog Adoptions\n\nEstimated DOB: 07/28/2020\nAdoption fee: $300\n\nCLICK HERE to APPLY TO ADOPT\nor paste the following link in your browser: https://fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nFor full details about ADOPTING, please visit our Adoption Guide (https://fayettehumane.org/adoption-information/adoption-guide/).\n\nAll our dogs are tested for heartworms, spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.\n\nCats are tested for FLV/FIV when age appropriate, as kittens tested at an age less than 16 weeks tends to lead to unreliable results.

She never used the leg and to minimize arthritis and issues later on in life we opted to amputate. Millie is so much happier and playful without it! Millie gets along with everyone and is very sweet and calm. She is Hw+ and on slow kill Hw treatment and will go home with 6 months of Hw prevention to continue her treatment. Millie needs her forever. Her start in life wasn't so good but you could be her happily ever after! Please consider giving our sweet Millie her own home! Application will require a few more steps for approval so please fill it out and email is at Sgequinerescue@gmail.com to get the process started!",

Her parents have some Chihuahua, Dachshund, Beagle, and Feist in them, but we are sure that there are plenty of other breeds in there too!\n\nElsa spent most of her life with other dogs, so she needs a home where another dog can help to show her the ropes. She adores playing and following other dogs around. She is very sweet and loves to sit and cuddle on the couch with her people. However, Elsa will need a patient and experienced family who can help her come over some fears that she has- she is scared of people standing up and is scared of walking in a leash. We know that with time and training, she can learn to be fine with both things, but for now a home without younger kids and with a yard with at least a 4ft. fence would be best for her.\n\nElsa grew up outside, but she is getting use to be inside a house. She and her siblings were around outside cats and did fine with them, so we think that she would do well with a cat too.\n\nWe think that she will reach 20-30 pounds when full grown.\n\nIf you are interested in him, please fill out an application at\nwww.fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nDue to COVID-19, we are not able to facilitate meet and greets until a family is approved and then only at the foster family's discretion.

Thank You! \n\nIt\u2019s time to accept applications for puppy adoptions! We expect to get more amazing apps than we have puppies to go around. The adoption team will begin screening applications based on the order they were received.  Once screened and ready to continue on with the approval, someone will reach out to you in order to move on to the next step.\n\nOnce we have enough approved applications, we will set up a time for you to FaceTime with the foster mom to pick your puppy. This will happen by order of approval, so please don\u2019t apply for a specific puppy based on their photos. We cannot guarantee that puppy will be available. If any of the (we will have 4 or 5 pups available) approved adopters change their mind, we will refer back to the applications we have on file.\n\nDue to covid concerns you will not be permitted to visit your puppy prior to adoption day. We will set up appointments to finalize the adoptions and take home your new baby once we know their date of surgery. You must be able to travel to the Girard, Ohio area. \n\nBe detailed in your answers on your application and follow the instructions on our website. Please be advised that if your screen turns gray it means you did not complete the application and it will not be delivered.  Scroll through the gray screen. It will tell you exactly which section(s) you left blank and allow you to fix it.  This is your opportunity to describe what type of home you can provide. We will be looking for homes that are prepared for a puppy and have veterinary and training resources lined up. \n\nHome ownership is required and we do call your vet to verify resident dogs are current on all core vaccines and flea, tick and heartworm prevention, as well all of your pets must be altered.\n\nPlease be patient. Please be kind.  We want the best possible homes for these babies and that will take time to go through all of the applications and will require some hard decisions.\n\nThis process will take weeks as we won\u2019t finalize their adoptions until they are at LEAST 8 weeks old.\n\nhttps://www.apaprescue.com/pre-adoption-application\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTe adoption donation for a puppy is $250.  Submitting an application does not guarantee approval of application or adoption of any puppy.\n",

He is learning basic commands quickly, he's nearly housebroken, and it only took a few days to learn that he gets lots more treats if he keeps all four paws on the floor. This hunk is going to be a breeze to train!\n\nBronco came to HFE as a Christmas puppy that got too big, too fast. This lovable dude comes in at over 25 pounds at only 13 weeks old. He could be a big guy when he is full grown! He loves to play tug, chase a flirt pole, and chew on benebones. It is important that his forever family is active so that he can continue to use his energy in a positive way. He could make an excellent running partner or frisbee fan. \n\nBronco lives in a home with lots of siblings-he is enjoying his dog brother and sisters, as well as his 8 year old human foster brother. He would love a home with kids of his own, but even a home without human kids would be fine, as long as he has a playful dog sister to bond with. \n\nThis guy is truly one of a kind. He is going to make a lucky family very happy!\n\nBronco's new home MUST be one with a physically fenced yard. Homes with no fence or with electronic fences will not be considered. No exceptions. Please do not inquire or apply for Bronco if you do not have a physically fenced yard. Your inquiries will not be considered.\n\nWe do not adopt out of the country, out of the state, or more than an hour outside of Metro-Detroit.",

Like most setters, she needs to sniff everything, but she\u2019s been easily dissuaded from jumping up to pull morsels off of the countertop.  Eager to please and very intelligent, Izzy takes direction and redirection nicely and is quickly learning voice commands. She does well with other dogs and is suited to be with children.  She is currently jumping up for joy when she sees new humans, but is quickly learning that it\u2019s not polite!  Izzy really loves being with her people, so she would do well in a house where someone is home for most or all of the day.  She settles into her crate when her foster family is ready for bed.  During the day, she prefers to lay at the feet of someone whose Zoom calls and keyboard strokes can gently lull her to sleep.  She just melts when you pet her and gives the sweetest hugs.  \n\nIzzy needs a family who will be diligent about training her and getting her outside to play.  \n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "We are no longer accepting applications for Toby\n\nAnimal Profile: Toby is a 5-year-old medium mixed breed (such a soft coat!) who is a great size at 35 lbs. He can be a little shy around new people, but he's very sweet and gentle once he warms up to you. Toby is crate trained and house trained, and is learning things like sit, stay, place, crate, and more in his Seattle-area foster home. His leash manners are improving and he's a great running partner, but he needs work on his leash reactivity around other dogs and small furries. Toby will benefit from slow introductions to other dogs, and does best with dogs that are bigger than he is. Once he's comfortable with other dogs, hanging out with them helps him become more confident. Toby does have some prey drive, so a home without cats or other small pets is needed. We are only considering single family residence's for Toby at this time. This sweet pup is ready for his forever home, where he can explore the world in good company and have a loving family to cuddle up with. We'll post more information about him as we get to know him better.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $475, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California, fostered and adopted in 2018. Returned in 2021 due to divorce and is now in a Seattle-area foster home. He will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated.",

I am crate and house trained and although I do like to jump, I obey basic commands like sit and stay. I'm very laid back and quiet but because I'm very strong it would be best if my human siblings are at least six years old. In my foster home I have a sister who is 110 pounds but I also have 2 sisters that are 10 pounds so I get along well with dogs of all sizes. I've been introduced to kittens and I have a sense of curiosity but show no aggression. I enjoy playing hard but then I take a long nap to reenergize. I forgot to mention that I love to sit on laps and cuddle too. My foster mom says I'm very easy to love. If you think I would fit into your home, please fill out an application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PAPS/Dog or petsearchpa.org.",

I'm a bit more outgoing than my brother and have a very deep bark that I let out when I greet the humans and passerby doggos. I keep a pretty tidy kennel, leading the humans to believe that I'm housebroken...but toys...beware! We are very sweet boys and will make someone awesome companions!

She is not only beautiful, she is also sweet! Sarah loves to play and walks well on a leash. She is looking for a family or best friend with whom to share her life!\n\nSarah was found in a rural area by an animal control officer. She is receiving the best care here, but she would rather a home of her own. She tested negative for heart worms and is receiving monthly parasite preventatives. She is also fully vaccinated and will be spayed prior to adoption. Please call us at 580-252-7387 or send us a Facebook message, if you would like to meet Sarah!For more information, please email Stephens County Humane Society at schs@att.net, or call us at 580-252-7387 (PETS). Our animals are spayed/neutered, UTD on shots, and treated for ticks, & fleas. Cats are tested for FeLV & FIV; and dogs are tested for heart worms.\n\nNormal adoption fee for cats is $75.00; and $100.00 for dogs, but we frequently have specials running and/or animals who have had their adoption fee sponsored, so ... call us!

            "description": "Breed: Treeing Walker Coonhound\nSex: Male\nDOB: ~01/22/2017\nWeight: 40 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Happy-Go-Lucky, Social, Playful, Goofy, Talkative\nHistory: Transferred from another shelter\nGood With: Dogs, Kids\nIdeal Home: Active home. No apartments.\nFence Requirements: Required\nSpecial Info: Adopter must do research on this breed to ensure good fit!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

I am ready to find my furever home with some preferably active hoomans. I have LOTS OF ENERGY and would love to go on walks and runs and hikes and adventures. Can you come with me? Or can I come with you? As you can tell, I like treats, exploring, adventuring, toys, and a lot more. Did I say treats? I will DO ANYTHING for a treat. I really, really, really love food so a home without young kids would be best for me.\n\nI still need to be tested with other dogs. Also, please don't have a cat.. I think they're fun to chase, I haven't caught one yet.. but it's probably best if I'm in a house without one!All cats and dogs adopted from the Chequamegon Humane Association are spayed or neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, and microchipped. Dogs are tested for heartworm and cats are tested for FeLV/FIV (results negative unless otherwise noted). A tax-deductible adoption fee of $150 is required for adult dogs, puppies are $200, and dogs over the age of 10 are $85. Adult cat adoption fees are $50, kittens under one year are $90, and cats over the age of 10 are $35.",
