She was adopted from a Chicago-area shelter at 5 years old, and was surrendered to rescue at nearly 10 years old when she wasn\u2019t happy about the new baby in her family. In the meantime, she was diagnosed with a heart issue which requires that is well controlled with an easy daily pill.\n\nCharlie gets along with other dogs around her size, is great with both men and women (but seems to prefer men!) and very devoted to her people. She is low key, but loves to go for walks, and would actually do fine being leash walked daily for her potty time. She really wants nothing more than a comfy dog bed and some attention.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting our adorable Charlie, please visit our website at www.IgRescueOhio.org to submit an adoption application.",

Gilley melts when she is hugged and petted, and she goes absolutely bonkers for toys. She's an active dog, so a fenced yard and / or regular walks or jogging would be ideal. Gilley was originally a bit over-eager and/or tentative around the other dogs here, but has been doing much better lately. We still don't leave her unattended with other dogs, but she could probably go to a home with another dog if supervised. She would also be fine as the only pet. Since we don't have children in our homes, we also don't know how she would be around them. Gilley is crate-trained and appears to be house trained. We think she could easily learn commands if someone works with her. Apply online at our website or email us for more information.",

            "description": "Hi everyone, I'm Piper! I long for love and acceptance out of life. Can you give me that? I was the runt of my litter (our mom was pure Doberman, dad unknown), and I suffered from parvo as a baby. I still have lingering side effects, which lead me to having poor coordination. My vet says my front half doesn't know what my back half is doing. I do well in areas I am accustomed to that have few hurdles for me. I like to go for walks and play. Here at the shelter, though, I bump my head a lot in small spaces (they say they are gonna get me a Bears helmet to wear, haha). I also tend to slip a lot on the floors. When we have bad weather at the shelter, I have trouble navigating the stairs into the play yards, so I tend to get knicked up sometimes. A shelter really isn't the place for a girl like me. In a home, one would barely notice any deficiencies! I would be just like a regular pup! I excel at nose work (I can find a cookie in any cardboard box!) and alerting my family to any potential danger. Squirrels are deadlier than they appear... I have a buddy at the shelter who spends lots of time with me and this is what she says: \"I have been Piper's buddy for a few months now and I so hope she will find a foster home during the construction of our new shelter. I am unable to foster her myself due to the fact that my grandchildren of four, five and under, spend time at my home and it would be the same as the construction zone for Piper. My dream home for her would be on a quiet street with a front porch where she can sit with her family and continue to see that the outside world is not something to fear. What she really needs more than the dream front porch is a quiet home with a fenced back yard and baby gates for the stairs in the home, so she won't fall. She needs a family who will help her to become the confident dog that I know she has the potential to be in the future. She is so sweet and really has come a long way in the time I have spent with her. She bonded with me quickly and has begun to be less fearful out in front of the shelter. She has even gotten stronger and her gait is much steadier. I hope that someone can help this special girl.\" It is important to note that on the occasion I take vacations at volunteers' home, I am not known to have accidents if I get taken out regularly. I need work on basic obedience commands. Going to classes will help me with my confidence, socialization and bond with my new family. I have not been well socialized with other dogs, so I am not sure what to make of them. I am respectful and am in some puppy play groups at the shelter to help me in this regard. Since I was known to be possessive over food and toys in my old home, unfortunately, I must be the only pet. I can be a bit of a scaredy cat, and loud noises send me for under the bed, so if I am to live with kids they must be at least 12. Since I am uncoordinated, I cannot live where I would have to go up and down the stairs. I want to live a full, happy life with you. Won't you take a chance on a very special girl like me?\n\nPlease note - we always take our animals back if for some reason it doesn't work in your home so we only adopt to the following Illinois counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will.",

She is also not an \"easy\" dog. She's not a couch potato, though she will relax with you and she does love to snuggle. She loves all humans, adults and kids alike. She needs someone who will continue all her training that she has worked so hard on the last few years, so that she does not revert back into being leash reactive.\n\nShe needs someone who will get her sufficient exercise, understand how to properly channel her drive and take her intensity seriously. She needs a fully fenced yard that is fenced with stockade six foot fencing so there is no chance of another dog getting in or her getting out. If you can understand how to own a dog like Eve, you will have a serious GEM on your hands who will love your kids unconditionally and be a joy to have in your home.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT INQUIRE ABOUT EVE IF:\n-You have ANY other pets\n-You are against crates\n-You are not open to balanced training\n-You live in an apartment complex where there are other dogs\n\nEmail\u00a0caredogvolunteers@gmail.com\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: All dogs are in foster care all over MA & RI. They are NOT at the cat shelter in Acushnet, which is the address listed on Petfinder. There are ONLY cats there. We do not set up meet and greets with dogs until after you've been approved to adopt. Please do not email asking us if you can come by and meet a dog the same day.*",

He has a history of seizures and takes medication twice a day (cost per month @$45)\n\nWith the Covid-19 situation, FURS has temporarily stopped our weekly adoption stands.  We can make alternate arrangements for meeting the FURS dogs but would require an approved application for adoption.  There is no fee or obligation with submitting an adoption application and applications can be completed on line at www.fursdogs.com\n\nA required step of our adoption process is to conduct a home visit.

Playful, exuberant and downright giddy when playtime comes around, Marshmallow loves getting out to the yard and snuggling up with his people when they're not playing. There's nothing we love to see more than Marshmallow's smile as he has had a long journey to get to us.\n\nWe first met Marshmallow when he was found running along a local road in pretty strange circumstances. He had a muzzle on that was too tight, and another collar. Having no idea what had happened to Marshmallow before he ended up near our shelter, we set out to make sure he knew from that day forward he was going to be loved and cared for. Given how we had met him, it made sense that Marshmallow needs more time to get to know new people. Once he has settled in a new place, he is wary of strangers and needs more time to get to know someone. A potential adopter would come by the shelter a few times to get to know him and our Shelter and Behavior Manager would be able to explain in-depth how to transition Marshmallow into a home. Once he has opened up,\u00a0he is an absolute gem of a dog. Marshmallow is smart, loving and affectionate all wrapped in a cute package.\u00a0\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/pnkaGTG8Cy4dgQRJ8\nCharacteristics",

Tonight she sat when asked, is learning the valuable \u201ctouch\u201d command, working on leave it. She also can participate in group without reacting to other dogs! She still should be an only dog in her adoptive home. With continued training I can\u2019t wait to see what else this love bug can do!\n\n(Update - 11/6/18) Winnie is part of the \u201cI\u2019m a good dog program\u201d.\nWinnie is a people-pleaser, but very dog selective so her and her foster are involved with the training program that Tails Of Hope does with Haley Howes Sound Hounds.  With Winnie's adoption you will receive 3 free group classes to help transfer the skills that Winnie has learned.\n\n(Update - 10/24/18) Winnie is a 6yo Boxer mix, weighing 50lbs. It would be best for Winnie to be an only dog.\n\nYou can like us on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/tailsofhopeohio and you can fill out an application at http://www.tailsofhope.us/\n\nPlease fill out an application if you're interested! The adoption fee is $165 for adults and $190 for puppies. As with all of our dogs, we do our best to determine breed and size when grown using vet and shelter input, but we can not guarantee breed, size or weight when grown.",

            "description": "Riley was rescued during Hurricane Michael, in the Florida Panhandle. Riley's family lost their home and unfortunately had no where to go that would accept dogs. He was very bonded to his brother, but may not due well with new dogs. We are unsure of his background as we had very limited time with his prior owners. We believe Riley is still recovering from the shock of the hurricane, as he was inside the home as the walls collapsed. He does well indoors, is house broken and seems to be getting use to a new life here at Oscar's Cause. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Riley and you have other pets, we highly recommend bringing them in for a proper introduction prior to adoption. It is unknown how Riley is with cats, as we have not tested that. Riley would do best with an experienced owner, someone with history with dogs whom have been through a lot of stress.",

She is a very frightened girl who is good with other dogs and is learning to accept the love of people. Josie is currently in a home receiving lots of love and support from her fosters and several other canines. She loves to romp with her new foster siblings in the safety of their fenced backyard. That being said, the perfect home for her would be one with a fenced yard, other dogs and older children (if any) as she is nervous around sudden movements and noises.  Josie has been spayed, fully vaccinated and is heartworm positive. Not to worry though, SQ Rescue has started her treatment and will cover that expense. Please consider taking Josie in as your new family member. \n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you are interested in this wonderful pet, please complete an online application at sqrescueinc.org. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs outside of our scheduled adoption events. For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

I am two years old and love to be with my people. I will need a couch to snuggle on when we nap the day away! I also love to tag along when going for a ride in the car! I am the perfect size at 60lbs and am a pitty mix! I am looking for a home without cats (I am pretty sure they are the real villians). I would be happy as your one and only pup or with some canine siblings as long as there are no toys around.  I take those too seriously.  I would enjoy living with some older kids!  I am a smart guy and have already passed the house and crate training tests! I am ready to redem the name Bain and show you, we all aren't villians. Fill out an application and let the cuddle games begin! \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

This handsome boy is pure white and oh, so beautiful! Q-tip or just 'Q' is a very sweet older boy. \n\nQ-tip just wants to lay on your lap in a blanket and be loved. What a sweet and beautiful boy! If you need to go out, Q-tip will lay on the back of the couch and look out the window waiting for your return - so be sure to leave the blinds up a bit for him to see outside.\n\nQ-tip will love his person unconditionally, but he needs time to realize you are his person. You see, this boy came to Mostly Muttz Rescue from a situation of neglect. He needs time and consistency for him to thrive. He has been getting lots of love and structure from his foster family. \n\nQ is crate trained. He might whine the first few minutes but will settle after that. He is great on a leash. While walking, fast cars or trucks might startle and scare him, but he is making progress with that.\n\nIs time, love, and stucture something you can give this boy? Do you have room in your home and heart for this special boy? You can apply to adopt Q-Tip at www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

She is an affectionate 8 years young Boxer mix, and is approximately 60 pounds.\n\nShe rides well in the car, is housebroken, and crate trained. Pepsi is very shy around new people so she would need to be introduced slowly to anyone she doesnt know, but once she knows you Pepsi will reward you with kisses!\n\nPepsi likes to be outside, loves to go swimming, and is a champion fetch player! Still, at 8 years young she is a very active girl. In her downtime, Pepsi is great in the house. She is an awesome couch snuggler and would be the perfect companion while you binge-watch your favorite tv shows.\n\nPepsi is a super smart girl that learns very quickly. Get a treat out or a squeaky toy and she's ready to go! She would love to find a home that loves a routine because she is best when she sticks to one.\n\nIf you are interested in adding Pepsi to your family fill out an application at www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

He has limited vision,,, but that doesn't stop him from being out and about with everyone else,,,, he manages the deck steps and finds the doggie door as quickly as anyone else. He's fine with the other small dogs and not at all demanding of attention.\nWith a family of his own and less sibling competition he might find that more human attention is pretty great. But he doesn't seem very keen on change, so we're not going to make him go thru the trauma of relocation unless something real special comes along!!\nHe's neutered, updated on shots and microchipped. This fella is kind of super sized as Pekes go,,,,, but that just gives you more to love!\nIf you're looking for a pretty quiet laid back pooch for your family, Peanut might be your guy\n12/15/20 1:38 PM",

He is dog selective and becomes reactive when he encounters a dog larger than himself when leash walking and while off leash at the dog park. Ike is treat and food aggressive but his foster family works with him on this issue, and his is slowly improving. He does pull on the leash and he also jumps on people; professional training may be of a benefit. Ike does shed a whole lot, and the foster does mean a LOT - so those with allergy issues that are interested in Ike would certainly need to spend some time with him to judge the possibility of an allergic reaction. As Ike has a high energy level, along with jumping up onto people and the leash tugging, we don't recommend placement in a home with toddlers and/or small children. Cats are a no go as Ike loves to chase them!!!",

Noah is a little shorty, but he has no issues with that. He's always in a good mood, he loves life and he loves to give kisses. Noah is super entertaining, he will make you smile all day. Noah is currently receiving professional obedience training and is up for any adventure. Noah is all that once he knows you, but he is not good with strangers, therefore he will need an adult home (no children) with a yard (no apartment/condo situations) and someone to love! He's wonderfully behaved in the home and super silly. \nThank you for your interest in adopting/fostering. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio. This dog is not looking for a foster home, but rather a forever home. \nContact us today to meet this sweetie!\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030 \npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application:\nhttp://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

He was found out in the cold, emaciated.  He is now healthy and ready for his forever home.  \n\nOscar loves to play with toys and he loves people!  He loves going on walks and getting to say hi to everyone he passes.   He'd do well with older kids but not as well with small children since he's large and we wouldn't want him to knock them down accidentally.  \n\nOscar would like a home where he has an active family to occupy him and a backyard with a stockade fence.  He is such a sweet boy who just needs someone to give him a chance at a life with love and a family.  He would do best as the only dog in the home. \n\nOscar is leash and crate trained.  He has probably never lived in a home before so most likely he will need assistance with house training although he does keep his kennel clean. \n\nOscar is neutered, microchipped, and up-to-date on his shots.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Oscar and make him a part of your family, please apply at FYDRadopt.com\n\nOscar is also in need of a foster home!  If you'd like to foster him, please apply at https://foreveryoursokc.org/foster-application/",

Keira was found living in a hoarding situation which was not good for her health but despite this she is incredibly kind and sweet with all people and other dogs.  \n\nKeira loves to snuggle with her people and she loves to play with other dogs.  She is a very sweet dog who is very friendly and outgoing.  She wants to be with her people as much as possible.  \n\nKeira would like a home where she has another dog friend to play with and lots of love.  She also loves to go on walks so would love an active family who would take her on a daily walk. She needs a patient family who will work with her on her training but will love her for the amazingly sweet dog she is.  She would also love a home with a securely fenced yard as she loves to play outside. \n\nKeira is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Keira and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

She has been in a home for a while since and is just the nicest dog.  \n\nDolly loves her person.  She is extremely affectionate and loving.  She loves to play with toys and chase balls.  She also loves her chew toys.  She is loyal to her owner and protective.  Dolly has done well with all the adult people she's met but she is nervous so I wouldn't put her in a home with children as they are more loud and energetic than she would like.   She has been fine with the dogs she's met.  \n\nDolly can be a little shy and timid at first.  She enjoys a nice quiet lifestyle and loves sunbathing in her yard.  Dolly would like a home where she can be a couch potato but also get to go out and about.  She is just a lover and looking for someone who to hang out with and give lots of love and affection to.   She would love to have a fenced yard in her forever home.  \n\nDolly is crate, leash, and house trained. \n\nDolly is spayed, microchipped, and up-to-date on her shots.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Dolly and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 7/8/18\nReason for being in rescue: Stray, found at CPR employee's house\n\nFoster location: Foster Home in Pacolet, SC\nSpecial Needs? This dog was lightly heartworm positive when he came in. We had him on a monthly preventative and is now heartworm free!!!\nWeight: Estimated 52 lbs\nHeight: est 24\" at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes, Dawson is a young, large breed dog and needs room to play. He also needs the security of a fence that he can not escape. Dawson likes to go on walk about all by himself and has to be watched. Dawson can open gates with his nose. You have to stay with him in the yard and your gates must have clips on them to keep this smart guy from taking himself out of the yard. He does not climb or dig out of his own yard. He is in a a 5' high farm fence and this happily contains him.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Dawson has a puppy personality and needs basic training. He would do best in a home with no small animals. He is living with two toy poodles and doing well but his foster mom is very dog savvy and knows how to keep his energy channeled in the right direction. He would love a larger dog to play with. Oreo S'moreo, also up for adoption, is his BFF in the play yards. Dawson is used to a lot of human interaction and needs someone who is not going to leave him in a crate more than 2 hours at a time. He gets bored easily and he will figure out how to escape. A best case scenario would a home school family with children over 8 years old or a recent retiree who is looking for a best buddy and has lots of time to spend.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Dawson is believed to be a Shepherd/Husky mix and is only estimated to be around 1 year old. Dawson is a happy go lucky guy always looking for someone to give hugs to. He doesn't think twice about sticking his paw up for hand shakes or jumping on you for nose kisses. He is problem solving smart, and all that intelligence needs to be coached and directed. He needs a job and he will thrive. He's not a couch potato kind of guy.\n\nDawson has a very high energy level. His foster mom's fondest wish for him is someone retired from police work or military work with canines and that has had much dog training experience and wants to keep their skills sharp. Dawson would absolutely thrive with someone who wanted to try many of the canine activities available today. His foster mom thinks he would thrive at nosework. She also thinks he would enjoy lure coursing and barn hunting and maybe even weight pulling.\n\nHe has a strong prey drive and a nose that knows all. He could also do great with a fun, active family to play with or with an outdoors kind of person who runs, hikes, and camps. We could see Dawson hiking the Appalachian Trail and being Mr. Adventure (but always on leash). So far he has gotten along with the dogs that he has came into contact with, but is too rough and curious for very small animals. He walks well on a leash using a front lead harness. With a regular harness he would pull. He loves to ride in a car and never gets car sick. He is used to travelling in a seat belt harness. We know this guy will move his way into a families heart very quickly, given the chance!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? He loves strangers, he loves them so much he even walked up and introduced himself to our groomer when he was a stray. That got him a foster home.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 7/8/2017. Dawson is in a foster home with our groomer. She is teaching him the joys of sleeping in the bed, riding in the car and going to Petco to shop. He has learned sit, shake and down. He is reacting very well to all this teaching and mastering his new skills. Dawson comes to the farm each day that his foster mom works to socialize with other dogs and romp and play in our fields. He is getting a well rounded education on how to be a great pet.\n\nDawson would be destructive if left unsupervised in the house. Destructive fun includes getting into the trash, he stares hard at the guinea pigs that he can't reach. He will counter surf. Latest theft was a bag of taco shells when his foster mom was grocery shopping. He needs a strong crate to hold him. He's happy in a plastic heavy duty vari kennel with a chewy while you are out grocery shopping or otherwise engaged.\n\nHouse trained? Dawson is in a foster home and he has never had an accident in the house. He is supervised at all times when he is in the house. His foster mom says he does not offer to life his leg and mark ever. He sleeps sounding but if his family gets up to go potty in the middle of the night, he's a good boy and goes outside, too. Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

She is a sight-hound mix and has all the wonderful attributes that they possess.  If you would like a dog that can run like the wind then she is the dog for you!  An ancient breed, they were the hunting dogs and Brooke certainly thinks she should be queen!\n\nThis speed and the unusual ability to see far into the distance necessitates a fenced in yard or a place that is fenced where she can stretch those long legs of hers!  She walks well on leash but likes to be able to feel the wind in her fur.\n\nWe have asked Brooke what she would like in her very own home and she feels she would like an adult home who have dog experience.   She also requests that she be the only animal in the home!   The fenced in yard is a plus, lots of toys to enjoy and destuff, her very own bed, and people who love her sensitive side!\n\nTo learn more about this absolutely gorgeous gal, call Our Companions Animal Rescue at 242-9999 or e-mail daryl@ourcompanions.org\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All of the pets promoted by Our Companions Animal Rescue are located in CT.  As such we wish to adopt animals into homes in the greater CT area.  Pets are in various locations so we request that an appointment is made to meet with a specific pet we are advertising.

            "description": "Pupdate: Recently we learned Gizmo's tail was blocking her bowels. The recommendation was to remove the tail and hope for normal bowel function. Her tail was removed July 29, 2020 and she is all healed up on the outside. The goal now is for her to have predictable, easy to clean bowel movements, but, without her tail in the way, she can now wear toddler diapers if she needs to go somewhere. We know she is improving because she keeps herself pretty clean, whereas last year, she didn't even know she had a backside!\n\nPupdate: Gizmo has been to several follow up appointments with her neurologist and has made progress each time. In January 2020, she saw the heart specialist again. She still has a class 3 murmur but is continuing to do well.\n\nUpdate: Gizmo continues to improve and we hope someday soon, she will have control over her potty habits. Until then, we wait and pray and hope.\n\nUpdate - Gizmo's post op check up ad staples removal went well. She seems like she is improving and can't wait to be active again.\n\nUpdate: Gizmo has surgery on 7/24/19 to correct her tethered spinal cord and close the hole in her spinal column. During her pre-examination the vets found she now has a class 3 heart murmur caused by a malformation and leaflet tethering in her left ventricle. Gizmo is just a year old! He wants to start her on heart medication and monitor her every 6 months to see if any symptoms present. We have a post-op foster for her & she will be on 6 weeks crate rest and then have several check ups with the surgeons at VCA & then we really hope and pray she finds a forever home! We also hope and pray the surgery accomplished the goal of giving her control of her back end. Prayers for tail wags and normalacy!\n\nUpdate: Gizmo had an MRI on Dec 5, 2018. She has a hole in her spinal column which has allowed her spinal cord to attch itself to muscle outside the spinal column. The good news is she can probably have surgery and be healed. The bad news is we are in the red for $2500 on her medical expenses so far and surgery could run another $4500 or more.\n\nWe were asked to help her when her mom's family couldn't. Her tail doesn't move and her back legs are weak. We paid a vet visit to get a referral to the neurologist in a nearby city and she saw the specialist twice. Gizmo could be adopted by a family who understands her needs and will get her to her appointments as needed. She is crate trained and a happy girl who walks well on a leash. She gets along with other dogs of all sizes and hasn't seemed interested in cats. She adores people and is very loving at all times. We know there is a special family out there for this special girl.\nWe work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.\n2/2/21 3:50 PM",

She is very energetic and playful, loves her toys, hikes, and car rides and is a lot of fun for the right person!

She is a quirky little girl looking for an adult home with someone who understands her and many people coming and going where she can be introduced slowly to new people. She gets along with some dogs and we can arrange for her to meet your other dogs to see if they would be a fit. Please submit an application from www.rbari.org to meet her.

No one ever claimed them from animal control.  These two female Lab/Shepherds have no background information and their past is a mystery.  Luna is the yellow one and her age is estimated to be about 2 1/2 years old.  Star is the black and tan one and is thought to be a little older at 4 years old.  Both of them weigh just over 60 pounds.  Luna is more outgoing with people and can be quite playful with people once she knows them.  Star takes more time to warm up to a person and new surroundings, but she can also be playful, especially with Luna.  Both girls keep their kennels clean and they enjoy toys, treats, and playing outside in our fenced area.  Luna is learning to be on a leash, but Star still just refuses to move. For this reason, a fenced yard is needed for Star to go out into for potty time. Star is very dependent on Luna and will follow her.  The girls need to be adopted together!  These two are both spayed, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and ready to move on!  All they need is a very patient owner that can continue their socialization.",

She had a very badly broken leg and eye sight loss with head trauma. Momma Jodi had been abandoned by her owner and, soon after, was hit by a car out on a busy rural road. Calm, laidback, and quiet, Jodi loves everything there is in life - including people - and she is very friendly to everyone she meets without being pushy or ill-mannered. She will need verbalizarion when approaching her due tonight loss.\n\nThis Rescue tracked back to breeder and found out Jodi was trained as a rig dog for hog hunting. She has lost that ability due to her injuries.  Momma Jodi is a perfectly behaved, gentle and loving lady and she even knows some commands. She gets along great with adults, children, and other dogs. Jodi is housebroken, crate-trained, up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.\n\nJodi is ready for a calm and laid back home.  Will she work well in yours?",

We are volunteer based and will do our best to get back to you within 72 hours.  Please do not call as our phone is intended for emergencies only. If we feel that one of our dogs is a good match we will set up a private meet and greet  We do not have a physical location where you can come and meet all the dogs at once, so meet and greets may take a little time to coordinate.

I have some separation anxiety and ended up being just a little too much for my adopters. As such, I would do best in a home with someone who isn\u2019t gone very often.\n?\nI\u2019m really a sweet girl who just wants to love and be loved. I especially like hanging out with kids, and babies don\u2019t bother me at all. I also get along well with little dogs and cats. I have basic obedience and would love to spend time with you while you teach me more tricks and commands!\n?\nIf you think you might be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nKenzi is an affectionate girl who loves everyone. She has great confidence, allowing her to handle any situation with aplomb. She does have some separation anxiety, so she would do best with a family that is either home most of the time or takes her with them. She is still very active and loves to run and play. One of her favorite pastimes is chewing on sticks or tree stumps.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Kenzi, please visit tirrrescue.org/kenzi.",

I\u2019ve been at TIRR Rescue since 2016.\n?\nI was transferred to TIRR from a shelter in the hopes TIRR could help me find a home that could keep me. You see, I\u2019m a bit of an escape artist. I know how to jump and climb fences, so I\u2019ll need someone who will be willing to always supervise me outside or to escape-proof their fence.\n \nI get along well with just about anyone, though I love my girls Nellie and Buda. I\u2019m a pretty cool dog, so I do well in just about any situation. I am super playful and active, though, so I\u2019ll do best in a home where my people are always active or with another dog. I absolutely love meeting new people, so you should come check me out!",

My name is Buda - short for Boudica - and I've been at TIRR Rescue since 2013.\n\nWhen I was young, a nice man saved me from the shelter and brought me to TIRR Rescue in the hopes they could find me a great forever home.  I haven't found one yet, but I'm still hopeful!\n\nI'm good with other big dogs and like to wrestle, especially with my pal Poncho.  I absolutely love my people and am always excited to see them.  I can be pretty active, but I also enjoy just laying around in my dog house - or under it - keeping cool.  I would make a great jogging or walking buddy; it would help me burn off some of my excess energy.  I really like to dig, as you can see in one of the pictures above, so it would be really nice if I could have a yard with a dedicated digging space for me!\n\nI'd love to meet some new people, so you should definitely come see me.  If you think you could be next forever home, be sure to talk to my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nBuda is a sweet girl.  She loves to play and wrestle but also loves to lay around and chill, preferably with a soft, stuffed toy.  While she does well with most dogs, she sometimes gets annoyed with little dogs and is best not left unsupervised with them.  She loves her people and is always excited to see them.  She would make a good walking partner, but she will also need a dedicated digging area so she can pass time doing one of her favorite activities without ruining the yard.  However, Buda really just wants a family that will love on her.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Buda, please visit tirrrescue.org/buda.",

She came from the Okemah pound in Sept 2016. Your donations helped us save her! Reo is a young female Pit Bull Terrier, 3 years old now. She weighs right at 50 lbs. She is black with beautiful white markings and a white tip on her tail. She loves to play and run. She is a cuddle bug too! She likes to be in your lap and give kisses :) She gets along with other dogs and loves to play. She has played with many foster dogs at her current foster home and has done great with all ages and sizes. She is a real sweetheart and will make someone a very loyal companion. She is scared of thunder. She has not lived with cats or kids. She does good with older kids. Small ones in her face makes her nervous. Reo is spayed, utd on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on monthly prevention, flea and tick free and microchipped. Her adoption fee is reduced to $50. We desperately want to get Reo into a home of her own. She has waited way too long. Please share and help Reo! Apply online at www.arlorescue.org. Once approved we will set up a time to meet Reo.",

Honey came to us terrified, timid, and obviously had known nothing but hate most of her life. She would hide in her house, cower down when we would go to pet her. It took several weeks for Honey to relax. She finally decided she enjoyed belly rubs and butt scratches. She would stand to be petted and she was starting to trust her small circle of people. She was smiling and carrying herself with joy again. Honey is good with other dogs. She is a 4 year old Staffordshire Terrier. She is short and stout. She is still shy of new people and things and takes time to warm up. We want nothing more than a loving home for Honey. She would probably do best in a quieter home, no small children with someone willing to be patient with Honey. Adoption fee is reduced to $50. This includes her spay, deworming, vaccinations, flea/tick control, heartworm neg and started on monthly prevention and microchip. Apply to adopt at www.arlorescue.org",

            "description": "Meet darling Rusty, a young (about three years) loving boy who wants to please. He's had some basic training and tries hard to do his best! He's great friends with our other Misfit dogs, walks well in harness, and is alert and always checking with you to see what's next! He is a cautious first-time greeter. He wants to sniff you and hear your voice and think a bit about who you might be before he relaxes into the love sponge he really is inside. He may have had some bad prior experiences with strange men, so go slow at first meeting. Kennel and house trained, he loves people, and uses his Mind Toys (rubber chewy toys with treats inside) to great effect. He's a very smart dog and needs someone who can be firmly consistent with love and training. He just wants you to love him!\n\nHe enjoys car rides and will just lay down and enjoy the motion.\n\nRusty was dumped at the boat ramp at Lake Nacogdoches with a choke collar that would barely turn and was zip tied on. He would just sit by the dumpster and wait for his person to return. \n\nHeartworm NEGATIVE. He is up to date on vaccinations and on HW prevention. \nWeight 61 pounds.\nAge approximately 1-2 years old. \n\nRusty is like the energizer bunny. You can NOT wear him out. He loves loves tearing across the yard for a tossed tennis ball. If you are looking for a couch potato friend, he would NOT fit the bill. He would love to share a home with another high energy dog that would say yes to \"chase me\". Because he is high energy, and needs firm reminders NOT to jump on you, he  would be best suited in a home with older children.",

We are looking for some very specific things in an adoptive home due to his shy and skittish behavior. Nimbus has a flight history (6 months on the run before being trapped) before coming to our program and although he has improved a lot socially over time, he still panics at change in the routine and social circle he has come to know. We would like to find an adopter close enough who can visit him multiple times to build some trust before adoption. A few specifics about Nimbus:\n-He should do well with a well socialized, dog friendly, large breed female canine companion. \n-He walks well on leash unless startled, has learned to ride well and handles well at the vet and groomer. \n-Once aquainted he loves hugs and attention.\n-He will require house training and work on some marking behavior. \n-Adult only home with rescue baggage experienced adopter willing to work with him to become the best he can be. \n-Securely fenced yard no less than 5 feet in height for safe yard time.\n\nIf you think you could be the the special adopter Nimbus needs please contact us by email for more information. \n \nAdoption info and an application can be found at gprci.com",

Because of the brindle coloring, I'm thinking he may have some plott hound or greyhound in him.\n\nChristopher is a high energy boy who needs lots of love. He loves people and would enjoy long walks/runs and would probably make a great hiking companion. He would do best with an active family and as the only dog. He does not get along with other dogs and is not good with cats. He is also a digger and will dig under a fence if not supervised.\n\nChristopher is in a small shelter in Lytle, TX and can be adopted locally or transported to your area once adopted. If you are interested in adopting Christopher, please call Lytle Animal Care and Control at 830-709-3832.",

I also enjoy toys, being outside, treats (motivated), walking and starting to learn basic manners. I love to jump around and play with some dogs, other dogs scare me sometimes. I was a return so I'm still learning my manners, working through some things, I am fully crate and potty trained. I would love an active family that would play with me, walk me, cuddle me, allow me to follow them around and do enrichment activities to keep me learning. My foster family loves to look into my beautiful eyes and pet my soft fur. Could you be my forever family?\n\nExperienced owner a must!\n\n*BSL Restrictions may apply.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He is on a dietthe good thing is that he loves green beans!\n\nHe likes his crate but he does not need it as he is a super chill dog.\n\nHe is house trained, and he knows how to communicate with you when he needs to go outHe knows what he wants, and he will express it in a bossy way! Such a goofy personality!\n\nHe \"loooooves\" leash-walking, and despite the fact he is strong, he does not pullbut he does love to stop to smell the flowers or roll in the grass.\n\nRidley can be playful, but would rather spend time on the couch with you. He is not super cuddly and he likes his space, but you know he loves you when you see him wag his tail each time he hears your voice.\n\nHe would do best in an environment with no dogs and no cats because he can be unpredictable around them.\n\nRidley can be overwhelmed in a new environment and with new people. However, all he needs is a patient and loving person to show him that everything is all right.\n\nHe is a great dog who just wants his own person!\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

He loves leash walks, likes most people, and is fine around most other dogs. Woody has a heart murmur, not unusual for a dog his age, but has no related problems and requires no medication. He's very cute, loving, and well-behaved. Woody has short little legs, a long body, and a smile that's a real heart-warmer. He also has a current dental and most of his teeth are still there, clean, and healthy! Woody's vision is starting to get a bit weak as far a depth perception, but he gets around great and his hearing and scent skills are way up there! This gentleman may be a bit old, but he acts and thinks young, and he's just plain FUN!",

Bell has been in a home in which she did not get along with the resident dogs. At the shelter, Bell is barrier reactive with the other dogs. At this time we believe that Bell would do best as the only pet in the home. Bell has been around older children and has done well. However she has been around a newborn and was not amused. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. With older children and adults, we have found Bell to be very personable. Before the pandemic, Bell was able to visit several assisted living facilities in our area to visit with the residents. She very much enjoyed this experience. Bell has been on several weeklong slumber parties. On two of these slumber parties, the clients reported that she never had any potty accidents in the home. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Bell. (Updated 1/30/21).",

            "description": "Update: (2-11-20) Ryker has spent quite a while living at the shelter at this point and has deemed his kennel his safe place. He growls and barks at people who visit him while he is in his kennel. However, once taken out he is usually very loving to the people he's met. He has even allowed a volunteer to walk him only meeting the volunteer at that point and there were no issues at all. He was happy and enjoying his time outside of the shelter. He will just need a home without small children or any other pets.\n\nRyker came in on 9-12-18. He had such severe injuries that we thought he had been bit by a car. Upon Vet examination, it was determined that he was actually a victim of a dog attack. He had found a forever home at first to heal and connect with his forever family in the mean time. However, within a week we had found out that he didn't do well with the adopter's 6 month old child. At that point, it was decided that it was better for him to come back to the shelter to find another forever home. He did have a problem with digging out of fences so he would need a home where he couldn't dig out or isn't left outside unattended. He does great with older children and is just a total love bug. He loves to climb in your lap and give hugs. Now that he is all healed, he needs to find his own forever family to love.\n\nThere is a $65 fee for adopting one of our male dogs/puppies or a $75 fee for adopting one of our female dogs/puppies. The fee helps cover the Spay/Neuter vouchers and the Rabies Vaccine voucher. Please look at our home page for more information about a adopting a new friend.",

            "description": "Hello there and welcome to my Petfinder page. I am Mars Barkley and I am looking for a home to call my own. I am looking for a forever place and someone to love. Let me know if you think we could be a great match.\n\nHere\u2019s my stats:\nPossible Breed:  Shih Tzu/Lhasa Apso \nGender:  I\u2019m a boy pup\nColors:  Classic black and white\nAge:  The vet says about 9 years young\nWeight:  Around 18 pounds\n\nIdeal Home:  I would be fine as an only dog, and I can live with other male dogs too.\n\nNow for more good stuff!-\nMars is a laid-back boy. Some might even call him a couch potato, but he does get down from the couch and play from time to time! He is more of an independent boy, though he does still like to cuddle too.\n\nMars gets along with both the boy and older girl pups in his foster home. He especially likes to play with the bigger dog who lives there. He doesn\u2019t really play with toys very often. He does enjoy chewing on hard bones. Mars walks great on a leash and really enjoys going for walks with you. He rides well in the car and he does well hanging out in a crate.\n\nHe can be a bit grumpy sometimes when you want him to do something, he doesn\u2019t want to do. He will growl and snap, so an experienced dog owner is best. Because of this he must go into a home with no kids under 16.\n\nLike many other Tzu and Lhasa pups, Mars has dry eye. He gets drops twice a day. We believe he has some limited vision due to this issue. \nHis foster family says, \u201cMars prefers men, He even feel asleep on his foster dad\u2019s lap the other day.\u201d\n\nFor more information, email my foster mom at mel65shot@gmail.com. Start the process of adopting me or one of the other pups by filling out the application found at www.shihtzu-rescue.com. \n\nPS. I've had ALL my vetting, and oh boy, it was a lot. Here's what I had done:\nDistemper/Parvo shots \u2013 TWICE. One shot doesn't cut it.\nBordetella shots - ALSO TWICE. \nSpay/Neuter-of course.\nA fecal exam so I don't have any bad worms. Treatment if I do.\nA heartworm test. Treatment if I am positive for heart worms\nBLOODWORK to make sure my liver and kidneys are working well, because you know, we doggies often have issues in the liver and kidneys.\nA DENTAL exam AND cleaning if I needed it- yep, all my toofies are checked out.\nSee, that's a LOT. Ask your vet - that's a LOT.\n\n",

Bubbles is an energetic, enthusiastic love-machine. She is the most cuddly and affectionate dog I've ever met. She loves to lay her chin on your chest and gaze into your eyes.\n\nBubs is a Boxer/Bulldog/Terrier/Ridgeback-ish? mix of something. She is low to the ground but quick and strong. 52 pounds of love and about 4 years old!\n\nSmart. Stubborn. Sweet. Funny. Snorty...And from a color perspective has the most beautiful tones of brown. She has chocolate brown eye liner and her eyes are the color of warm whiskey.\n\nBubs is looking for a great home. She HAS to be the only dog. She is great on a leash and loves short walks. She loves to run zoomies in the backyard (do not recommend these in the house!) and is a great watch dog. We believe she could be taught to skateboard, surf, kayak, carry a pack, do therapy work (with a bit more training). She is up for anything.\n\nBubbles needs to be with her people. She loves people. She is a really special girl and hoping to find a great, loving home. \n\nWe are a RESCUE GROUP, not a shelter, and all of our animals are in foster homes. To start the adoption process, email us at adoptions@earstexas.org requesting an application. Submitting an application does not commit you in any way, but helps us make the best match between people and our available dogs. Your current or past dogs must be inside dogs who have been spayed/neutered and are on heartworm prevention.\n\nAll of the dogs in our program are inside dogs and are completely vetted including all vaccinations, spayed/neutered, free of internal parasites, microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention before adoption. Our adoption process includes an application, check of vet records or personal references, interview, neutral site meet & greet with the dog and your family, and a home visit.",

We do not ship our dogs and all adoptions are completed in person in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area.\nUpdate 1/2019 I did it! I have graduated from a training program. I am leash, house, agility course and crate trained. I know my basic commands and a few tricks too. Adopt me now so we can continue to work on my manners together.\nHello. My name is Frodo. I am male over nine years old that weighs about 21 pounds. I am a pinscher mix or at least that is my best guess. I came to the rescue with my two fur sisters after mom couldn't take care of us anymore. I know she loved us but sometimes life just happens and we are forced to deal with change. Both of my sisters are already in new homes so I am looking for a family for me.I consider myself an easy going guy although I will announce anyone at the door or a strange noise. I like most other dogs and cats. I haven't been around a lot of children but if they are at least school age I don't think we would have a problem. I am housebroken so I can easily live inside with you. I do want you to know I may be older but I still love to run and play in the fenced yard when I go outside. Sometimes I get too excited and jump up and down. Hopefully you like that excitement to see you and can love me anyways.I have been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. I have had my teeth cleaned with a few extractions done. My adoption fee is 100.00. So now all you have to do is go to dogsasfamily.org and fill out the adoption application for Frodo. You and I could make a great family. Hope to meet you soon.",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: American Staffordshire Terrier\nGender: Male\nEstimated Date of Birth: December 23, 2017\nSize: 68 lbs\nLocation: Marietta, GA\n\nRESCUING CAMO\nCamo ended up at Henry County Animal Control where pit bulls are not adopted out to the public. Lucky for him, FTTF has some amazing foster families! Camo was on a foster to adopt with a family, but they decided their teenager was not pulling her weight when it came to taking care of him so they returned him. Camo had no problem adjusting to a new foster home with dogs he had never met before. This guy is solid!\n\nABOUT CAMO\nCamo is a fantastic, goofy boy. A Wisdom Panel DNA test revealed that he is 100% American Staffordshire Terrier. He has a medium energy level and is well-behaved in the home. He loves to play a good game of fetch as it's his all-time favorite activity. Seriously, the ball is life! Although he is not overly demanding in his exercise requirements, he does benefit from a bit of daily exercise. A simple 15 minute session of fetch with a Chuck-It is enough to keep him happy. He actually seems to enjoy (and is quite good at) walking on the treadmill too. Camo also loves toys and will entertain himself for hours with a plain and simple Kong. He still thinks he is a small puppy and is not aware of his massive size, but he is a super-snuggler and will happily lounge on the sofa with his family. He loves to roughhouse with doggie foster siblings and he even takes correction from the bossier lady in the home, however he is not suited for a home with cats or children under 16 years old. He is rocking his house-manners and \"Good Boy\" is his favorite phrase to hear aside from \"Are You Hungry\" or \"Play Ball.\" Without daily exercise, a state of playful excitement is easily incited where he gets extra silly and boisterous. This is when his foster mom refers to him as \"Wreck-It-Ralph.\" He thrives on firm, consistent boundaries, but he does listen to direction and he will need a savvy owner with strong leadership skills. Camo can be a bit sensitive so a stern voice correction is all he needs to put his listening ears on. He knows he is not allowed in the kitchen when food is being prepared so with a finger snap he is quick to exit and sit at the boundary. His foster mom tries to discourage begging too so he will also get in his bed or out of the room when people are eating. He is crate-trained and housebroken and requires a 6 foot, privacy fenced yard. Just call him Mister Personality - everyone that meets him falls in love! This goober-face is just a big, mushy, enthusiastic puppy who is looking for a forever family to call his own.\n\nCamo has been eating Hills Science Diet Sensitive Stomach & Skin Dry Dog Food. It is not a prescription diet and can be ordered on Chewy or purchased from any pet store. The NutriSource food eaten by the other dogs in our program was a tad bit rich for him and he had loose poops. There are likely other foods he would do well on, this was just the first alternative we tried. Camo also takes 1 Apoquel tablet a day to keep his environmental allergies at bay. We just toss it in his bowl with his dinner and he eats it - easy!\n\nFollow Camo on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/findingforeverfttf\n\nPhoto Album of Camo: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2072989432759212&type=1&l=9b3b11764c\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and fed premium grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "\"Hi! I'm Francesca and I'm just waiting for you to fall in love with me! I'm all about the people - snuggling with my humans is my favorite activity! I live to make people happy and getting a big kiss and a treat is my ultimate reward. How can you not love my sweet eyes and wiggly butt? In my dream home, I'd be the only dog so I could be queen of your heart. While I love every person I've ever met, other dogs aren't my thing and I'd prefer not to be around them. But if you've got a home with a yard and a couch to cuddle on, I've got an endless supply of kisses and love for you. One kiss and you'll be hooked on me forever!\"\n\nThis special girl is a total love, but she wants you all to herself and cannot go to a home with other animals. Francesca is an absolute people pleaser and when it comes to humans is a social butterfly. It's hard to not give in to those deep eyes, squish and that wiggle butt! Francesca is part of our enrichment program and has stolen the hearts of our volunteers. In the program she is learning basic manners as she awaits her fur-ever home. Her ideal home is active, but understanding that she does not get along well with other dogs. She would thrive in an environment with with a yard and a place where walking her will not lead to running into too many other dogs (apartments, downtown city etc.) and someone willing to give her a little training and guidance. This goofball would give you a shower with her kisses if you let her. She is the perfect balance of a playful wild child and cuddle bug who will curl up with you at the end of the day to relax.\n\nFind out how to meet Francesca by giving us a call at 410-268-4388.",

I get very excited, and am kinda all over the place when I first meet a new person, but once you give me a chance, and let me know you are mine, I will love you fur-ever! I am a loyal, passionate girl, and I expect the same from you. I don't like to share with other animals! You will be my moon and my stars, is it so bad that I want the same level of dedication from you? I love so deeply that I am happy to just cuddle and stare lovingly into your eyes for hours.\n\nGreatest asset: I am super goofy! I'll have you laughing for hours!\n\nBiggest flaw: Like I said, I don't like to share. If you are mine, you are ONLY mine (at least as far as other animals go. I'm cool with other humans).\n\nTheme song: I Only Have Eyes For You, The Flamingos\n\nLooking for a long term commitment?: Yes, please! I've been single for about 3 years now.\n\nHobbies: Beyond staring into your soul through your eyes? I like tug-of-war, walks, and cuddles. Lots of cuddles!\n\nIdeal Partner: An experienced dog parent who is willing to adapt to my needs and love me for who I am, flaws and all.",

I am pretty mature and sophisticated, however, I do still know how to show my silly side! My Silly Sally side, if you will. I would love to find a home where I can play ball outside with my humans, then come inside and cuddle up on the couch. Oh, and do you have chickens outside? No problem! I don't want to eat them, like a lot of dogs, I just want to be their furry friend! I would prefer to be the only pet or be adopted to a very knowledgeable family because I do have some resource guarding issues with other pets. If I sound like the right dog for your family, please contact Sooty's Sanctuary to set up a meeting.",

Zulu would prefer a home without children and other pets because she wants you all to herself. She loves to play and for a small/medium sized dog, she's quite muscular and athletic. She would love a human that will take her camping, hiking, or even casual daily walking and then come home to snuggle with.\n\nZulu is very smart and loves enrichment activities, such as puzzles, and will amaze you with her focus and problem solving skills. Zulu even loves swimming, but watch out as she will try to \"save\" you if you are swimming with her! Worried you can't keep up with this active girl? Don't worry! Zulu has been trained to run on a treadmill and actually needs more mental stimulation than she does physical exertion. Zulu will keep you entertained with her antics! She also loves to play fetch!\n\nDo you need a playful, entertaining, wacky partner to navigate through this equally crazy life? Then Zulu is waiting for you!\n1/31/21 7:00 PM",

Unfortunately, Mako had a few incidents where he did lash out at the child. So, the answer was to put a shock collar on him to attempt to stop his behavior. As many should know this was the worst thing possible for him. He was scared, insecure and was being punished for protecting himself. Once back in our care in the loving foster home that raised him from an 11-day old puppy the shock collar was removed and thrown away. After many weeks of building trust Mako is finally relaxing and showing us what a sweet boy he really is. He adores his foster mom and dad and is learning daily from his foster skin siblings that not all children are going to try to hurt him. He enjoys playing with other dogs and is great with cats. Mako is kennel trained and house broken. He LOVES going for walks, car rides and playing tug of war. Mako\u2019s forever home will need to have NO CHILDREN for his protection. He needs a family that will give him time to adjust and build trust. He needs to not be pushed and let him take things at his own pace. Mako needs a mom or dad that will be the alpha and let him know that he will be protected. Once he figures this out, he will become your shadow and the goofiest, most loyal dog you have ever met. Mako is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Let the storm pass and the love he will give you will last a lifetime!\n\nA DNA test was done on one of his siblings and Mako is a German Shepherd, Greyhound, ChowChow, Alaskan Malamute, AmStaff, Rottweiler, hound mix. He is built like a Greyhound, has the coat of a GSD and the most adorable ears of a ChowChow. He weighs around 67 pounds and is a true Heinze 57 dog!\n\n\n\nLittle did the rescuers know when they found an injured dog on the side of the road that in the nearby cornfield, she would be hiding a little secret. Eight little secrets to be exact! At only two days old Mako and his siblings were rescued from a life of uncertainty to be given a life hope with Hands, Hearths and Paws. Born on 8/19/2018 Mako is a typical happy little boy. A DNA test was done on one of his siblings and the results were 12.5% Alaskan Malamute, 12.5% German Shepherd Dog, 12.5% ChowChow, 12.5% Greyhound, 16.3% American Staffordshire Terrier, 16.3% Rottweiler and 16.3% unknown mixed breed. Though he possesses a few traits of each breed, he definitely took on more of the German Shepherd look. His mom, Sharkie, is only 40 pounds but if we had to guess we would say he will be more likely 60+ pounds when full grown. He loves playing with his brothers and sisters and even enjoys wrestling with the resident kitty in his foster home every now and then. Meal time and cuddle time are a couple of his favorite times of the day. He is working hard on housebreaking and would love a family who would help him continue on with his training. Mako is an absolute joy who would make a great addition to any home\u2026. could that home be with you?\n\nBorn 8/19/18 to mom Sharkie.  Petfinder requires a breed mix, but these pups are only mixed breed pups, not only the breeds listed.  DNA showed 6+ mixed breeds.\n\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $275___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard, we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

We have had a trainer here and he has come a long way,  but is still fearful of strangers. I feel the rescue has done everything we can  and it is t ime to help him find the perfect home. He needs a home without a ton of new people coming and going. He will love his person/people with all of his heart, but new people have to be either introduced slowly and with him on a leash, or he needs to do into another room while company is there. He is difficult to catch when he is excited,  like when someone new comes in. He will run from you and do circles. He will never be good with strangers. He will mark your furniture when upset. \n\n He is the sweetest most cuddly dog you will ever meet after he gets to know you. He loves kisses and playing fetch. He is housebroken and crate trained and likes playing with the other dogs in his foster home.  \n\nI know this will have to be the perfect match and his new person will have to be a very experienced dog handler. If not, he will end up biting someone and we don't want that to happen.\n\nPedey is up to date on vax and neutered. He is about 10 years old and 18 pounds. His adoption fee is 250.00.

This is a very special breed and not common here in Florida. They are not for everyone and certainly not if you live in a condo. Needs a home and some land. He is a Treeing Walker Coonhound. He was a stray and went unclaimed. He was stressed in the kennel and needed to get out. His weight is 42LBS. Good health and a great heart!! He is fine with other dogs, just like to sniff around and around. What a nose!!!!!!! He is now in foster care in the country and that is great for him. He loves it!! He loves to ride on the tractor and loves to go after everything who is moving!! He is a great boy...  If you are worry about rats he will take care of them. Great hunting dog. We know that dogs in shelter are very stressed and only a few of them actually make it to adoption. Bo was tested and had no issues in the beginning. just needs a hand. Very handsome dog!! if you would like to meet him and adopt him please fill out the application online at www.findahomegiveahome.com  His adoption fee is $200.  His adoption fee will go toward training.",

            "description": "Logan was adopted pretty quickly when he was here before because he is such a good boy!  BUT ... he is back again .... but it isn't his fault.  For some reason, sometimes, Logan has seizures .... :-(  His (now previous) owner's couldn't find any triggers or pattern to the few they witnessed and their vet didn't want to put him on medicine since he doesn't have them often.  His owners have had 2 human babies since adoption Logan and the fear of such a giant dog flailing around and them in the middle of it is just too much.  So, we are consulting with our homeopathic vet to address Logan's seizures.  Adjustments are also being made to his diet to reduce his chances of another seizure.  But if the right family was prepared to take on such a dog, he is a great and sweet boy that likes everyone - including other pets and children.  He is obedient and happy.  Please email for a questionnaire if you are interested in Logan.  Pictures coming soon!  \n\nLogan is 2  1/2 years old and black with a little white on his chest and some toes.  He has uncropped ears and an average stature.\n\n******************************************************************************************************\nDetails later - just wanting to get the new ones in the system!!\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please e-mail Charity for a questionnaire at shebangsrescue@yahoo.com\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are a very busy pet health retail store so e-mail is easier for us to communicate with you!</p>",

We had committed up to $1,500.00 for her emergency care at our vet. It was clear she would need supplemental oxygen overnight at an emergency clinic. In contacting three different ER clinics, we were astounded at the costs for overnight oxygen at $1,300.00 - $3,000.00. During the late afternoon, we spent almost 3 hours with Shelby, continuing to hope that her oxygen levels would rise. By 5.00 pm, her levels were maintaining at only 64%. We were helping with the administration of direct oxygen through a nasal tube. Our vets were amazing with suggestions and stayed long past closing time to help Shelby. But in the end, at 6.40 pm, Shelby, on her own terms, left us to travel to the Rainbow Bridge. This sweet angel is now running free. We are heartbroken at the loss.\n\n1-11-21: Shelby is hospitalized with low oxygen levels (under 80%). She is currently being given oxygen and may need to be transferred to an overnight emergency clinic so she can continue to have oxygen administered to her.\n\n1-9-21: Shelby returned to the vet this morning to check her oxygen levels. She is refusing food. Shelby has returned to her foster home to be carefully monitored in case she needs to be transferred to an emergency clinic over the weekend.\n\n1-8-21: A day full of tests for Shelby... Bloodwork, complete abdominal ultrasound, urinalysis, and x-rays. After being on oxygen for several hours, our vets began these tests to determine what is causing Shelby's breathing issues. All test results were sent to a Pathologist who then determined no cancer has been found in her organs or lungs. She does have some fluid in her lungs, which is now being treated with antibiotics. The doctors, as well as us, are all \"stumped\" as to what is causing Shelby's problems. She is now back at her foster home and will be closely watched over the weekend.\n\n1-7-21: Today, for yet unknown reasons, Shelby began having difficulty breathing and was rushed to our vet. X-rays show some irregular areas in her lungs, but all of her blood tests have normal results. We are nervously waiting for the results of an in-depth abdominal ultrasound.\n\n11-2-20: Shelby's urine culture results have come in and she is now resistant to Doxycycline and a Sulpha drug that we have used in the past. A new Rx has been called into our pharmacy, which we will pick up tomorrow and start her newest treatment. It's worrisome that she is having to take so many different antibiotics to clear the UTI.\n\n10-28-20: Yet again, we are battling another UTI with Shelby. 2 weeks of Doxycycline did not help this time. We've now sent out a sterile sample to be cultured ($165 each time), which will let us know which specific medication will \"kill\" her current infection. She is back at her foster home tonight, after being at the vet all day. The sweetheart has been sleeping all evening.\n\n9-2-20: We have been treating Shelby with a specific antibiotic after a urine culture determined which medication would stop her constant urinary infections. While we believe her UTI's are resolved, they may continue to occur, resulting in accidents.\n\n5-12-20 Shelby is at the vet today. We are attempting to determine why she is having recurring UTI's. We'll post more information after test results are received.\n\nShelby should be adopted by a family that has the time, patience and experience to care for a blind dog. She startles easily and should not be around small children.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: 10-8-18 Shelby was groomed and looks and feels FANTASTIC! She has almost completely recovered from her 11 dental extractions and we are now slowly increasing her food mix from all soft food to both wet & dry. She remains on antibiotic medications.\n\nShelby came to us when her human could no longer care for her. Shelby is an adorably sweet Scottie who lost her sight some time ago. Shelby is completely blind.\n\nOur first priority was taking her to our vet for a complete physical, blood tests, fecal and urinalysis, in addition to testing for heartworms, Ehrlichia , Anaplasmosis and Lyme disease. Shelby needed a dental in the worst way, which was done the following morning. Sadly, she lost 11 teeth to decay.\n\nIn just 48 hours, we have already expended over $750.00 for this precious girl and are asking for help with her medical costs. A donation button is located on our website: www.scottiekingdom.com\n\nor\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX 75355\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAll dogs adopted by Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc. have had a full medical exam by one of our licensed Veterinarians, which includes testing (and treatment, if necessary) for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis, all necessary vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, dental cleaning as necessary, microchipping, registration of the microchip, and any other medical needs each particular dog may need. Copies of all available medical records are transferred to you when the adoption is finalized.\n\nWe prefer to adopt to families with past Scottie, Westie, Terrier experience, but realize this isn't always possible. We do NOT ship our pets. If you have that special place in your heart, and in your home, for a Scottie (or any of our other available rescue dogs), please visit us in Dallas for an in person meet & greet session with our available dogs. If you have existing dogs, they should travel to Dallas with you, so we can be assured that they will be compatible with the new addition to your family.\n\nPlease contact us at\nRescue@scottiekingdom.com\nto receive an Adoption Application or for more information on our Adoption process. Also, please take the time to visit our website\nwww.scottiekingdom.com\nfor additional information.\n\nWe sometimes receive several applications on the same dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible, based on his/her needs, personality and past history. Please note: Adoptions are not done on a first come, first served basis. Submitting an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog. We are looking for the best available home for each of our rescue dogs.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for considering adoption!\n\nWe are\nnot\nsupported by your tax dollars or public grants, rather, we rely on donations to help us continue our rescue work for animals that are in need.\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX\n\n75355\n\n2/2/21 10:46 AM",

I am told that I am likely a Red Heeler and Lab mix.  I am very friendly and love everyone.  I think I was born around February 1, 2017.  I weigh about 48 pounds.  I am very friendly and love everyone!\n\nI was likely dumped on a country road near Overton, TX.  A nice family took me in and gave me food and water.  Sadly, they did not know that I should have been spayed.  I ended up having two litters of puppies.  After the 2nd litter the family decided they needed help.  The family surrendered all of us to Penny.  \n\nI am so excited about the possibility of getting my very own forever home.  You have no idea how happy that would make me.  I want so much to have a family that will make me a family member and not just throw me in the yard, likely forgetting about me.\n\nI am up to date on my Vaccinations, spayed and heart worm negative!  I am all ready to go to my new home!\n\nPlease consider giving me a chance.  I am a great girl looking for a second chance at a great life and being the best companion you ever had.\n\nFreckles",

He learns quickly and is so devoted to his person that he watches them intently for what they want him to do. He is always trying to please the person he's with and craves their attention, he also gets very protective over his person as well. Because of this Tobias will need to be an only animal as he wouldn't want anyone else around his person.\n\nSomething you should know about Tobias is that he LOVES to play! He is obsessed with toys so you better have a toybox ready for when he comes home. He can't get enough toys and you're sure to be buying him a new one every time you go to the store!\n\n\nAll C.A.R.E rescue dogs are fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, spayed/neutered, worm/flea free, and most are microchipped! So all you need to provide is the love.\n\nFill out an adoption application here: http://www.carerescue.org/dog-application\n\nOur adoption fee is a minimum $100 tax deductible donation. All donations are used for rescue and medical care of animals in need. If you don't have room to take home a pet but want to support our efforts to save animals in need, please consider making a donation. We are not city or state funded and rely solely on private donations that allow us to continue saving lives.\n\nTo learn more about us or to give a life saving donation please visit http://www.carerescue.org",

He does well with dogs his own size or larger, but should not be around smaller dogs or cats.  He does listen very well when on a leash..  A sweet boy who was under nourished when he came to us, he's filling out nicely.  He was diagnosed HW positive, but is undergoing treatment (oral) and will be ready to meet his new family very soon.

Is fascinated by squirrels\n This kind lady took this pretty girl to the vet and had her brought up to date on her shots and spayed.  \nShe can not keep her much longer. Be ashamed to have her go to a shelter after being on the road for so long.\nPlease consider helping.\n\nCYNTHIACARTER-ROSS@HOTMAIL.COM  is the lady to contact if there are any questions.",

Hoss does better with girl dogs than boys, as he is big and intimidating to most male dogs. Hoss is great with people, but would do better in a home with older children due to his size and playful nature.\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Appointments can be made by calling 334-508-2367 or emailing troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

His cardiologist tells us it is likely he will not make it to adulthood.

If it wasn't for P&P I would be long gone by now as I was in a southern shelter and slated to be euthanized, but P&P loves all dogs and took a chance on me and brought me into the rescue.  \n\nI would need to be your one and only companion, so no dogs or kitties for me please. I LOVE to eat, eat, eat and food is definitely a way to my heart since at times it might take me some time to warm up. My Foster Mom says that I have a funny personality and I love to relax on the couch as well as to go shopping and ride in the car.\n\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me.

            "description": "Beautiful Girl Elle is a VERY sweet girl, and looking for that one family or person who she will make her everything.  She would do best either as Queen of the Castle OR with a Male dog or a younger dog/puppy (2 or under but should be male).  She does very well with younger dogs/puppies as she was a one time momma dog and still loves to play  She is used to being an indoor dog and being very loved.  She knows basic commands and has had basic training on lead, along with sit, down, giving paw, etc.\n\nElle is a beautiful very light brindle color with white markings. She is so sweet and loving - and listens very well, just wanting to please.  Need an Emotional Support Dog?  Elle is your girl!!  She's obedient and just loves to love. She can become protective of her family, so an experienced dog person is needed.  She is our longest member at the rescue, so she is truly deserving of her forever home NOW!\n\nElle just wants to enjoy her youth, she is pretty laid back for a Pittie, but every once in awhile likes to get her Ya-Ya's out. Elle would love be the love of someone's life.  She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, microchipped, and wormed, so a warm bed, food, and someone to love is all of her requirements. \n\n***SideNote: Elle has been tried in an Apartment Environment and was over-stimulated by the noises and lots of people and dogs - so she will need to be adopted out into a Single Family Home Environment Only****\n\nNOTE: No Apartments will be considered for our large dog placements.  We also do NOT adopt out Out of State - adoptions are confined within a 2 hour drive from 92590 zip code\n\nPlease consider this gorgeous girl as she will provide tons of LOVE into your home.",

Trixie's previous owner housed her in a dilapidated shed where she had a litter of 8 puppies she was protecting. Trixie's strong instince of survival and protection of her puppies and her \"home\" caused her to chase anyone near and around her area. Trixie has come a long way. Her puppies were all adopted and we have worked with her to overcome her aggression. Trixie absolutely ADORES her people, but her people aren't her people until she gains your trust which takes time and patience. Trixie has a tendency to guard what is hers whether it's her space, her food, or her people. We are looking for a good home for our girl with an experienced dog owner, a big yard with a sturdy and contained fence and play yard because she loves to play and she LOVES the water. If you would be interested in meeting this awesome girl, please contact us at arcc.rescue@gmail.com",

Ollie always has a look on his face that never fails to draws you over and gets him lots of petting.  :)  Ollie was born around August 2015 and weighs 55 lbs.  He's friendly and calm and just wants someone to love him. Due to his size and preference to have all the attention on him he needs a home with adults only.\n\nOllie has heartworms but we will see him through this.  Heartworms aren't contagious, you and other animals will not contract heartworms from him.  They're curable when caught early and show no outward symptoms except in advanced cases (coughing).  Heartworms are caused by mosquitoes and are all too common here in the south but are completely preventable with an inexpensive monthly pill.  Ollie is taking a monthly pill (which we'll pay for) until a blood test (which we'll also pay for) shows he's rid of them.  This could take 6 months to over a year.  We've had many happy adopters who've rescued a heartworm-positive dog.  Speak to your vet if you need more feedback.\n\nEmail Homelesspetsfoundation@gmail.com or call 770-971-0100 for more info. To increase your odds of having first dibs on an animal, fill out an adoption application, found at www.homelesspets.com/adoption-form.\n\nAdoption fees include spaying/neutering, micro-chipping, vaccinations up to date at the time of adoption, one free check-up at Town & Country main vet clinic within 14 days of adoption, a free session with Tenasity dog trainers and 6 months of Affordable Pet Care.",

I am spayed, UTD, and microchipped. I am crate trained and potty trained. I am an excellent walker as well. If you would like more information about me you can send my fosters a text at (209)395-9549 or email them at findingabestfriend@gmail.com\n\nPs if I have my leash on and I would like to be walked or I need to go potty I will hand you my leash so you can take me out for a walk!",

            "description": "Noel\n\nBreed: American Pit Bull Terrier, Boxer mix\nHousetrained: Partially\nCompatibility with other animals: Must be the only pet\nCompatibility with children: Best in a home with no children or children visitors\nKnows: Sit \nPreferred home environment: Securely fenced-in yard (six feet high or taller) required \nIntake date/origin: December 2017, found stray\nVetting: Already spayed, microchipped, and UTD on vaccines including rabies\nAdoption fee: $150\nLocation: Shelter facility\n\nNoel is a wonderful dog for the right person. Sweet and silly, she is desperately looking for somebody who will foster or adopt her and provide her with the guidance and direction she has never received. Having lived in the shelter system since December 2017, Noel has developed some habits that we believe could be more easily corrected if she was in a different environment. Even if you are not the person who is able to provide for Noel\u2019s needs, please share her information far and wide in hopes that somebody else will step up and give her a chance.\n\nBorn in 2016, Noel arrived as an unclaimed stray one week before Christmas in 2017. Noel has blossomed into a sweet, loving, playful, and happy girl, having a knack at making her caregivers smile at her silly antics. She also seems to have a special talent for jumping very high, so she must have a tall, secure fence (six feet high or taller) to ensure she cannot escape if she sees something worth \u201cinvestigating.\u201d Although Noel did not appear to be housetrained when she was in a larger kennel, she does seem to \u201chold it\u201d better when in a more confined crate. With a consistent schedule and boundaries, she may do well with housetraining when in a home.\n\nNoel\u2019s biggest issue is meeting new people. Some people she likes, but others she doesn\u2019t like. We don\u2019t know if her behavior has changed since living in the stressful shelter environment or if she was never properly socialized as a puppy, but anybody interested in fostering or adopting her will need to meet her several times. Additionally, any household where Noel goes (at least for the time being) should have few or no visitors. As far as other animals are concerned, Noel has shown aggression toward other female dogs. Although she previously had a male dog friend who she loved to play with, she must be the only pet unless otherwise determined. \n\nThe longer Noel remains in the shelter environment, the harder we know it will be for her to find a home. Although we can wish all we want that the perfect person will come and adopt Noel, we know that it won\u2019t happen unless Noel receives some training. Since she is still so young, we think her bad habits can be managed, if not trained out of her. Her behavior might also improve when out of the shelter environment. \n\nWe may not be able to change the world for all dogs; but if we all work together, we can change the world for Noel. And one dog at a time, a difference can be made.\n\nWill you help us help Noel?",

He also would get stressed out when the young grandchildren were in the house.  Cody did nip his owner and we felt it would be better for him to come back to us.  Our trainer has worked with Cody and evaluated his behavior.  He has not exhibited any aggressive behavior and is doing quite well.  Cody will need an adult home that will continue positive reinforcement training.  He will need daily rigorous exercise and an experienced handler to help him gain the confidence he needs.  This is a wonderful dog that just needs to find the right family.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog, please submit an application on our website:  thesimonfoundation.org",

When he first arrived at HUA he was absolutely terrified and just a sad shrinking violet. Everything startled him and he was so unsure. Now that he is comfortable he is so happy - he has serious 'ups' - he bounces SO HIGH in excitement when caregivers and volunteers visit him. We wonder if there was abuse in his past, because Mozart still startles a bit and his whole posture changes the second he is worried he's done something wrong, but once he knows you mean no harm he is as sweet and friendly as they come. This gorgeous big boy will make a wonderful family dog.\n\nVisit Mozart at www.hua.org!",

You save the life of the dog that you foster for us, and also the life of the next dog that fills the space where our dog was. Our primary goal is to find fur-ever homes for as many Malamutes as possible.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please email MalRescueDE@gmail.com for an application.  Once your application is processed, a home visit is required.  There is an adoption fee of  $250 for each adult dog. Our dogs  are healthy, spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, and heartworm negative. \n\nUnfortunately rescues don't have the ability to hold dogs for adopters.  Dogs are adopted to approved adopters on a first come, first serve basis. Our goal is to get a dog adopted to a forever home so that we can then help another one. If you are interested in one of our dogs, the first step is to request an application, which is typically sent to you the same day you have emailed your request. We process your application the day it is received. The next step is a home visit, and then you will be invited to meet the dogs. While we represent the State of Delaware, AMROD\u2019s dogs are fostered in  west-central  Virginia.  Contact  preference  is  by  email,  malrescuede@gmail.com,  rather  than  by  phone.  We  appreciate  you  considering  an  AMROD  dog!",

Her ideal family would be active as she does have a lot of energy to burn being only approx 2 years old. We think she would make a great running companion and side kick for an active adult or teenager. \nTulsa is fixed, vaccinated fully, microchipped and heartworm negative. \nHer adoption fee is $250 through Astasia's Angel Animal Rescue\n",

I approach everyone with caution until I know you are safe then I snuggle right up to you and I mean REALLY snuggle! I was found in the very early am hours on the side of the road emaciated and very injured pads on all 4 feet. I took time to heal but while doing so I learned that humans can be very tender and sweet. My shy side still shows up sometimes but overall I am completely adjusted to this new life! I have learned how to overcome many fears such as hardwood floors and louder noises. I still bark at the thunder though. I like other dogs and all people. Little ones makes me nervous so I prefer a home without super young kids. I also am not good with feline friends. \nI have been fully vetted! Neutered, microchipped, heartworm and Lyme tested, wormed and now ready for a forever home!!!\nMy adoption fee is $150. Please complete our adoption application on our website. \nHope-rescue.org",

We took her from the Orange County Shelter about four years ago where she was about to be killed for biting one of the shelter workers.  But we always have to give them a break when they are in such a scary place like a county shelter.  So Abbie came to live with us here at the rescue.  It turns out, she had some early onset arthritis, which may explain her tendency to lash out when she is touched in a sensitive area.  We are looking for a family for Abbie who will understand her limitations.  She does not like to be touched, and will always let us know when she has had enough on her walks. She would like a home with no children or other pets.  She will require a home with a special kind of person who will respect her space when she asks for it.  Abbie has lived in a kennel most of her life, so if you are a patient person who can give Abbie a home of her own, please come meet her1\n",

He sure has a lot of pep for a guy that age and Doc seems to think he is more like 14 to 15. Poor guy is blind and has been for some time I gather. I was told once he lost his sight he started having accidents in the house and he was put outside in a crate in a field of tall grasses :( Well no more of that nonsense for this ole cutie....I mean come on, just look at that face. Spike still has a lot of love to give and trusts quickly and seems to do great with all the dogs here and love attention of people too. He also learned his territory here very quickly with a little help and follows my voice when we need to go outside. He even finds his way into an open crate for a nap on an occasion. Spike is now up to date on his vaccines, heart worm and lymes negative, neutered and micro chipped. We also tested negative for glaucoma. He is ready and that was and looking for his new forever family. Emails us for an application at mmadoptions@gmail.com",

She is around 4 yrs old, spayed, heartworm negative and on prevention. \n\nDaisy loves to go ride and will sit shotgun any chance she gets. She's absolutely house trained and holds it for a long time when necessary. She LOVES all people and is crate trained. In fact she lays in it often without being told. and when she needs to be in it, all I say is \"crate\" and point and she walks right in and plops right down. \n\nDaisy doesn't like all dogs but when she needs to be the only pet. While she loves to go for a walk and does well on a leash, she's also a lazy girl and is happy to just lay around in the same room as her people. She also LOVES toys and will toss it up and keep herself entertained for quite a while. She is a very charming girl with lots of cute and entertaining characteristics. She makes us laugh often with her silly antics. She weighs around 60 lbs, but as you can see she could stand to loose a bit (we love her though)!  Daisy has a high prey drive and will need a fenced in yard.  Due to her size lack of manners (jumping) she will need to go to a family with older children.  (10+)\n\nAdoption fee is $175 and includes: spay/neuter, parvo/distemper series of shots, rabies (if dog is old enough), bordatella, heartworm preventative while here, worming, and microchip.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting one of our dogs, please visit our website and fill out an application: NorthMeckAnimalRescue.org",

He spent time with our trainer and some time in boarding until we could get him into one of our homes to be evaluated before getting him into his forever home. \n\nCash is 6 years old and is a stubborn boy! When he wants something, he will let you know! When he doesn\u2019t want to move, he won\u2019t! But we are making progress! He listens very well and is highly treat-motivated. He just wants to have a comfortable life with lots of attention.\n\nCash should be an only dog with no children, a single person would be best. With Cash, you must establish and maintain your dominance or he will know and start to test you. A single owner would probably be best so he knows you are in control. \n\nHe has claimed the chair as \u201chis\u201d and 99% of the time, I will find him chilling on it. He is not high energy at all. We will require an experienced adopter since he is so stubborn so if you love his sweet face, send us an email and we can chat about Cash. \n\nLet\u2019s get this handsome devil into his forever home soon!",

She used to get along well with other dogs in her old neighborhood, but has been at the Rescue a long time and is now very aggressive to other dogs. She adores people, especially children. She was adopted for a few weeks and used to put the children to bed and make sure they were tucked in.\n\nShe walks great on a leash, but other dogs must be avoided. She has had such a sad life, but is still a cheerful dog and would make a great companion in a home where no other dogs visit, with a secure fenced yard. UPDATE: Betty has a Guardian Angel who has sponsored her adoption fee in hopes it would encourage a nice person to take a second look at Betty. She is also in foster care as of 01/02/2021. \n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 1 year) are $175.00, dogs (over 1 year) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks.\n\nKoi and Saxon are best friends seeking a home together. Koi is a very sweet girl! She has a very tender heart towards those she loves and gets excited to see you with Akita zoomies and bouncing!! Her best buddy Saxon is a large Akita male with whom she wrestles and plays with all day long. Both Koi and Saxon are very true to the breed, they need a little time to get to know you and trust you but once they do, they fall deeply in love and give you their devoted loyalty and affection. Both should not be with small children and because of their distrust of strangers should be introduced properly to new people. Saxon is a handsome boy Akita that is calm, loyal, strong, confident and kind. Both Koi and Saxon are ranch/volunteer favorites because of their wonderful hearts and loyal devotion. They would do best with positive leadership in an Akita experienced home. Koi and Saxon are everything an Akita lover would want of a devoted pair.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Lynn & Cedric (lynnwelcomesyouhome@gmail.com) for more information about this pet. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Meet Sugar :) She is an absolutely beautiful little girl who got dumped in a kill shelter when her owner died. She was rescued shaking and cowering in the corner of her cage in the big scary shelter. She is proving to be a wonderful companion in her foster home and wiggles her whole rear end when spoken to and rolls over for belly rubs. She is medium to low energy, preferring to just sit with the humans and be petted or follow you around on your chores. She is also up for a game of fetch now and then and loves to chew on nyla bones. Sugar tends to try to be queen of the castle and would do best as an only dog or with a larger dog (25lbs and over) who would not put up with her bossiness. She will play with other freindly dogs. She is spayed and microchipped and has had all her vaccinations. Fill out an application now if you think Sugar would be a good fit in your home. She is a wonderful little lady and deserves a great forever home!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

Because of this she is going to be perfect for an all female or single lady home.  She has a fear of men but can get used to 1 nice, patient, soft spoken man who is willing to teach her to trust him.  Dulce is now almost 5 yrs old and about 10lbs, the girl loves food and her foster mom has given her such good food over the years.  She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and ready for that perfect person who can help her live a long blissful life lounging in the sun, taking beach walks or road trips.  If she sounds like your kind of dog complete one of our apps: www.gonetothedogsrescue.org/adoption-application",

He is fully vaccinated and neutered, and has no health concerns with the exception of issues with ear infections.\n\nPacino had a rough start in life & takes significant time to warm up to new people, if he is willing to engage, as he displays visible fear of new surroundings.  Pacino becomes afraid around other dogs & would prefer to be the only pet in his forever home to ensure he can consistently do as well as possible. In his home, he allows all handling from his foster mom & will sometimes open up periodically to new people before becoming afraid & unsure.  Pacino has learned commands & general training in his foster home & loves receiving his treats when he does well.  He loves to run & play outside & chews his toys with no issues as long as he feels safe.  He is also crate trained & sleeps in there each night.  Ideally, he is seeking a place with someone experienced with difficult &/or abused dogs/breeds & is equipped with the time, space & resources to work him through struggles. A trainer, animal health professional, behaviorist, someone involved in rehabilitation, etc. is Pacino's best chance at a successful & safe adoption, & he is waiting for that person to find him here.\n\nPacino is available for adoption through Pit of Our Souls Rescue!",

Harrison doesn't understand his own strength/size, so would probably do best in a home with older children. Harrison's adoption fee is $175.

He is VERY active and plays hard all day then crashes at bedtime.\nPetey does well with some other small dogs, but he can be dominant with others.  \n\nPetey has a major issue with being yelled at by humans.  If you yell at him and/or wag your finger in his face he will bite you.  For this reason we will not place him into a home with children.\nHe is mostly housetrained, but can lift his leg to mark where another male dog has been from time to time.\nPetey's adoption fee is $350.",

            "description": "This beauty is Barkley, and we are hoping that the perfect forever home is out there for this sweet girl. She is a special gal who has a few quirks, but lets face it...dont we all?! Barkley is 4 years old, and we are told is a lab/boxer mix, but its possible she may have some pit in her as well. She does well with all dogs that are around her size or larger. She hasnt lived with cats, but she has been a little too interested in the cats she has come into contact with...so we are recommending a cat-free home. Barkleys ideal home would be a calm household on a quiet street with minimal visitors and a fenced-in yard. She tends to get nervous when meeting new people, and her forever family will need to understand that shell need some time and a safe space (her crate) to allow her to warm up and be more comfortable. Once she is bonded with her people she also tends to be a bit protective of them, so may need to be crated if new people visit her home. Barkleys foster mom says once she is comfortable with people, she is so very sweet, goofy, cuddly, and lovable! She loves bones, playing ball, and her stuffed toys. She is crate-trained, keeps a very clean kennel, and is fully house-trained. She also loves playing and snuggling with her 4-legged foster siblings, so Barkley would love another dog in her forever home to both learn from and bond with. She also loves going for walks, but does need consistency and continued training when on-leash as she does get stressed and vocal when meeting other dogs/people when leashed. Having some yummy treats along on her walks definitely helps! She will need an experienced owner with an abundance of patience and grace. We are also recommending no young children in the home (kids ages 15+ would be best). We know that her perfect home is out there...and we would appreciate you sharing her gorgeous face so that we can all help Barkley find her forever! \n\n**If you have any questions about Barkley, please feel free to reach out to us! Her adoption fee includes her spay, vaccines, heartworm test, and microchip.",

All love and loyalty, Pel may be a bit large at nearly 80 pounds to be a lap dog but it doesn't mean he won't put his head in your lap to beg for some good petting. He was born in September of 2015 and though he has experienced some negative treatment in the past, he loves to be with people who are kind to him. He wants to be loved and is eager to show his own affection. He is easy to bathe, rides well in the car, (even if he wants his head in your lap there, too), and walks enthusiastically on a leash. He loves to go with you so taking him along for a walk is enjoyable. Pel is a real star and is ready to be the champ in your world. Welcome him into your home...and your heart!",

She is great with kids and other dogs Once Properly Introduce.\n\nAs Mabel was originally pulled from a shelter in Louisiana to become a PTSD service dog for veterans, and it was found that Mabel had an abundance of energy that exceeded recommended levels for PTSD dogs, so she found herself with our group. We will foster her for a time and try to find her a home. She is being fostered in a home with a Diabetic Alert Dog and the Foster Dad suffers from severe hypoglycemia (low Blood Sugar). While she is here she sees all that is going on and has the opportunity learn and voluntarily step up and show she understands by alerting. But as yet has not showed interest in alerting!",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nKipp is a sweet, quiet, but just a tad nervous with new people kind of boy.  He needs some reassurance and time to adjust but will be a great addition to a settled, gentle adult home.  He is pretty much a one-person fellow, so a single adult would be the best situation for him.  He will be totally devoted to his person.  Kipp's birthday is 8/09/2015, and on 2/05/.2020 he weighed 24.5 pounds.  His adoption fee is $200.\n\nTo request an adoption application, please email info@route66rescueinc.org .

We need to safely do home visits, meet and greet, and Adoptions. Please be patient as we can do the Pre-Checks but may need more time to complete the Adoption process.\n\n8/20/20- Gunner had his Annual exam, shots, and ProHeart 6 for 6 months heartworm prevention. Vet wants him to not get over 60 lbs..He is doing great and bloodwork is excellent. He just needs his Forever Home!\n\nGUNNER- Happy 5th Birthday Gunner (estimated dob 8/16/15) We rescued him 2 years ago. He came to us heartworm positive with an old injury of a broken hip. He went through heartworm treatment, had xrays, and exam with Orthopedic Vet. He does have separation anxiety and doesn't like to be alone. He has to be crated in a secure plastic crate when you are not home.  He has had several homes in his life and we want the best for him. We love Gunner and we have not found the right Forever Home. Please read all about him. \n\nHe is a total sweetheart!! Everyone who meets him loves him. He is full of love, nosey like a Boxer, and a STRONG high energy Boxer, who wants all of your attention. He is very social and loves playing and going for walks with his Foster Dad. He needs a home where his family is not gone a lot. He loves his Foster Mom who works from home. He would rather be doing something and not just laying on the couch. He will snuggle with his humans and other dogs, cats and older kids when resting. He has to have another dog in his home. He is great with other medium to large dogs that are not dominant, as he wants to be the leader of the pack. He doesn't like small dogs. He will plow through all the dogs to get to his Foster family so not good if you have a jealous dog. He is good with cats in his Foster Home. He lets them lay next to him and rub against him. He will chase them if they are running and think he just wants to play. Kids need to be 10 yrs and older and experienced with large dogs, as he doesn't know his size and strength. He gets so excited and will jump up on kids and adults just for love. Best with a Boxer experienced family. He needs an active family that has the time and is going to do things with him. He has been many times to PetsMart for training and very smart, just needs Adopter to be in charge. BTW he is a big strong drooler/slobberer with those jowls, so have a towel ready! \n\nGunner can walk, run, jump, jump up on things, and gets around great! He has a few restrictions with his old injury of broken hip most likely causing from being hit by a car. He is on daily Rimadyl and this summer with the heat/humidity his hip has been bothering him. He has needed more Rimadyl and not able to go on his daily walks which he loves. He also takes Glucosamine  Adopter needs to be able to watch for signs that he is having issues and adjust meds and exercise. His Vet and Orthopedic Vet have recommended no surgery. He has to get exercise to keep his back right hip muscles in good shape. He needs to maintain his current weight and not gain weight to put more pressure on his hips/back. \n\nAdoption fee at 5 years old is $225. He is neutered, shots, rabies, microchipped, fecal/heartworm negative and on heartworm prevention. At least a 6 ft+ privacy fenced in yard is required for Gunner. He is to be an indoor dog. Go to www.BoxerRescueOfTexarkana.com to How to Adopt for our Requirements and online Adoption Application. \n\nWe adopt in AR, TX, LA and OK in areas where we have support. Please let us know if you are out of this area to see if we could consider your area.\n\n",

I am three years old and a good guy. I am sleek, handsome, very playful and love to swim (baby pools so far). I also passed my cat test at the shelter so should do well with them. I do prefer to be your only dog though. All I ask is that you request to meet me in a yard and PLEASE don't judge me by my manners at my dog door. I'm competing with everyone else for a chance to get adopted. It would mean the world to me if you would consider me for your new best friend. Love, Code\nTerre Haute Humane Society. THHS.org email: adopt@thhs.org\nADOPTION INCLUDES: Spay or Neuter,Worming,Vaccinations (excluding rabies),Microchip,Free Vet visit at Participating Offices,30 Days of Health Insurance provided by PetHealth (some restrictions apply)\nAdoption Fees may vary, but our standard fees are: Cats $85 and Dogs $125.

I was a hunting dog who didn't want to hunt, and I am feral. I will warm up to humans over time to some degree, but don't really like when they touch me, sometimes I will allow it IF you earn my trust... I LOVE to play with other dogs as long as they're bigger than me (I do NOT like smaller dogs, or even my own size...ONLY bigger ones), and only IF I decide they're worthy of my friendship. A home with NO kids, another dog (of my choosing), and a yard with 6 foot fence is an ABSOLUTE MUST for me. I also like sitting in \"my\" yard chair and on plastic yard toys (slides, etc). If you're a very patient person with all of my requirements and would like to possibly give me a forever home, CALL (757) 432-9222. ONLY those who CALL will be considered.",

He is about 2.5 yrs old and weighs approx 85 lbs. He is a \u2018low rider\u2019 ... a massive body on short stout legs! \nRover is a fun loving, happy and playful pup! He has a very sweet disposition and wants to please you. \nHe loves to run and play fetch as well as cuddle in your lap. He is a great hugger too! \nRover is crate trained and housetrained. He still has a lot of 'puppyness' to him though, so you will need to stay on top of his antics! \nHe likes to play with his kong toys and will keep busy chewing on Benebones. His foster Mom is working on his leash skills, and he is getting better but will need ongoing leash work.. He is a very strong boy! \nRover would do best with an interactive family that will include him in activities and have him be a real part of the family. He is a large, solid dog that is a bit clumsy, and can be a 'bull in the china closet' so he could knock over young children and/or toddlers accidentally...for this reason he is only available to homes with no young children. (under 12 yrs of age)\nHe loves to play with doggie friends but should be in a home with NO OTHER DOGS OR CATS. He has a very rough play style so small dogs can easily get hurt and big dogs need to be submissive, passive and able to handle rough play due to his size and strength. \nRover is a big squishy love bug that will be a great family dog for an experienced bully breed owner.\nHe has puppy playful energy so he will need daily exercise or will get bored and develop bad habits.....his clumsy antics will keep you smiling! He has a big heart and lots of love to give.\n\n**HOME OWNERSHIP AND BULLY BREED EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THIS DOG**\n\nADOPTION FEE IS $300 which includes health exam, spay, current vaccinations, micro chip, flea and worming treatment, along with any other medical or dental deemed necessary by our veterinarian. \n",

Gary can be both friendly and affectionate, and yet sometime unfocused and disinterested in what the human end of the leash is asking him to do.  He pulls on leash, he jumps up, he can be gently mouthy but he does know how to sit on cue.  He is a big dork and he probably has had very little structure and expectations placed on him.  He doesn't have a great respect of boundaries, but he means no harm.  He will bark at us for attention when he is in his kennel, but when taken outside, just wants to go where he wants to go.  He met a very playful and friendly female dog and did very well with her.  He presents as a bit of a challenge due to his \"pulling has always worked for me\" behavior, but can definitely learn in the right environment.  We also believe we will see a nice change in focus and behavior once he is neutered!\n\nGary's adoption fee is $150 and includes neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days free pet health insurance, and custom engraved ID tag.",

He is not a big runner and is laid back, but playful. Hendrick is house trained and crate/kennel trained.\n\nHendrick's back story is that he was found tied to a fire hydrant after being used as a bait dog, which is one reason intact dogs with testosterone are a big issue for him.  He is a lucky dog to have been taken in by a local vet office who has loved him back into good health.\n\nHendrick needs an experienced dog owner who will give him exercise, structure, and consistency and be willing to work with him. He is a quick learner, food motivated and quite smart. He would do great as an only pet. He is a very sweet, strong happy boy who would be happy just sitting next to you on the sofa. \n\nHendrick really wants a forever loving home who will give him the love and security he so deserves. If you would like to meet Hendrick  or know more about this wonderful boy, please send us an email at SittingPrettyPetBoarding@gmail.com\n\nThis dog is not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up. If you do not live within a 30-minute drive of Torrance, please do not apply. \nPlease note that we are all volunteers, so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in. Our pets are fostered/boarded in Torrance, CA 90501.",

            "description": "Odie came to ARFF MO as a stray. He is 4 years old. Odie knows how to sit and down on command, catch treats, and shake hands with you. Odie was never socialized with other dogs and he needs help with initial introductions by his handler. He is a quick learner though and is very \"treat motivated\". Odie is a bit predatory with cats so he would need a home without them. He is also much too energetic to live with a small dog. Odie is crate trained and house trained. He loves to play with toys.Odie requires his adopter to own their own home and to have a fenced yard. Odie is a sweetheart of a dog that does like to snuggle. He is a very handsome guy. He is too energetic for small children. If you think you'd be a good home for an engertic boy like Odie please complete an adoption application on our website (www.arffmo.org). Adoption Fee: $125.00 for adult dogs over 6 months of age, and a home visit is required before final approval. 1/18/21 3:10 PM",

He is full of energy but not insanely wound up, he longs and craves to play with people and (some) other dogs.  He can come on just a little strong to some other dogs when he is trying to play, he just hasn't learned all the nuances of \"p-etiquette\" yet, but he has always shown that he is just trying to be overly friendly.  He would enjoy being the only dog in a house, but he would probably get along fine with another female who had a laid-back temperament.  Either way, he is just a fantastic boy who needs a home that will make him part of their family - one that will treasure and value him for the loyal, full-of-love companion that he is.  Jesse would love to have a BIG fenced-in yard to play in, but he does not need to be relegated to living only outdoors.",

My owners never had any time for me and left me alone all the time.  They brought me back to Halfway to Home so I can find a loving, active family who wants me to be part of their life and give me lots of love, good-quality human companionship, playtime, exercise and training. I have lots of energy and would probably be a good running or hiking partner for the right person.  I also love water as you can see from my photos!. I am a little shy around strangers. but once I get to know I warm up quickly and I have never been aggressive. To help me bond with you and understand how to be the pet you expect, I would enjoy getting some obedience training.  I have lived happily at the rescue with another large male dog, so  I will probably do well with other large male dogs, but not females or small dogs. I know I will make an amazingly loyal canine companion.  Please consider making me part of the family.  For more information about me, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).\n\nAt the rescue Baylee is housed with Duck and they are walked together.",

He lives with his four foster siblings (three chihuahuas and a German shepherd) and loves to play!  He likes to jog with his foster dad and would be a great running buddy.He enjoys playing fetch and  is also great at cuddling on the sofa.  He loves to sit in your lap, gives hugs and kisses.\u201d\n\nMore about him from his foster: He is Moderately active, Leash trained, Crate trained, Does well in a car, Likes toys, Playful, Affectionate, obedient and goofy. Best with Older/considerate kids. Not a fan of kitties\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nMeet Marcel\nMarcel had spent his time as a puppy chained in the backyard.  He was found by a Streetdog Volunteer who dutifully contacted owner information on his tags and returned him.  Less than 1 week later, he was found over 7 miles away from his home by someone else, exhausted and hungry.  This time, his owners did not return any calls about their found dog.  So now Marcel is officially a Streetdog and loving every minute of it.  \n\nMarcel prefers dogs that are smaller than him and needs a day or so to warm up to new pup friends. He would prefer a home with older children because of his large size.\n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

            "description": "Barbarossa came to his foster mama with his dog mom and brothers.  The brothers have both been adopted, but Barbarossa is still looking for his fur-ever home.  He is young, about a year old, and even though he weighs about 50 pounds, he is characterized as large due to his height.  Before being rescued Barbarossa had no experience being around people, and he is still very shy.  He is curious and learns quickly, but he needs constant reassurance and direction from his foster mama.  He will need a special human who has lots of time and patience to spend with Barbarossa and who also knows how to be a confident pack leader.  His foster mama feels that he would do better in an adult-only household.  Barbarossa is safe around children, but their quick, sudden movements scare him, and he runs and hides from them.  Barbarossa is crate-trained and learns quickly, but he does need practice with walking on a leash without pulling and other doggie manners.  He has the potential to be a wonderful addition to a home.  He just needs the patience and understanding of a special human who is willing to spend the time building trust with him.\n\nEmail: shortylittle@comcast.net  \nPhone number 717 645 2511\n\nPlease contact me through text or email during the day.

It became obvious very quickly that Lil' Bit had not spent much time around people before she was rescued.  Unlike other dogs that rush over to you and beg for attention, Lil' Bit is hesitant.  She will wait and watch you first, and then she will come over to sniff you.  Do not let this count her out as a dog-candidate for your family.  She is friendly, sweet, and wants affection.  It just takes her a little time to warm up to strangers.  Her foster mama feels that she would do better in an adult-only household.

A large backyard would do the trick, this guy is well trained and will play all day if you let him. Buddy has yet to meet a human he doesn't love but because of his size would do best with adults only. Buddy does have a restricted adoption that we will consult with you during the time of adoption.

He loves playing tug with you or another pup or running and walking in his wheelchair. All you have to do is say, \"do you want to...\" and he is at the gate waiting to be leashed up. \n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application. We do adopt out of state and will arrange transports. Our dogs are not allowed to fly cargo at any time.",

            "description": "Meet Buddy, a four-year-old and 120-pound puppy! He has had a few different homes and is looking for an experienced dog owner with large dog experience. \n\nBuddy can be a big goofball and he has a heart of gold. He knows many tricks that he is happy to show off, including resisting yummy treats until you tell him he can eat it! He uses his big voice to say \"Hello\" to new people and is very protective of his people. Buddy will need a patient person who understands he needs to be introduced to new people slowly and with positive reinforcement. He is picky about who he likes so a potential adopter will need to bring the whole family to meet him and should be prepared to do multiple visits as going really slow with introductions is very important for him and for you. Buddy does not like kids and will need an adult-only home without cats.\n\nBuddy has separation anxiety and can be destructive when left alone so he would prefer a family where someone is around most of the time. When left alone he will need to be crated until he gets used to a new routine and may still need to be crated after this. \n\nBuddy is not a dog that can be off-leash. He is reactive to new people, kids, wildlife, and barking dogs, so for his safety, he needs to either be on a leash or in a tall fenced yard. He is energetic and will need someone who can play with him and burn some of his energy off each day. Buddy needs someone who lives in a single-family residence without cats and has enough room out back to exercise him. Buddy has been improving on his socialization but may never get to a point where he can walk in public. He is not a dog for someone who wants to bring him around town, to social gatherings, or on public hiking trails. \n\nWhen it comes to other dogs, with a proper introduction, he loves to play and wrestle. He is best friends with Jayne (who is also his mother and needs a home too) and has been able to play with some of the other shelter dogs. Buddy will need to meet any dogs in the household before adoption though to make sure both dogs get along.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this charming boy, please start by filling out an adoption application that can be found on our website at trilakeshumanesociety.org or give us a call at 518-891-0017 if you would like a hard copy mailed to you. Once we have an approved adoption application we can set up an appointment for you to come in and meet Buddy, spend some time with him, and see if he is a good fit for you and your household.\n",

He does well on a leash and is crate-trained, which should make the transition to house-breaking relatively easy.  Due to Chuck's strong prey drive, he needs an experienced dog owner and a home without children.  If you are looking for a companion to spend lazy days together, Chuck would be the ideal match for your life.\n\nEmail: shortylittle@comcast.net  \nPhone number 717 645 2511\n\nPlease contact me through text or email during the day.

He would love a chance at a really great home to call his own,  loves car rides and snuggling in his beds and blankets.  Quiet and happy, he now enjoys his new friends and lying in the sun.",

Richie and Lucille were born in April 2018, probably siblings and definitely bonded. so at this time we are asking that they be adopted together. They came into rescue with demodex mange, and after treatment, they are doing great in their foster home, but they would really love a home to call their very own. They are crate trained and house-trained. They have suffered so much neglect in their lives already and as a result are very shy and timid in new situations. They are completely comfortable in their foster home now with the family that they know but new people can be a little scary for them still. Who can blame them after all they have been through?! We need to find a perfect forever home for them filled with patience and understanding while this amazing pair learns that not all humans are bad. Richie is the brown dog, and Lucille is the black dog. If you are interested in adopting Richie and Lucille, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "Lola\nBreed: Pit Bull\nGender: Female\nAge: 1 year old\nSize: Medium\nWhere you can find me: At WAG\n\n \n\nEnergy Level: Medium\nTraining Goals: To work one on one with her & a trainer to help overcome fears & anxieties\nHouse trained? Yes\nKids? No\nCats? No\nDogs? No\nMedical Needs: I have had a very unstable past, to help me cope with my fears I am on anti-anxiety medication!\n\nAbout Me:\nHi, I'm Lola!\n\nI am a very special girl who is looking for an experienced dog owner who I can love forever.  I need someone who is willing to work with a trainer and myself to work on getting over some of my fears. I have an unstable past and staff believe I was abused and neglected. When I meet new people my first instinct is to lunge and bark as I am quite fearful. Once I get to know and trust you I want nothing more than to sit on your lap - I am the biggest cuddle bug! \n\nWhen I first came to WAG, staff believe I didn't have much experience going for walks as I was mostly tied up in a yard. I would lunge and bark at every car and person I saw. Staff have been doing lots of training with me, and now I am only lunging when I see really scary vehicles like buses and trucks! I love going on walks in quiet areas, and my favourite thing is playing in water! I love streams, lakes, rivers and pools! I could splash around all day if you let me!\n\nAlthough I do love a good walk, I can also be a huge cuddly couch potato, movies and snacks anyone? I'm your girl! I would be quite content running around a big yard and then snuggling the rest of the day away on a comfy couch! \n\n I am quite fearful of men so I\u2019d prefer to go to a home with a rad chick, or maybe 2 rad chicks! I\u2019m not opposed to meeting a man, it just might take a few hangouts until I learn to trust you. Staff are working on my training every day and I have already shown so much progress! \n\nI will thrive in a calm, nurturing environment with people that will pay attention to any signs of anxiety I may show. I would love to live in a quiet area  - an apartment in a busy city is not for me! My favourites place to be is sitting on your lap or right next to you, giving you lots of hugs! I really am a loving and goofy girl, and WAG staff know that whoever adopts me will have the most affectionate and fun companion!\n\nI need a home that is committed to me and ready to give me a life with love and adventure for the rest of my years. I am looking for a home where I am the number 1 focus and where I am the only animal! I can't wait to find my forever home.\n\nMy Story:\nI have had a very unstable start to my life. I was impounded by the RCMP when my previous caregivers were arrested. They never returned to pick me up and I was left at WAG. It is believed that I was abused and neglected in my previous home, hence my fearfulness and anxiety. I have never had a stable home life, or proper training, both of which I need in my next home. I am quite sad that I've found myself at a shelter but I have settled into the stable routine well and impressed the staff at how much I have grown in my time here! I can't wait for a family that will commit a lifetime of love to me.",

Bronco loves to be around people, he just does not want to cuddle. He'll rub against you and let you stroke him every now and then. Bronco would do best with someone who's around most of the day. He thrives knowing people are around and even calls \u201cwoo hoo\u201d when he sees a volunteer just to say hello! If you're someone who has a quiet household and is looking for a companion to sit on the porch with or help you in the garden, Bronco would be your faithful sidekick.\n\n \nSpecial Training:\nFree Spirit Siberian Rescue cannot make any guarantee regarding the outcome of any cat testing done. The owner assumes full responsibility for the dog\u2019s behavior and, per the requirement of the adoption contract, will enroll the dog(s) in obedience classes to aid in the process.\n\n If interested in this adorable canine please begin the adoption process by filling out an adoption application.

            "description": "Nikki is a Parsons Terrier that we saved from a shelter along with her puppies.  They found homes, now it is her time.  She is about 7 yrs old and 30 lbs.  She is very timid and does not approach people.  It has taken several months for her foster mom to be able to touch her without her freaking out.  She will fine but it takes time for her to come around to her parents.  She loves the other dogs, she loves the water, and she really does have a sweet disposition.  It just takes time.  She loves belly rubs too!  She will sleep in bed with her foster mom and will not let mom scratch and love on her, although that has been improving.   She is a work in progress, but will be worth the work.  Her adoption fee is $50",

Dakota is treat and praise motivated and knows the following commands: Lets Go, Wait, Sit, Down, Off, Leave It, Watch, and Touch. \n\nHe is young and energetic, so a home with an active family or owner who will take him on runs/walks/hikes would be ideal. Dakota calms downs and enjoys his down time once he has had some exercise and just wants you to pet and spend time with him.\n\nDakota has a high jump and can climb a fence so he needs to be leashed and supervised when in the yard.\n\nHis favorite things to do include walks, car rides, playing (he loves tennis balls, kongs and rope toys) and chilling out on his bed and blanket. Favorite foods are carrots, peanut butter, cheese and chicken. His most favorite thing of all-Spending time with you!\n\n\nEmail: petsandvetsusa@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you are interested in learning about this integrative approach to care, feel free to call, but be prepared to hear the difference between conventional and holistic care.\n\nWe ONLY accept phone call enquiries, written enquiries, messages or emails, will not be responded to. You MUST call us prior to filling out an adoption application after reading the requirements for adoption. Tel: 508-533-8251  8am-8pm ONLY. We cannot adopt to homes with children under 13 years old and you must be able to provide a previous Vet reference of care of a previous dog in the potential adopters names under 3 years ago. If you have not owned a dog before we would not be able to move forward. Please only leave ONE message.\nWe believe in a more holistic approach for care of these small dogs, that can live into their 20's if cared for naturally. Therefore we insist on an integrative approach to vet care ongoing, so please make sure you learn about this approach before contacting us. Copy and paste this link to read and learn about integrative medicine, BEFORE contacting us. Thank you.\n'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/discovering-integrative-v_b_599944/amp'\n\nMaggie is 4 years old, 12lbs and a sweet, happy and super smart energetic Poodle. We are looking for a family that will exercise her on a daily basis. Maggie deserves a great family that will love her and in return she will love them to full capacity, with kisses and hugs. Maggie also has a GREAT nose and would be a fantastic scent dog, for competition or work related. Maggie would chase a cat to play with it, so it would not be a good match. Maggie would only do well with an equal size and high energy level dog, as she wants to play. She would be great as an only dogs as well.\n\nRequirements for adoption:\nFenced in yard without exception (physical fence for running off leash, attended) No electric fences.\nSomeone who loves to walk.\nSomeone home some or all of the day (no home for lunch situations or dog walkers or daycare)\nMUST be prepared to take an integrative approach to vet care and nutrition. (Holistic and conventional care combined and minimal vaccines)\nOther same size dog, but NO cats\n \nWe prefer contact by phone for enquiries: Tel: 508-533-8251 read adoption directions below.\nALL of our dogs are in private foster homes in Massachusetts, you will meet the dog after completing an adoption application and we arrange a home visit and bring the dog with us.\n\nWe are in Massachusetts and only adopt to a 75 mile radius of Dover, MA.. \nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, dental cleanings if needed, Micro chipped and go home with their history folder, new harness, leash, collar and the food they are being fed.\n\nPoodles need to go to a professional groomer every 6-8 weeks at a cost of about $65, so please factor that into the costs associated with dog ownership.  To apply to adopt one of our Poodles, go to our website,\nhttp://toypoodlerescue.net Toy Poodle Rescue \nand fill out our Adoption Application.  If you require more information please call 508-533-8251 All calls and applications will receive a response.

He has been in kennel free boarding for too long because his foster was no longer foster and his original rescuer is no longer rescuing. A forever foster (but even better - an adopter) with large-breed experience is Hero's dream! We supply food, crate and other necessary items for our fosters & cover vetting at our vets. Hero came to us from Riverside Shelter where he was on the euthanasia list for his age. They also noted he had trouble walking. We expected to pick up a weak old guy with hip issues, but instead we picked up a young-at-heart guy who thinks he's still a young Buck! :) He has spent several months with our trainer who was amazed at his energy level. The only way you can tell his age - his beautiful grey mask and worn, rough pads on his backside. :( Other than that, he has no idea he's a mature gentleman. We are not sure of his breed but Shepherd/Boxer/Pointer/Pitbull have all been guessed as possible mixes. He is a beautiful, shiny, dark-chocolate brindle. He does best with submissive dogs. We don't know how he is with cats. Because he is strong and can be a bit nervous in new situations, we recommend a home with no kids. Can you give an old guy the home or forever-foster he so deserves?\nEmail cause4sbpaws@gmail.com or apply now: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/forms/form?formid=3251",

Some dogs teach us what inner strength and courage are all about. Some dogs just want to play and stay in the moment, one sniff of fresh air, one listening to the sounds of people laughing, birds chirping, wind blowing. Martin just wants to enjoy his life. Saved by Rescue Ridge from a local, overcrowded, inner city shelter, Martin awaits your love and his forever home in a foster home. He loves people! Martin is very smart and alert. He enjoys\ncompany\n. He is dog-friendly with dogs who understand that, because he is visually impaired, he doesn't always understand social cues and is a bit clumsy. Martin is best in a home with older children because he probably can only see shadows. This impairment doesn't stop him from enjoying running around the play yard at his foster home or snuggling on the couch by your side. He is affectionate and very sweet. If you put a treat in front of his face, he will try his best to take it gently but does not always succeed. He can't help it. He tries. Martin is housebroken. He needs a fenced in yard and needs supervision in the yard because he will follow a scent and can escape. He is a wonderful boy, around 5 yrs. old.\nWill\nyou take him home and show him that his life matters? Please apply to adopt Martin in central N. J. at Rescue Ridge at rescueridge.com and text 732 546 8805 to meet him. Here is Martin's video debut\nhttps://youtu.be/GJOkvYeHdmM",

In his foster home, George has transformed from an originally shy guy to a personable puppy who wags a friendly hello to both people and other dogs.  He delights in playtime and can hardly get enough but, once de-energized, he\u2019s big into cuddle time.  Like every pup, George likes to chew on things and he will pull on the leash during walks, but his very experienced foster dad has the patience required to train this boy into a mannerly gentleman.  George barks only when it is warranted and is housebroken as long as he has access to the outside.  He would love another dog to play with in his forever home.  Let us know if you\u2019re interested in meeting our Gorgeous George!\n\nWestside dog biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "This handsome 4yr old  boy is Duke. He is a playful, strong boy who has lots of energy to burn. Duke would love to be your sidekick, whether it be riding in the car, taking hikes, or some sort of family adventure. Duke can be dog selective, so a home as the only pet perhaps. Duke would do best with older kids and gets overly excited with a lot of traffic and commotion. Duke's new pet parent will need to be an experienced dog owner with patience while he adjust to his new surroundings. He is a little aloof at first, but once he is done exploring, he will be ready for attention and would love to sit in your lap if you let him. (But we don't recommend it for this big boy). \n\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please contact the shelter via email, or phone, or stop by for a visit.\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 procedures, PetSmart and OCHS have had to cancel Saturday adoption events, until restrictions have been lifted. If you are interested in an animal, fill out an application at ochumane.org. A shelter staff member will contact you, to set up an appointment to meet one of our animals at the shelter.",

I was found on the streets, picked up by animal control, and eventually pulled into my foster home.  Upon arrival, my foster family thought I might have a vision issue.  An ophthalmologist diagnosed me with retinal dysplasia that they suspect I was born with.  I have some limited vision but it doesn't stop me from doing anything in my foster home!  I love my foster brother and sisters.  I do very well in the house and yard so much that it is hard for my foster mom to remember that sometimes I might have trouble seeing when it is dusk or dark.   My foster mom says that I am a sweet, sweet girl who deserves my very own family!  I am house trained and crate trained. I love my toys but also just like hanging out with everyone.  I am almost 3 years old, full grown, and weigh 55 lbs. Please don't pass up an opportunity to meet me!\n\nTo start the adoption process, email us at happilyeverafter4dogs@yahoo.com requesting an application. This does not commit you in any way, but helps us make the best match between people and our available dogs.\n\nDOB:07/13/17\nAdoption Fee: $180.00 (Includes microchip registration).\n\nAll of our dogs are required to be INSIDE PETS ONLY. Our adoption process includes an application, check of vet records, interview, neutral site meet & greet with the dog and your family, home visit, and 5 day sleepover.\n",

She is 1 years young American Staffordshire Terrier/Rottweiler/Boxer cross whose interests include cuddling, jumping, exploring, running, romping and chewing. She loves having toys to play with, so her new home will need to provide her with her own toys, bones, playtime, and some training to keep her mind and body healthy. She loves water play and tug o war games. This sweet girl is almost leashed trained, has some basic commands down, she gets along well with people and most dogs. She likes to sleep with her human.\n\nShe has a mild prey drive and is curious about cats so she will need more practice with this. Belle likes to cuddle with you or lay down with you, wherever you may be or whatever you may be doing. She is a sweet and curious dog who wants to explore the world. She is young and willful which means she will need a strong leader.\n\nBelle will be happiest when she can be a part of her person's daily activities. Her family will need to be sure that Belle feels like she is part of a close-knit group. She will need to be spayed, micro chipped, vaccinations complete, licensed in August and has a complete health workup. Miss Belle is still growing her fur on her body from the neglect she was rescued from and some physical scars may still remain from her abuse. Especially on her chin. Dr seems to think she will grow into some of her scars. We have found lamb, duck and salmon work well for her or many of the limited ingredient foods. She will go home with her new family with all her medical records and DNA test results.\n\nAre you looking to add an energetic, beautiful, active, smart, loving girl to your family? What about a social companion ready for any adventure with you? Come see Miss Belle! She is available for adoption through the Miss Gabriel Foundation.\n\nAdoption fee applies.

            "description": "Hi! My name is Jasmine and I am looking for a family of my own to create memories with. I was hoping you would take some time to get to know me and see if we could be the perfect match! I am a shy and affectionate 2-year old American Staffordshire Terrier/Rottweiler mix. I have my basic commands down and I am eager to please. My favorite activities include tug-o-war, water games, and cuddling in bed. \n\nYou might be wondering how I came to live with my foster family at the Miss Gabriel Foundation. It all started when I was just eight weeks old. My seven siblings and I were rescued from a hoarding situation in California and it was essential for us to find a place that could handle our various medical needs. We were all underweight and sick with bacterial infections and needed to be put on antibiotics right away. Our bodies were covered in painful bite wounds and abscess wounds, and I had scars from previous bite marks on my face and underbelly.  \n\nDespite everything I went through, I am a sweet and caring pup who loves spending time with humans. I am a loyal girl who will watch over your every movement. I am very comfortable with women but require a little more patience from men. If you are nice it won\u2019t take me long to warm up to you! I haven\u2019t had much experience with children, but I seem to be afraid of them. \n\nI am a very good girl inside the house and do well when left home alone. However, I take my outside time very seriously and might bark, pace, or scratch at the door when I am ready for some fresh air. Once outside I enjoy the occasional sunbath, but really, it\u2019s a place for me to find exciting new things to add to my collections.   \n\nI tend to be reactive to all types of excitement, especially other animals. If there is wildlife on the other side of the fence, I will let you know it. I\u2019ve never been one to back down from chasing a cat and I\u2019ve heard rumors you should keep them away from me. When I see unfamiliar dogs, my instincts are to stare them down and stiffen my muscles. I will guard my food and toys from other dogs and snap or snarl at them if they appear to want what I have. \n\nUnfortunately, excitement isn\u2019t the best thing for me. I have hip dysplasia and while I am strong, I require a home with a sedentary lifestyle. I shouldn\u2019t go to dog parks, or on long walks or hikes to keep my hips in good shape.  I should be the only dog unless the other dog is elderly and not likely to tempt me into playing rough. I am on daily joint supplements and have a prescription for medication to help when I am showing discomfort. With proper weight management, continued joint supplements, and exercise modifications I can live to be an old lady. \n\nI am allergic to chicken and I'm required to be on a diet with limited or no grain foods while also avoiding beef. I am an otherwise healthy and happy pup who wants nothing more than a family to share my love with. Historically, black dogs, especially black pit bulls, have been hard to adopt. If you think we would make a good match please fill out an application for adoption. I look forward to meeting you!\n\nRescue Video:\nwww.facebook.com/watch/?v=2223849427648797\n\nAdoption Form:\nwww.cognitoforms.com/MissGabrielFoundation/PetAdoptionApplication\n\nEmail Address:\ninfo@missgabriel.org\n\nPhone Number:\n541-582-1521\n\nMailing Address: \nMiss Gabriel Foundation\nP.O.

            "description": "Hello! My name is Eric and I have so much love to give. I was hoping you would take a minute to get to know me and see if we could be best friends! I am a playful 2-year-old American Staffordshire Terrier/Rottweiler/Samoyed mix. I have my basic commands down and I\u2019m eager to please. My favorite activities include cuddling with my human, playing with my squeaky toys, and winning tug-of-war.\n\nBefore you can understand who I am now, we first need to explore my past. When I was just eight weeks old, I was rescued from a hoarding situation in California with my seven sisters. We were underweight and sick and needed to be put on antibiotics right away. My face and underbody were covered in scars that I have since grown into. I was also covered in bite wounds and infections and had a huge abscess on the right side of my face that left my skin a little droopy.\n\nAs a result of my past, I tend to be a little anxious and scared at times. I am friendly, just nervous. When it comes to people, I am good with volunteers but sometimes growl at doctors when I first meet them. I am most comfortable around women, especially older women. I like men too, I just require a little patience before I warm up to them. I feel most comfortable when there are no surprises, so naturally children make me a little nervous. I may growl as they approach since I am unsure of what is going to happen; the older children are the more comfortable I am. \n\nI am a curious pup, but I am also very shy. Strange dogs make me nervous and I will stare them down as my muscles stiffen. My foster family would likely tell you that I seem submissive or scared of other dogs and that it would be best if I was the only dog at first. I\u2019ve heard rumors that some dogs like to cuddle with cats, but that\u2019s not me! I think they look like chew toys and I wouldn\u2019t do well living in a house with one.\n\nI love adventure, especially when it involves water! I also enjoy going for walks, but I do pull strongly on the leash. I get so excited by all the new smells I forget my manners! I always think car rides are a good idea, so I jump right in, but my nerves cause me to pant and whine sometimes making me a little carsick. I am a good boy inside the house and can be left home alone, but I do feel some separation anxiety and have been known to bark or whine. I have been successful in the past when left in a quiet room in a crate.\n\n I am allergic to chicken and I'm required to be on a diet with limited or no grain foods while also avoiding beef. I take fish oil supplements to help my itchy skin caused by my allergies. I am an otherwise strong and healthy boy. \n\nHistorically, black dogs, especially black pitbulls, have been hard to adopt. I am a happy and loving pup who wants nothing more than a family of my own to create memories with. If you think we would make a good match please fill out an application for adoption. I look forward to meeting you! \n\nRescue Video:\nwww.facebook.com/MisterEric2018/videos/306964616774603\n\nAdoption Form:\nwww.cognitoforms.com/MissGabrielFoundation/PetAdoptionApplication\n\nEmail Address:\ninfo@missgabriel.org\n\nPhone Number:\n541-582-1521\n\nMailing Address: \nMiss Gabriel Foundation\nP.O.

He must be adopted with Trixie as they are a bonded pair.\n\nTango was brought in with his kennel mate Trixie because their owner was moving.\n\nHe is a loving and playful guy who enjoys his toys and even taking a dip in the baby pool.\n\nTango is the more confident of the pair and helps Trixie to feel more comfortable.\n\nHe often checks on her to make sure she is safe and secure in new situations.\n\nHe does well on a leash but they will require a home with a fenced yard for their safety.\n\nThey would do well in a quieter home with adopters who understand how to help shy dogs gain confidence and learn to trust.\n\nAlso, we believe they would do better in a home without small children.\n\nTrixie and Tango are wonderful dogs and they would love to have a forever home.\n",

She loves kids of different ages. Madison knows her basic commands and responds when corrected. She does, however, need to be the only dog in a home. Madison would love to meet you and hopefully can find her furever home.\n\nThe adoption fee is $250. She is up-to-date on all her shots, microchipped and spayed. If you are interested please apply at https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\nIf your app is a good fit for the dog we will call you to set up a meet. \n\n* It is our goal to ensure that all our animals are a good fit for their new family. Because of this, it is Paws Up 4 Rescue's policy to do home visits before an adoption. Because puppies must be able to return to our vet for additional vetting after the adoption is finalized we do not adopt out of state. No exceptions. \n\n**Please note that the breed designation is often our best guess based on distinguishing markings. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/\nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

Her skin is being treated and is healing nicely and she will be undergoing surgery the first week of September to repair her hip. Marlee doesn\u2019t let anything slow her down. She romps and plays in the yard right along with all the others. She loves to run outside and to sunbathe. She\u2019s great in the house and great. She\u2019s good with dogs, cats and kids. She\u2019s utd, hw negative (tested below detectable levels) and spayed. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

It took her weeks to not be scared in her foster home, and months to go near males in the home. She naturally takes to women faster than men, but needs to be allowed to warm up to all people on her own terms. She gets along with most of the dogs in her foster home, though there is a grumpy old resident dog in her foster home that she does not do well with. She does great with the resident cat, and loves kids of all ages. She can be pretty playful around kids, so older kids would probably be best. She is crate trained, house trained, and loves to cuddle and wants to give you tons of love once she trusts you. Any potential adopter will need to be willing to let Stella take the time she needs to transition into her new home and not give up on her.",

Easter loves people, but is a little too energetic for small children. She is good with other dogs under supervision as she hasn't quite got the hang of playing yet. Easter is crate trained and knows some basic commands. She is spayed, current on vaccines, and heart worm negative. \n\nEaster is currently being fostered in South Alabama, but we can arrange a meet and greet closer to you. Send us an email for more information.  Our adoption applications are available at www.blackcatsolddogs.org/adoption-information",

She needs time and reassurance of her surroundings.  Lilly weighs 50 lbs.\n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $600 USD and that will pay for his/her transport, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip, rabies and health certificate.\n\nPlease e-mail us for an adoption application or more information rodedog@peoplepc.com",

            "description": "Hello everyone! My name is Sabor and guess what? I am the world's sweetest dog! Here are a few basic facts about me. I am just a rescue dog and nothing fancy. I'm estimated to be around 10 years old. Looks like I am a chihuahua mix of some sort. I'm mostly black with some tan on my face and paws. I weigh about 14 pounds, and if you love me, you won't overfeed me because I sure love to eat. But I also love to take short walks and I'm great on a leash. The walks are good for me and you, and I don't pull on the leash at all. By the way, I am also great when I encounter other dogs or people.\n\nIn fact, I'm fabulous with other dogs. I live in a foster home with a bunch of other dogs and get along with everyone. I am a very laid back and low energy guy. I am crate trained and housetrained (if kept on a frequent schedule). I don't bark much either. I do have to tell you that I have several health issues and need to take medication twice a day. I take my pills very easily. Just put them in a bit of cheese or lunch meat or a pill pocket. I am very well controlled on my medication and, except for some hair loss and bigger-than-average tummy, you would never know that I have any health problems.\n\nSo you see, I'm just about perfect. I love to snuggle on your lap and I'm affectionate, but not needy. I would do great in a variety of homes. Toddlers and young children probably would not be my best match as I'm a mature fellow, but older ones are fine. I'm also adaptable and could easily enjoy life in an apartment or a house with a fenced yard. My only requirement is a loving home...Is that yours?\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms",

She can be very shy and scared at first especially with men and needs time to warm up to potential adopters. She gets along with other dogs but can sometimes be bossy. She does well in a crate but has been with an outdoor only foster. With some training and/or perhaps a home with a doggy door we think she can be housebroken. Maizie would do best with older kids. Maizie has been with ARCC since July 2018. Maizie's ideal home would be with an older couple, or a family with older kids. She just needs a patient and loving home where she can show her full potential to be your best friend.",

            "description": "Maui - Female -DOB -12/30/17\n\nBeautiful, almost 3 yr old Maui appears to possibly be a mix of German short hair Pointer, Pit Bull.\n\nA lovely spirit, gentle, a timid dog until she knows you. Very shy. Men and children terrify her.\n\nShe has the body of a Pointer, tall and lean, and the loving eyes of a Pit Bull. Her mama is a Pit Bull.\n\nHere are a list of things that we feel Maui will need in her new home, for Maui to continue to be a happy dog.\n\nPlease read the following 6 questions. If your answers are YES to ALL of them, we encourage you to please fill out an application for Maui!\n\n1. Do I have only females (humans) living in my/our home? (2 previous adoptions with a male in the home failed)\n2. Does my home have another full time, young, playful, medium/large dog for Maui to grow old with? \n3. Is someone (female) home a lot? \n4. Am I able to continue her on the inexpensive medication Buspirone, for her fearfulness?\n5. Do I have a large rural yard, securely surrounded with a wooden 6 ft tall fence? (she needs a large yard for exercise and playing fetch)\n6. Do I live in a rural/country area?\n\nMaui is a high energy dog that needs a large enough yard to burn off energy. She loves to play fetch, chew on squeaky toys and play with other large dogs. She also likes to snuggle with her human foster parents. She's a very gentle, playful, sweet -but timid dog.\n\nFor her happiness and mental health, Maui will need a home in country with a 6ft secure wooden fence, and a large yard. She enjoys having playtime in the yard to play and romp with another, medium to large dog, and to play fetch with her human.\n\nDue to her timid behavior around people, she will need at least one other friendly, YOUNG, playful. medium to large dog to live with and grow up with. Without this, she will NOT be a happy dog, so it is a must.\n\nCity life will not work for Maui, she is too nervous for city, suburban living. All the cars and people make her extremely uncomfortable and she would have a complete meltdown. In the country, she is more comfortable. Maui will walk cautiously on a leash, but not without another canine sibling by her side. She would much rather run and play in her fenced yard with a female human, and another fun dog. A home is for Maui's best interest.\n\nOnce she knows you, she is the sweetest, cuddly, playful, gentle dog. At first she is leery of new people and will run in fear. She doesn't have a mean bone in her body, she's just nervous at first and fearful. It will take her a bit of time to become comfortable with her new humans... but once she gains your trust, she will follow you around and be your best friend.\n\nDue to Maui's sensitive temperament, she will require multiple meets and possibly some sleep overs before adoption. We want her transition to be as smooth and easy on her as possible. \n\nMaui, unfortunately was NOT properly socialized at the crucial weeks of her young life that she needed to be. Because of this, she's a VERY TIMID dog around new people. She's NEVER aggressive, has never attempted to bite, she just shies away from people until she trust them... which will take time and patience.\n\nShe's such a sweet dog, she just needs the right home, one that understands this is her temperament and she is shy by nature. \n\nRecap:\nMaui is sweet, gentle, playful and most comfortable with women,once she knows them. If she doesn't know someone, she tries to run away from them. She has never attempted to nip, she's just incredibly timid. \n\nShe was never abused, she was raised with her mama and siblings, then surrendered to rescue because the owners couldn't afford to alter all the pups and wanted the best for them.\n\nMaui is timid when meeting new people/places so she needs a lot of patience, by nature she has a shy temperament. Having another friendly, well balanced canine sibling will help her overcome this.\n\nShe's potty trained and crate trained, and walks pretty well on a leash, UNTIL she sees a stranger, then she becomes fearful. She will greet dogs in a calm and friendly manner, but will air snap at them if they rush her. (fear)\n\nShe's not a dog that will do well left home alone for hours. She is energetic, playful and most likely destructive if left home along and gets bored. A daycare would be too much for her.\n\nMaui is crate trained, but prefers to share the human bed. \n\nMaui will do best placed in a home with another young, playful, medium/large, well balanced dog, to learn from and grow old with. A dog friendly cat would be a bonus. She tries so hard to get the cats in her foster home to be her friends.\n\nMaui is a sensitive, timid dog by nature that wants nothing more than to please. She loves her humans and is a big cuddle bug, once she trusts. Couch and bed privileges a must, she loves to be close.\n\nShe will need a home that understands working with a timid dog. If yelled at, she will panic and run from it.\n\nShe will need a rural/country home with a large, 5-6 foot high fenced yard. She will do best with access to both inside and out, she loves being in the yard playing, but also wants to snuggle on the couch or floor near you. \n\nMaui is adjusting to car rides. She settles in, mainly because she's afraid. She doesn't whine, bark or pace. She will need continued help getting used to car rides. \n\nOur adoption process:\nApplication - approval\nMeet and greet - approval\nHome check - approval (for the safety of our rescued dogs)\nADOPTION\n\nAdoption Fee: $250\nIncludes:  spay, microchip, up to date shots, worm treatments, flea treatment and one beautiful, sweet, sensitive dog\n\n>>>>For more information or an application to adopt please email: kelley2nwac@gmail.com",

Due to fear of men, Maui WILL NEED A FEMALE ONLY home, with multiple friendly dogs. She's a very, very sweet dog, just highly sensitive and extremely afraid of new people. \nChildren scare her, she's never been aggressive, just extremely nervous and terrified of kids under 16 yrs. Due to her fears, she will NOT walk well outside without another friendly, well balanced dog to give her security. Maui LOVES to play fetch and will need a large securely fenced yard, in a rural setting. (wooden/ solid type fence).",

Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

Where her story could\u2019ve ended- it didn\u2019t. We had placed a hold on her but then the distemper outbreak happened. We had no idea if she would make it out or not. Fate stepped in and gave this beautiful girl a third or fourth chance because we have no idea what she went through before finding herself at Petco or the shelter...and to us she came! \nShe is a sweet happy girl and will make someone a wonderful companion could that person be you? If so fill out an application online at lakecharlespitbullrescue.com \nOur adoption fee is $250 and includes all shots, spay or neuter, microchip and private training with our trainer. All of our dogs are on Sentinel or Pro Heart for heart worm prevention. Please let me know if you have any questions.",

            "description": "Julius is a 10 year old labrador mixed with a bit of pit bull. He is about 60 pounds. He's a nice boy who loves being petted. He prefers female dogs and likes playing in the exercise yard with Penny, a 4 year old hound mix.\nThe wrinkles on the top of his head give him a bit of a sharpei look.\nHe has been with us a couple years and would love a home or foster.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Hi, My name is Gunther!\n\nI know, I don't look much like a Rottweiler, but I've got the heart of one!\n\nI think at least one of my parents may have been a shepherd, but I'm not really certain. That's ok though, I'm a pretty cute pup if I do say so myself. I'm about 75pounds or total cuteness who would love to find a special someone I can be loyal to and hang on their every word.\n\nSo how'd I become an honorary Rottweiler you may ask?\n\nWell, my foster mom saw me online and sent out a desperate plea to save me after finding out I was set to be euthanized because I was exposed to parvo after my kennel mate contracted it and passed away.\n\nJust so happens my foster mom had experience with parvo pups so they were all set up to be able to take me in and provide what I needed had I ended up with parvo too. Otherwise, my chances of making it out of the shelter alive were extremely slim.\n\nThe awesome folks with Southern States Rescued Rottweilers agreed I could become an honorary rottie and worked tirelessly overnight to get all the paperwork submitted to the shelter before my deadline. The next day my foster mom came to pick me up and I was soooooooooooooo happy to see her. She had little people with her too! How lucky was I? Jackpot!\n\nAfter 2 weeks in quarantine...it was very boring mind you, I never contracted parvo so I was free to be a puppy again.\n\nI love people! Like, I really, really love people! I want to be with people as much as possible. I actually think I'm people.\n\nSee, I don't really remember my siblings or my parents. I just know people. When I came to my foster home I wasn't quite sure about all these dogs and cats that were living there too. It took me a little time to get to know them and be sure they weren't going to do me harm. I've been in my foster home for awhile now and get along really well with all my foster siblings, 4 legged and 2 legged. Well, except one, but he starts it. He does scare me though and I will get defensive sometimes. My foster family keeps us separated but they are working with both of us to overcome our fear of each other. I get it...he came from a rough situation too and I'm bigger than he is so he's just as scared of me as I am of him. We've come a long way, but still have some work to do.\n\nI do love my foster sisters most. They really get me out and about running around and wrestling. I don't initiate it myself though. If I had a choice, I'd rather go for a walk with my foster people or just hang out with them.\n\nThey have these furry animals called cats. Have you seen these things!? I tried to get a good look at them by sticking my face in their face, but one was always hitting me so I leave her alone now. The other one is big and scary. I think he's part dog. I don't mess with him. There's a little one too. She doesn't do much but sleep so I just let her be. I'm told I'm a good dog when I do. I really like being told I'm a good dog .\n\nSometimes I get excited and jump up, but with the help of my foster family, I've been doing that less and less. I really just love them so much I want to be right there where they can reach me without having to bend over. Just looking out for them. I walk really well on a leash. Actually, I prefer to be walked. I like having my people beside me even when I go outside for a potty break.\n\nI love my people and will hang on every word if you let me. I like to be guided and directed and will do very well with time and training.....VERY well! \n\nI also know basic commands....sit, shake, am crate trained and know how to use a doggie door.\n\nI'd do well in a home as an only dog or with 1-2 other non dominant dogs. I'm ok with small children once I get over my initial excitement, but considering my size and that I still can't always control my jumping, I may be better suited to a family with bigger kids or in a home with dog savvy children. I also would do well in a single or coupled household who is looking for a dog to train and be a companion.\n\nIf you think you'd love to have me be a part of your family forever and can provide me that time and training that will make me become the best pup ever, please fill out an application and one of SSRR's adoption coordinators will be in contact with you. Hope to meet you soon!",

If you are looking for a life-long friend, maybe we will be the perfect match.\n\nHere\u2019s my stats:\nPossible Breed:  Lhasa Apso and Brussels Griffon\nGender:  I\u2019m a guy, a dude, an hombre\nColors:  Cream\nAge:  The vet says about 6 years young\nWeight:  Around 17 pounds\n\nHastings is a very loving pup and he loves to play! He has had a tough road before he came to us. He was hit by a car but has fully recovered and \nhas no no limitations on his activity. He was also heart worm positive when he came to us. He has been successfully treated for heart worms and is now ready for a new home. Hastings did bite when he first came to rescue so he must go to a home with no children under the age of 16. \n\nIf you are an approved adopter, email adoptioninquiries@yahoo.com and we will arrange a meeting. If you have not yet been approved, begin an application to adopt Hastings or one of our other pups at www.shihtzu-rescue.com. \n\nPS. I've had ALL my vetting, and oh boy, it was a lot. Here's what I had done:\nDistemper/Parvo shots \u2013 TWICE. One shot doesn't cut it.\nBordetella shots - ALSO TWICE. \nSpay/Neuter-of course.\nA fecal exam so I don't have any bad worms. Treatment if I do.\nA heartworm test. Treatment if I am positive for heart worms\nBLOODWORK to make sure my liver and kidneys are working well, because you know, we doggies often have issues in the liver and kidneys.\nA DENTAL exam AND cleaning if I needed it- yep, all my toofies are checked out.\nSee, that's a LOT. Ask your vet - that's a LOT.\n\n",

She is spayed, current on her vaccinations, and nicely house trained.  She has been very cared for and loved, but her mom is a health care worker whose hours have increased and \"Brindee\" is NOT getting the exercise or attention she once was getting.  She needs room to run and an active family who will take her camping, recreating, and that has a nice large yard for her to run and play in.\n\n\"Brindee\" loves to play frisby and fetch and is extremely agile.  She would be great with agility training and is smart and eager to learn.  She is crate trained, but her high energy level is just too much for her to handle being crated for long periods of time while her owner works.  She has experienced some separation issues because she has been left behind and has too much energy.  She has been living with a pitbull for several years and they play well together, but just not enough action for \"Brindee.\"\n\nFor and application to adopt, email kathy@3dogrescue.com which can be completed online.  Her adoption fee is $200 and she will come with her complete vet records, her bedding, food, and a crate if you so desire.  We do not adopt to families with children under the age of 5 and prefer to adopt within a 200 mile radius of Cody/Powell area as we have a two week trial period before adoptions are final.\n\n",

He was an owner surrender due to the fact that he did not like the female teenager in the family. Milo has been perfectly fine with my 13-year-old daughter but we would prefer a home with  no small children.  He loves to get a picture taken. He will pose as soon as he sees the camera. He is a very happy boy as well which made it hard to get a picture without him wiggling. Milo gets along with other dogs. He will make a wonderful addition to anyone\u2019s family.  Housebroke and crate trained. Milo has  been neutered , up to date on all shots and heartworm tested negative. Groomed and front line. Microchipped.  His adoption fee is $400. We only adopt out to indoor homes. Vet reference and home check a must.  Please remember to include your phone number in your reply.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Nova but I also answer to my previous name, Zoe. My caretakers say I\u2019m the sweetest dog at the kennel and very special, bringing joy to those around me. They think that I might me a full-blooded Pitbull Terrier.\n\nI love to sit on laps and be loved on, and at 70 lbs there is a lot of me to love! I like to play with stuffed animals and other dogs, but I don\u2019t like being growled at. I\u2019m a powerful dog but good with older kids. I prefer a home without cats. \n\nIf I don\u2019t know someone I may nip at them through the fence. My caretakers think I may have been kept penned up too much in my previous home, but once I\u2019m let out of my kennel I run and play with the other dogs. I\u2019m also housetrained.\n\nI was about 6 years old when I came to the shelter in August, 2018. I\u2019ve been vaccinated, dewormed, flea treated, microchipped, and will be spayed before going to my furever home.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in me, please come meet me and take me for a walk to get to know me!\n\n\nFor more information on Nova please call Sierra's Haven at 1-740-353-5100. Come visit us any time to meet and get to know our pets. All dogs will be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines, and tested to make sure that they are heartworm negative before the adoption process can be completed. Birth dates and ages for our pets are usually approximate. Call Sierra's Haven to make sure that the pet that you are interested in is still available for adoption and that they are ready to be adopted.

Still very frightened - obviously had a bad start in life.  Transferred to Great Pyr Rescue - NE.  He will be with us until his confidence is built up.  3/13/19   UPDATE:  We ran DNA on Blizzard.  Of his eight great-grandparents, five were Pyrs.  One was Anatolian, one was Australian Shepherd, and one was Rhodesian Ridgeback!  No wonder we have a very cautious, fast-moving dog.  He has white eyelashes and double dewclaws, but otherwise, I see the Anatolian and the Ridgeback.  This boy is strong on recessive genes.  He's a love, but it takes a while for him to trust you.  Anyone adopting him will need to invest time gaining his trust, but then will have a very handsome, faithful hound.  10/20/19   Blizzard is getting sweeter every day, but still is very doubtful about strangers, especially men.

He loves peanut butter Kong\u2019s from the freezer at bedtime. Are you the active family for Sparky? Are you a hiking family, jogger, beach goer, camping, if so Sparky wants to hang out with you. He does well with another dog, he will annoy them to play a lot, so no tired seniors.",

She also needs a fenced yard. <P>\n\nDELLA's first few months of  life were wretched---she lived in a filthy crate in a backyard until she was confiscated from her \"owner\" by cruelty investigators.  At the time she was rescued, DELLA was about nine months old and weighed  only 17 pounds--she was literally skin and bones --her fur was scanty, her ribs and hipbones were fully visible, and her paws were splayed from malnutrition.  DELLA is now a normal weigh for her size, and enjoys the activities she had been deprived of in her former life.    Her coat is thicker and more lustrous and she now has the stamina to play and run in her fenced yard.   Despite the neglect she experienced, DELLA is a happy girl and she is looking for a forever home with guardians who will provide security, care and love. <P>\n \n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption.  This pet  is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives. \n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old.  We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs.\n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details. \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE OPEN HOURS!  WE MEET ADOPTERS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY!!!!\nAN ONLINE APPLICATION IS THE FIRST STEP TO MEETING A NEW PET.  Once\nyour application is approved, our adoption coordinator will be in touch with you to set up a meeting.  Some animals are in our adoption center; others are in foster homes.  PLEASE DO NOT COME TO OUR ADOPTION CENTER UNLESS YOU HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION AND AN APPOINTMENT.\n\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

I had a very tough time before DFW Tzu's took me in. My right eye was badly damaged and had to be removed but I am sighted in my left eye and can get around just fine. I can see darkness and light and shadows. I have no problems getting around but I have to have over the counter Systane to keep my left eye moist so I can continue to see. Also I have to take medication twice a day to prevent very mild seizures. Nothing dramatic. My foster dad can fill you in if you want to meet me and I hope you do! I prefer to be an alone dog but get along well with a calm female companion pup. I need someone at home most of the day but I'm ok if your gone for a few hours. I'm well house trained and if you let me outside regularly I won't make mistakes. I'm also trained on potty pads! I can't be baby gated in a  room alone or crated, I panic. If house loose I won't make a mess, chew or damage anything. I just like to be a couch potato and will sleep a lot. I am curious about children but really don't like to be around them. I get scared. If you have had dogs with sight issues and want a funny handsome new family member I could be the one!\nAll DFW Tzus dogs are spayed/neutered, UTD on vaccines, heart worm tested and on heart worm preventative and microchipped.\n<font color=\"purple\">Please go to our website:     www.dfwtzusandmorerescue.com   \nfor complete instructions on our adoption process and for adoption application. </font>\nCheck our website for directions/times of our next Tzu Review/Adoption event at a local Petsmart.\n<font color=\"purple\">Note: The children of adopters must be age 6 or older.</font>\n\n<bold> WE ADOPT IN THE DFW METROPLEX AREA ONLY. </bold>\n\n<font color=\"fuchsia\"><bold> <h2>WE ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF VOLUNTEERS/FOSTER HOMES.</h2><br></bold> \n<bold>PLEASE GO TO OUR WEBSITE TO COMPLETE A VOLUNTEER/FOSTER APPLICATION\n OR TO MAKE A DONATION TO ASSIST WITH THE MEDICAL CARE OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.

            "description": "Sonny is an 11 year old (as of April 2019) Chinese Crested/Chihuahua mixed dog.  He was surrendered to the Humane Society because his mom developed medical conditions that didn't allow her to be able to care for him.  \n\nHe is a very laid back, chill dog.  He is good with other dogs as long as they aren't too rambunctious.  He prefers to sit with his human and be petted than to play.  He will run and play a little in the yard, but once he's inside, play time is over.  If you're looking for a true lap dog, your search is over.\n\nSometimes, it seems like he knows exactly what you're saying to him.  He's reactive to being given directions.  He does have a mind of his own, though.  He knows the command \"Get in your crate\" but doesn't like it, so he will jump on the sofa instead.  lol  Then I will carry him to his crate.\n\nHe is not house trained or crate trained.  Being a small dog, he does have accidents in his crate overnight and during the day when he's left for an extended period of time.  He does mark, so a belly band is being used.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this particular dog or puppy, please see our Adoption Guidelines at http://www.humanesocietyall.com/applications.  If you feel like you qualify for adoption, please fill out our Dog Adoption Application which can be found at the same link. Be sure to save your completed application before closing it so you will not lose your information. You may return the completed application via email to  jessica_adams147@yahoo.com. Please allow 1-3 business days for your application to be reviewed. Thank you for considering adoption of a rescued pet!\n\nEven if you are unable to adopt one of our pets at this time, please consider sponsoring this pet with a donation. No donation is ever too small and allows us to keep saving lives.  Our paypal address is:  paypal@humanesocietyall.com\n\nThank you!",

This poor lady was dumped at a church in rural Paulding County with nasty ear infections, worn down teeth, terribly itchy skin, and painful tumors. We were able to fix Mia up and remove her tumors. Her large tumor that was dragging on the ground ended up being a giant benign skin-tag! Despite being in such rough shape, she was always happy and loves attention.\nABOUT MIA\nMia is enjoying the pampered life of being a loved house-dog. She seems to be a bit dominant with other dogs at first, but she definitely wants to play. Her foster-mom took introductions slow and she is now best friends with her doggie foster siblings. Mia is very in-tune with any noise from the kitchen and will be there within seconds upon first wrapper tare. She loves to squeeze her big self between you and the couch as she loves attention, but is not overly demanding about it. Overall, Mia is very low key. She is has learned many manners like how to sit, wait for her meals, walk on a leash, and come when she's called. When treats are involved, this lady is a quick learner! Mia has been fully vetted. Mia is a happy, very sweet little lady who is looking for a family of her very own!\nPhoto Album of Mia: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2018337798224376&type=1&l=27ac60d10b\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats and we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

            "description": "Please contact Nunnallee for more information about this pet.Tony came to us from local shelter. He is very in-tune to his people. He gets along with other pups and enjoys a good romp and playtime. Tony is making progress with his manners, and is generally an easy keeper! At 6 years, Tony is still quite an active boy, athletic and agile, making him an ideal candidate for a running or walking buddy. He can be a rascal around cats (the chase is just too much fun to resist) so a no-cat home would be best!\n\nWhile Tony adores attention from the kiddos, he's not quite aware of his own exuberance, and would be a better fit for a home with older, respectful children. Tony has waited a long time for a forever home. We know his his family is out there, just waiting to connect!\n\nAs his foster family, we will miss him! We would love to hear how he is doing should you choose to add Tony to your family, and send updates!",

She enjoys having a job and can spend hours playing nose work and scent games. Zelda has attended training classes to work on her basic manners, more polite greetings and classes to keep that sharp mind engaged. Zelda would do best in an extremely active home environment. A home that has time to both physically and mentally exercise her daily. Zelda can be too excitable with other dogs; it is this behavior that has limited her canine friends. Her ideal placement will be a single dog home. This exuberance level also has us looking for a home with no small children, as they can be easily knocked down. \n\nOur adoption process starts with our application. Once the application is approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home visit usually last 1- 1 1/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the 2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and all except $100.00 of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial, you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION FEE's:\nPuppies under 6 months:  $199.00\nAdults:  $150.00\nSeniors (over 7 yrs):  $99.00\n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please fill out an application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/193425528783165",

            "description": "Bubbles has an enlarged heart\nAlthough we do our very best to make sure your new pup is in tiptop health before adoption, things could drastically change a month later. Since we don't have a long health history of your adopted dog, we can only treat her for whatever symptoms that present during the initial exam and follow up exams. - -\n\nHealth: When Bubbles first came into our rescue (early 2018) a benign mass was removed from her neck. She also was successfully treated for heart worms and numerous parasites. This girl was very sick when we first received her.\n\n*****On April 24th, she was diagnosed with an enlarged heart. She is on Lasix and Enalapril twice a day for the rest of her life. Initially it was difficult to administer her medication. She now enjoys her medication when it is put into a small bit of liverwurst and offered as a \"treat\". ***** No other obvious health issues have been diagnosed. - -\n\nTemperament: She has only been used for breeding, so she is more comfortable being with dogs than people. It will take some time and patience for her to learn that people can be nice. If you decide to adopt Bubbles, I hope you will consider that\nit will take some time\nbefore she becomes the lap dog you might be hoping for. Bubbles has been seriously mistreated her whole life. She is not going to trust you immediately. Please don't apply to adopt her unless you are very serious about putting in the time it will take to help her adjust to a \"normal\" dog life. -----------------------------------------------------------\n\nShe has never bitten anyone but she does run from you when she is outside and she will back herself into a corner when you reach for her inside. When you reach down to pick her up, she will throw her front paws up in the air and it almost looks like a small child reacting to someone picking them up. It would be funny except that she does it out of fear. I believe\nit will take a very long time for bubbles to relax and enjoy being part of the family.\nShe will not be easy but it will be very rewarding when she comes to you for a treat and to enjoy some ear scratching for the first time. Update 7/1/2019 Bubbles still retreats if you go to get her; however, she is starting to come and laydown and relax near her foster family daily especially if another dog is already there. She likes to be on the sofa and bed and will use dog steps to get up and down from the bed. --------------------------\n\nBubbles knows how to use a doggie door. She is crate trained as well. She is walking very well on a leash hooked to her collar or harness. She likes the harness the best and it's the safest way to walk her. She is most cooperative when walking alongside other confident dogs but she will walk by herself too. She will just be more on alert.\n\nWhere did she come from: She came from puppy mill closure. It was a really awful place. --\n\nAdoption: $324.75 ($300.00 fee + $24.75 required 8.25% sales tax)\nWeight: 9 lbs.\nDOB: 2/8/2009\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application.\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------- 2/2/21 3:35 PM",

We know he was taken from his mom and siblings too soon and we know he was tied up with a wire or coat hanger at some point.  The scar around his neck has healed but I'm sure the trauma remains.  Then he was left in Houston in a backyard to drown during Hurricane Harvey.  He was rescued by a group of dedicated volunteers who were in boats searching for dogs in danger. Butch was heartworm positive, too, but has now been treated and is very healthy.  \n\nLuckily for Butch, his rescuer was very committed and dedicated to him.  Butch spent two months with a behaviorist with fabulous results and has made dramatic improvements.  He has learned to be a happy dog, But some things remain and will always be with him.  \n\nButch needs a quiet, structured home with adults only.  No other animals, no children.  No exceptions.  This is not because he is aggressive -- far from it.  Butch is extremely affectionate and wants to please.  It is because he is fearful of quick movements and too much noise and energy.  Surprisingly, Butch has not shown any storm fearfulness, per se. \n\nButch LOVES his toys!!!  He has little bear, big bear and Mr. Hedgehog!  When he comes out of his kennel, he brings each one out, too, to lie down with him.  He has never torn  up his \"friends\" either. \n\nOur dream home for Butch would be an \"early retired\" couple or single person looking for a faithful and loving companion. Butch loves to take walks, but generally prefers to be a homebody and feel secure. \n\nPlease help us find the perfect home for this beautiful, sweet, deserving boy.",

I am a bit shy and reserved, but my foster dad is helping me explore my outgoing self. One way he does that is by taking me, and my foster brother, to work with him every day. That is great because I am an early riser. We get to ride, meet people, and just let our ears down. Another way he helps me is providing some structure and predictability. He understands I don't like abrupt or loud noises, and really like an all day \"basset buffet\" so I don't have to compete for my vittles. Mainly I like to hang out, ride around, sleep in the bed around my family, AND go outside.\n\nContact CBHR and let's start our furever!\n\nMedical needs: Cushing's disease\n\nTo apply online or to see other available Basset Hounds, go to www.cbhr.com.\n\nCarolina Basset Hound Rescue adopts in North and South Carolina.

Rosie has epilepsy that is well controlled with phenobarbital. She has not had a seizure in many months. She goes in once a year for bloodwork just to monitor her levels. The last time she had a cluster of seizures was this past summer and the vet increased her dose to better control it. In the past when she has had seizures, we just keep calm and they pass fairly quickly. \nHer medication costs about $40/ month.\nRosie was surrendered to us by her family in 2018. They were dealing with an at risk pregnancy and did not have time for her.  \nShe would thrive in a home with a fenced yard, no other dogs and someone to love her like she deserves.\nRosie is about 4 years old. She is spayed and up to date on vaccines. She is house trained and good in her crate. She is a well behaved co-pilot in the car. \nRosie\u2019s personality is very puppy like and she thoroughly enjoys every minute of her life. She easily makes me smile as she is playing with her toys or entertaining herself in the yard, and they way she runs and dances around the yard is a joyful sight. She loves to get the zoomies and stretch her long legs out. She likes to play keep away with her ball, but will chase it for as long as you will throw it.",

He most definitely loves his chin and belly rubbed.  He is very energetic so needs play time and walks.  He's not fond of other dogs or cats. His best fit would be a  home where he is the only animal. He will be a lap dog (he doesn't know his size) You would enjoy lots of love and kisses.  He is a great companion dog.  We can't stress enough how much He LOVES his people!.  His adopter will truly be blessed to have him in their lives/family.  He is handsome, loving, and can't wait to meet you!  He is especially loving with women so would be great company and a protector for a woman living alone.\n\nIf you feel like you may be interested, please do yourself a favor and at least meet him. He is such a wonderful, loving dog who deserves a home with a couch for cuddling!",

And do they say \"Savitar\" on them? That's MY name! (scrunches eyes tight) Please don't let this be a dream...please don't let this be a dream...\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1/10/19  Savatar has made great progress during his time at our rescue. He gets along with the dogs at his foster home and does fine with them however if he doesn't know a dog he is very confrontational and aggressive. For this reason we think he should be an only dog unless he is adopted with Simi who came to us with him and they were surrendered at the kill shelter together.  Savatar does great with the kids in his foster home ages 12-15 yrs but unless constantly supervised we feel he needs to be in a home without kids.  \n\nSavatar takes a long time to build trust. The abuse he suffered was terrible and he needs a home that will understand, be firm and not afraid to help him adjust.  \n\n\nUPDATE:9/25/18 Savitar is making great strides in his touch therapy. Savitar can now be pet just about anywhere as long as he isn't startled. Savitar is learning to get along with the other members of the pack at the rescue but he still tries to challenge the dominant male. We still recommend only females or he be an only dog. Savitar has gain about 15 lbs since we first pulled him from the kill shelter and is no longer gobbling his food down. He is starting to understand that not all humans are bad and there is more food coming. We recommend an experienced rottie person. \n\nSavitar was pulled from a kill shelter where he was owner surrendered severely emaciated and showing signs of being abused. Savitar was surrendered with his mate Simi who we also have. \n\nSavitar has a few issues we are currently working on. He does not like to be touch on both sides of his head/muzzle. He flinches away from unexpected touch but on the other hand he is very affectionate and can often be found trying to crawl in the lap and lay his head on the shoulder of one of the founders.  However, the sensitivity to touch in certain locations we do not recommend young children.\n\nSavitar is fine with all of the dogs in our pack except our pack leader. Savitar tries to challenge him for dominance.  For this reason we suggest he be the only male dog.  \n\nSavitar is really a sweet dog given the chance and just needs to right understanding owner to help him learn to trust people again.  Savitar enjoys his daily runs with one of the founders sons (14yrs old) and can often be found visiting with the bull we have at our rescue.  \n\nSavitar is crate trained, potty trained, working on basic obedience and leash manners and experiencing touch therapy to help him learn that not all touch is bad. \n\n",

She is UTD on vaccines, spayed, HW neg and microchipped.\n\nLayla is very frightened in new situations but once she has gained your trust she loves you and greets you with wagging tail. She is not a dog that likes to be cuddled. She is good with other dogs and has shown no aggression with them. She is housebroken and crate trained. She loves the security of her big crate and blanket. She was not used to going outside to potty but now does that willing. Layla does not do well being forced to do something like being put in a cage at the vet.\n\nShe should be adopted close to middle TN so no transport is required.\n\nLayla should not be placed with children because of her fearfulness.\n\nShe loves being outside and will require a fenced yard.\n\nLayla is being fostered in Tennessee. Her adoption fee is $275.00 For more information on Layla, contact settertown@aol.com. 2/2/21 4:21 PM",

Abbie is a very special girl who's had a rough time of it so far. Taken from a neglectful situation as a skinny, wormy bellied puppy, she has spent the majority of her young life in boarding (well cared for, but not a home). New situations are difficult for her and she needs routine and patience to help settle her into her new home. While Abbie enjoys playing with some dogs, she chooses her friends carefully and has decided she would rather not share a home with a canine (or feline) pal. We certainly don't blame her, she's waited this long, she deserves the attention all for herself! A home with a securely fenced yard she can run and play in, a quiet neighborhood for daily walks, a comfy crate complete with her favorite nylabone for security, an experienced, active adult family with NO kids, who will give her the routine and time she needs to settle in - these are all on Abbie's wish list for her new family. You will be rewarded with a super snuggly, silly girl to entertain you.. If you fit the bill, she'd love to meet you! Abbie is approximately two years young and weighs a bit under 50 lbs.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

            "description": "NOTE: Adoptions are by appointment only. If you are seriously interested in adopting an animal that you see on this site, one that is located at the county animal shelter, please call the shelter for information about the animal you are considering and to get information about how adoptions may take place now that the \u201cstay at home\u201d order is lifted, to ensure your safety and the safety of the staff using social distancing protocols now in place. \n\nBE PATIENT!!!  AND BE KIND TO THE STAFF.  They take excellent care of the animals and facilities with the small, core staff and funds they are allocated through the county budget.  For more information about the county animal shelter policies and procedures, please go to the Cumberland County, Tennessee government website. Click on Departments, then Mayor\u2019s departments, and then click on Animal shelter. Many local residents are not aware that the specific purpose and mission of the animal shelter is limited to taking in and caring for animals brought in by the animal control officers employed by the county and the City of Crossville. It is not required to accept stray animals from the public, nor is it required to accept animals surrendered by the public. Whether they choose to do so now that the \u201cstay at home\u201d policy is lifted, is up to the county and Is subject to change at any time without notice.\n\nNOTE: You actually CAN donate to the shelter directly by making your check out to Cumberland County AND noting on the check: \u201cAnimal Shelter Donation.\u201d  Or you can use the donate feature on Petfinder which allows you to donate money to sponsor pets at the shelter. You may not designate the specific animal, or how the money is to be used. However, be assured that the money will be directed to the animal shelter donation fund by the county. Anyone wishing to continue to donate needed goods at this critical time, such as dry or wet dog food, dry or wet cat food, cat litter, paper towels, bleach, sanitizing hand wipes, clean towels is still welcome to do so.   Call first so that they can tell you how you can safely get the donated items into their hands.\n\nThis petfinder shelter site is maintained by a private citizen and not the shelter staff. So, PLEASE call them during them during their normal, but limited, business hours if you have questions and to determine if an animal you are considering adopting is still available.  \n\nAll stray dogs, cats, puppies and kittens that arrive at the shelter must meet certain city or county hold periods to give owners a chance to find and claim them.  Even animals surrendered by their owners are held by the shelter for sufficient time to evaluate their general health, their reaction to vaccines and dewormers and their suitability for adoption to the public.  \n\nKITTENS and PUPPIES are held for approximately (at least) 16 days from the date of intake so that their first two shots can be administered, two weeks apart.  Even then, if they do not meet spay/neuter weight requirements, it will be even longer before they are available.  Unfortunately, vaccines can, and often do, cause the animals to experience symptoms of the very diseases and conditions they are designed to prevent.  \n\nSo, even after they have had the second vaccine, if the symptoms appear, staff has to start a 2-week course of antibiotic treatment with each animal thus infected.  \n\nWith the opening of the new adoption center in July 2018, all of the animals are no longer housed in the same building.\n\nThe building called the \"intake facility\" is used to house all incoming animals. It is closed to the general public.  Only those people dropping off stray or surrendered animals and those who are looking for their missing pets will be directed by the adoption center staff to the intake building.  There is no public parking at that building and staff will direct you as to how to walk to that building if they authorize you to do so.\n\nThose who are looking to adopt an animal are asked to go to the new adoption center which is to your left as you come through the gates and up the driveway.  The old building to the right is closed to the public.\n\nIf you are interested in an animal whose photo you see online, you must schedule an appointment with staff at the adoption center to see it. You may also check with staff by telephone first to determine if it has been adopted. This is highly recommended, especially if you will be driving quite a distance. If you schedule an adoption appointment to meet with a cat or a dog that is already spayed or neutered, that animal is able to go home the same day that it is adopted. Staff strongly encourages you to bring an appropriate sized cat carrier or dog crate, as well as your own leash, to make sure that you and your new pet arrive home safely together.\n\nBecause animals can become ill at any time even after they go to the adoption center, staff may have to return them to the intake facility for further evaluation and treatment.  Their pictures still may be on petfinder.com as available. This is is not done to frustrate you!  This site is maintained by a private citizen to help get general information on shelter animals out to the public looking for lost animals and to adopt new family pets. Staff may make more animals available for adoption at the shelter before they can be added to this site. Likewise, some animals may be removed from adoptable status at any time and those may not be reflected to this site right away. For your best adoption experience, call the shelter staff before you decide to head to their location. Get all of the information concerning the animal\u2019s temperament, Health history while at the shelter, availability, the adoption paperwork and related fees, animal shelter hours and method of payment before driving to their location. \n",

She is very active and loves to play play play! She can't wait to have her very own fenced yard to run around in. She would be a great buddy to go on long walks with or hiking with. She is just ready to explore the world and all it has to offer. \n\nBoogie is not a fan of other dogs and likes all of the attention for herself. She needs to be the only dog in the home and is not a dog park candidate. She also has some guarding issues and young children who don't understand and have tiny fingers are not a good fit for her.  However, Boogie is working on some of her issues.\n\n Her adoption includes the following training:  3 in home sessions (the first being when he is brought to his forever home). 2 six week classes (basic obedience & intermediate obedience) and unlimited play groups for 3 month.\n\nIf you look into Boogies eyes and see the love and possibility, then fill out an application to adopt her here: http://www.moemoesrescue.com",

She can definitely keep a yard free of squirrels. She is house trained, crate trained and knows her basic good manners. Muriel is spayed, micro-chipped, and vaccinated. She is an active girl who enjoys learning new things and would love an active owner. Email pitcrewapplication@gmail.com for an application, her adoption fee is just $50 dollars because she is sponsored by Kelli Barto, requires a fully fenced yard, and that you live within 45 minutes of Toledo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While in her foster home recovering from surgery she showed that she is housebroken and crate trained. A year later Nani's other hip started to give her issues and she had the opposite hind ACL repaired. Nani has done amazing in her foster home and enjoys watching the world go buy. She is looking to be the center of attention in a home with no other animals or young children. Nani loves to play in the yard and enjoys her walks. This sweet girl has been with us for over two years and has yet to find her home. If you have the space and time for this big hunk come meet our darling Nani today!

            "description": "Hi! My name is Gus!\n\nI am a 3-year-old Pit Bull mixI'm healthy, vaccinated, and neutered. Please don't be afraid of me because of my breed!\n\nI love humans and I'm great with kids. Unfortunately, I don't do well with other dogs; part of me would love another doggie friend, and maybe with some more training that would be possible, but for now, I need an owner that respects my need to stay away from other pups. Cats are also off-limits because I think it's fun to chase them - they look like chew toys to me\n\nMost importantly I will love my humans with all my heart. I will wait outside of the bathroom to make sure they are ok. I will want to cuddle up with them at night. Anywhere my humans go is where I want to be. I do have some abandonment issues, so please be patient with me. I will get more comfortable and secure over time. Please give me a chance to have a forever home, you won't regret it!\n\nIf you would like to meet Gus, please submit a completed\nadoption application found\nat www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. He is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short or long term doggie foster families. We much appreciate the help and time of our fosters.

We do work with our sister and brother rescues in other areas as well. Please consider your local Sheltie rescue before applying outside your area. \n\nWe will NOT ship our available dogs.  A home visit by a volunteer is required before an application can be approved.  ********************************************************************************************\nHope is a shy little Sheltie girl.  She loves to play with the other Shelties in her foster home but she is still wary of people.   She will cower when cornered to be picked up.  She has also displayed some submissive wetting though that is not consistent. \n\nShe is a good traveler but she is a HUGE flight risk! A securely fenced yard is required in Hope's forever home.\n\nHope is a totally different dog when she doesn't know a person is watching,  She runs and plays. But as soon as a person is seen, she's back to shy little Hope.  She will need another confident, playful dog in  her forever home.\n\nShe takes treats nicely and loves braunschweiger.  \n\nHope will be 3 years old in Septemeber. She came from a commercial breeding facility.  She's learning what it's like to be a companion but it will take some time.  Hope will require completion of a basic, group obedience class as part of her adoption agreement.  We feel that will help improve her self esteem and make her a more confident dog.  Enrollment must be done within 30 days of placement and proof of completion provided within 120 days of placement.    \n\nHope has a thick, plush coat!  She is easy to groom but be prepared for lots of brushing!\n\nHope is not good with smaller or more submissive dogs.  She wants to be in charge. \n\nApply to adopt Hope at www.SheltieRescue.org\nHope's adoption fee is $450",

BooBoo just participated in our rehabilitation program and is now looking for his very own home to help him practice all the lessons he learned! BooBoo is good with other dogs and knows basic manners around the home. He is currently in a foster home with children and acts appropriately, although we always recommend working with children and the dogs to ensure healthy boundaries and proper behavior from everyone. \n\nBoo is a very quiet puppy who just likes to be near his people. His ideal family will be willing to learn more about his rehabilitation process so that they can provide a smooth transition. He will do best in a home with calm, confident leadership, which AHAS is happy to help teach his adopters all about. \n\nBoo is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm negative. We require an adoption application, home visit, and adoption fee. We will require boo\u2019s adopters participate in a training class to fully prepare them to provide him with the best care possible.

            "description": "Trilogy is special pup that came into the rescue from the Rescue's Veterinary Office.  The local shelter had found him wandering around town with a chain wrapped around his neck and front leg.  Unfortunately, this chain had been wrapped around him for sometime and had severely damaged the radial nerve in his front leg and he was left dragging the leg and was unusable.  After his leg was amputated, he ran around like he had been freed.  This amputation does not slow or hinder him at all, he is able to play, run, hike, climb stairs and do everything a 4 legged pup can do and he should not have any further issues with the amputated leg area.  \n\nTrilogy was heartworm positive when he came to us, and was fully treated and is now on heartworm preventative.  He is also current on all vaccines, tested negative for any tick borne diseases, neutered and microchipped.  \n\nIf you are interested in Trilogy, his adoption fee is lowered due to his special needs,  He does need a family without other animals, and older children would be better.  He is a loyal, sweet pup that just wants to be loved on all day long!",

Aries is sweet and affectionate, also active and playful - he LOVES to run! Aries gets on well with other dogs, although he can be a bit bossy with them, so a good match is important. He is house and crate trained, walk\u00a0ok on leash\u00a0- that could use some polishing - and rides well in the car. He is not destructive in the house and is rather quiet, but he needs a good amount of exercise to satisfy is need to run, so he is looking for an active family that will take him running or biking and stimulates his brain with training and games. He does not like to be alone and is looking for an active home where someone is home a lot\u00a0AND can give him the exercise he needs. He does need a well-maintained fence as he will exploit weaknesses or doors/gates left not quite shut.\n\nBeing a Shepherd mix, he does shed and needs regular brushing but he is well worth the effort as he is a head-turner wherever he goes!\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet  and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

Born April 2018; 33 pounds.\n\nIzzi was found dumped on a country road as a puppy and taken to a municipal rural shelter where we rescued her. She is a super survivor with a strong will to spread joy wherever she goes. (Izzi's momma was also rescued and she was a Bull Terrier/cattledog and we think Izzi also has smooth fox terrier in her.)\n\nIzzi is very smart! She knows all basic obedience, has great leash manners and is a high-energy gal. Izzi learns a lot from other dogs in her foster home and does best with large male dogs.\n\nIzzi's a very talented runner and jumper; she seems to want to fly -- and really enjoys playing fetch with a ball or soft frisbee. The best forever home for Izzi will offer an active lifestyle. Izzi has a very curious nature and really enjoys all the adventure found playing in a secure yard. Physical and mental exercise makes Izzi a happy dog! She likes to watch birds sing and cuddle with her person.\n\nIzzi is too interested in little things that run -- so for that reason, a home without children or small animals is required for this darling of a dog.\n\nIzzi is spayed, current on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Izzi's adoption contribution is $150. Contact SacredPawsDogs@gmail.com to learn more about beautiful Izzi!",

What lies beneath the surface is a companion who is eager to please, alert and protective, and thrives on learning new things and overcoming past obstacles by gaining trust. Hannah will do best as your one and only animal in the home \n\n \n\nShe walks well on a leash, knows basic commands, and is crate-trained for the times I am out of the house. Otherwise, she has free reign over the house and sleeps in my bed with me at night. She sleeps through the night with no potty demands. Her biggest desire is to be next to her human as often as possible. She would thrive with a family who is active. She loves going on walks or car rides. She loves playing fetch, catch, tug-of-war or just snuggled up resting beside me. She would be her best self if she is the only dog in the family. No experience with cats, etc.",

A lot of people thought I was aggressive, but one nice person recognized my fear and brought me to TIRR so I could work on my fear and learn to be loved and have fun again.\n\nI\u2019m much better now, though I\u2019m still wary around strange people - don\u2019t touch me until I touch you. I love to have fun and can be a bit of a dork sometimes. I\u2019m very much a ladies\u2019 man and would love to go to a home with an active person. However, I\u2019m a typical Ridgeback and will need an owner that is very familiar with my breed and can be a strong leader who will give me proper training.",

She is a girl who requires a little extra patience and some special handling, but she is SOOOO worth the investment of time and love.\n\nMango was a stray who \u2018picked\u2019 a family that she found. All the people in the family loved her, but Mango\u2019s high energy and exuberance proved to be too much for their older dogs.  Her play style with other dogs is rough-tumble and in-your-face, and not all other dogs are OK with that.  Once she trusts you, she is a velcro dog with her people. She does well with some of her foster friends, but will always need more socialization and she may never be a  'go everywhere' dog. Mango will thrive with a new family with people who have time to spend with her, who are willing to get training for her, who are willing to make sure she gets plenty of exercise \u2026 who are willing to love her and work with her to become the best dog she can be. Could that be you?\n\nPlease read the rest of Mango Grace's bio below to learn more about her!\n\nIf you think Mango might be the perfect pup for you, please go to www.allamericanmuttrescue.org, click on Forms/Application and complete your adoption application online.\n\nApproximate age/birthdate:  born ~ April 2015\n\n Weight/size: 45-50 lbs\n\n Housebroken:  YES (if you do your part letting her out regularly)\n\n Crate trained:  YES\n\n Personality:  busy, wary of new people at first, playful\n\nEnergy level:  very energetic, rough and tumble play style\n \nFenced yard required?:   YES ... No Exceptions.  Mango would be a danger to neighborhood cats and possibly small dogs. She has a high prey drive and is a bit 'dog selective'\n\nDoes he/she jump fences?  NO (but she could if she wanted to)\n\nLeash walk:  YES \u2026 high energy so will still pull\n\n Obedience training:  Knows \u2018sit\u2019\n\nRiding in vehicles:  RIDES OK \u2026 gets a little stressed at first          \n\n Spayed/neutered:   YES\n\n Up-to-date on routine vaccinations:   YES\n\n Microchipped:  NO but a chip will be provided\n\n Social with other dogs:  YES but she is selective about her friends and not all other dogs are tolerant of her unfiltered energy.  Slow, proper introductions to any new dogs is a MUST with her.  She does not do well with smaller dogs.\n\nSocial with cats: NO CATS \u2026 she plays far too rough and has a high prey drive\n\nGood with children:  Her energy may be overwhelming for small children.  Will be better with children 12 years old and up\n\nAdoption donation: $175\n\nWe are an all-volunteer group, so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions and home visits.  You can expedite the process by providing accurate email addresses for all your references.  Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have multiple applications in process.  We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if Mango picks you too. \n\nIf it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee, and an adoption contract to be signed. \nPlease feel free to email weluvpups@hotmail.com if you have additional questions.",

If you find a dog you want to meet in person, please go to www.secondchancedogrescue.org and complete an application. We will make every attempt to process all applications within 3 business days of receipt.\n\n// //\n\nSingle curmudgeon canine male with managed medical issue is seeking a single caring human female of means for companionship and to assist with simple daily canine care. If you are still reading this then please read on about me!\n\nMeet Macaroni, or Mac for short. Mac is a loving and loyal nine year old, 14 pound Chihuaha. He is a little bit shy at first but in his foster's home Mac has blossomed into a relaxed and loving companion. Mac will pick one person to be \"his person\", and really does prefer women. Macaroni walks well on a leash, is crate trained, and is doing very well with his house training and will use pee pads. He appreciates having a comfy safe spot of his very own to retreat for reflection and a good nap. At night, he is expert at burrowing under the covers to sleep at your feet. Mac is good with other friendly dogs, and respectful of the foster's dog-tolerant cat. He would do best in a female household without small children or lots of visitors. Mac travels in a car okay, but he would not be a good long-distance or airplane traveler.\n\nMacaroni loves a good cuddle on the couch, knows how to be a good companion without going over the top, and would be a good friend for life! Macaroni is neutered, microchipped and current on his vaccines. Mac is on medications to prevent seizures which is required three times daily according to schedule. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nAll Second Chance Dog Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, are up to date on vaccines and have microchips prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption fees vary depending on age of dog. Fees help Second Chance Dog Rescue cover spay/neuter costs,\n\nvaccinations, medical treatments,\n\nfood and supplies. Please go to\n\nwww.secondchancedogrescue.org\n\nand complete an application today!\n\nAll dogs live in private foster homes until they are adopted.",

            "description": "Hi \u2026 my name is Joy and here are some things you need to know about me:\n\nCan you believe I was in 'doggy jail'?  I think I had a family once, but no one came to find me.  Foster Mom says 'It's their loss' ... whatever that means.  I try to be a very good girl, and most of the time I do OK, but sometimes I get really rowdy when I have other rowdy friends to play with.  And cats just bring out the worst in me.  Sorry.  Do you have room in your family for me?\n\nThis sweet girl is so much fun to be around.  She\u2019s playful, sweet, snuggly, loveable \u2026 and some days she even listens well.  She\u2019s a very smart girl and learns quickly.  She has a little shar-pei stubborn streak but she really does care whether her people are happy or not ... until she sees a cat ... or a squirrel ... or a deer ... anything that feels she must chase and eliminate.  She\u2019s good with her foster siblings \u2026 especially loves playing with a puppy that looks like her little doppleganger!  She\u2019s pretty even-tempered but she could definitely hold her ground if somebody else started something.  An experienced dog person and some obedience classes will do wonders to polish up this diamond-in-the-ruff!\n\nApproximate age/birthdate:  born ~2014\n\nWeight/size: 45 lbs\n\n Housebroken:  YES\n\n Crate trained:  YES \u2026 but she HATES being crated and will be very vocal about it\n\n Personality: happy, sweet, loving, playful\n\nEnergy level:  medium/high \u2026 she\u2019s part lab so she\u2019s a perpetual puppy\n\nFenced yard required?:   YES (no exceptions) \u2026 she needs a place to safely run and play off-leash to work off energy and she has a very high prey drive.  She will run off chasing deer, rabbits, squirrels ... the neighbor's cats ... etc.  \n\nDoes he/she jump fences?  NO\n\nLeash walk:  YES\n\nObedience training:  Knows \u2018sit\u2019 \u2026 she\u2019s very smart and learns new things quickly\n\n Riding in vehicles:  RIDES OK      \n\n Spayed/neutered:   YES\n\n Up-to-date on routine vaccinations:   YES\n\n Microchipped:   YES\n\n Social with other dogs:  YES \n\n Social with cats:  NO CATS ... she has a high prey drive and will do harm to cats\n\nGood with children:  Children over 10.  Her size and energy might prove to be too much for younger children.\n\nAdoption donation:  $175\n\nIf you think Joy might be the perfect pup for you, please go to www.allamericanmuttrescue.org, click on Forms/Application and complete your adoption application online.\n\nWe are an all-volunteer group, so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions and home visits.  You can expedite the process by providing accurate email addresses for all your references.  Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have multiple applications in process.  We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if Joy picks you too.\n\nIf it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee, and an adoption contract to be signed.\n\nPlease feel free to email weluvpups@hotmail.com if you have additional questions.\n",

I had really bad mange but my foster has since fixed me all up and made me better. I love to play with big and small dogs but I'm not sure about cats, as  I've never been around them. I need a family that will be patient and understanding, as I can take a little bit to warm up to meeting new people and would probably do best in a home without small children. I'm looking for my forever family a home to call my own. Someone to love me unconditionally forever and ever. Could You Be the One?\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

            "description": "Meet Bo Dewey \u2013 It's been a whole YEAR since this boy was adopted and unfortunately he is being returned to rescue due to a divorce. . He\u2019s approx. 4 years old, up to date on all vaccines and neutered.\n\u00a0\nBo is a big, goofy, cuddly boy who loves to play and make everyone laugh. He was very appropriate with his human foster sisters and takes great correction from their female dog while he was in foster.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBo is house trained and crate trained. A home with a fenced in yard and experience with large dogs is preferred as he\u2019s a BIG, strong boy. Bo does not do well with cats or animals smaller than him, they confuse him. He will also need his training to be kept up on, which is going great! He's learning to focus and not be so excitable all the time. If anyone is interested, we have videos of Bo playing the foster\u2019s children. He loves being outside, whether it's a baby pool or running in the snow\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this big boy - please submit your application today! \nhttps://queencitypitties.com/adoption-application/",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hopper is now almost 5 years old and remains in a foster home where she is very comfortable and settled. Hopper remains 'Hopperish' - she has bursts of extreme energy which consists of jumping and pawing, followed by typical greyhound settled behavior. Hopper continues to love stuffies and her food, and is clean in the house. Hopper is sometimes wary of people and can be growly towards the other dogs in her foster home. Original PostingM's Free Hopper is a very pretty little girl. She is friendly and playful when she feels comfortable and secure. She likes to snuggle and to bury her head into your lap or legs. She walks very nicely on leash. Hopper likes people and other dogs. This 2 year old is a sibling to Free Business 'Billy' and Free Dara. She turned 2 in August and is cat tolerant with supervision.Foster Update 6/26/2017\nHopper will be 4 years old in August, 2017 and is currently in a foster home. She is a unique greyhound girl who is active and interactive. She loves her stuffy toys, is a good eater and is housebroken. Hopper is often very enthusiastic and would do best in a home without small children. Hopper at times can be growly with the other dogs, so close supervision is required. She requires a calm, authoritative owner who can deal with Hopper at her best (and sometimes worst).\nOriginal Foster Update: Free Hopper is looking out for her forever home. She is not only beautiful but so very sweet. She is very well behaved and gets along with my 4 cats and her small dog friends. She loves belly rubs and has the most adorable little hop when excited. She also smiles when happy.\nInmate Handler Update 1/13/2016:'Hopper is a very interesting girl. She is loving and thinks that she is a princess and can also sometimes be a little bossy. Her personality is one of a kind. Not only that but her coat has a very black sheen to it that gleams when in the light. A coat that is also very soft and a delicate frame. Hopper is great on the leash and does not use the bathroom indoors and loves to play.'M's Free Hopper is back with GFNJ as it was just not a good match. She is in a foster home and doing just great. She's young and learns quickly. She ignores the cats in the foster home, has easily mastered the stairs, crates easily, has no space issues and corrects very easily with a firm 'Hey'.This young 2 year old is looking for her forever home.",

            "description": "Say Hello to Gunner!\n\nGunner is a 1.5yr old English Bulldog and weighs about 40lbs. He has a condition called Spina Bifida and it will require him to wear diapers for the rest of his life. However, it doesn't keep him from being a regular dog who enjoys walks and play time with his people. He also does well with older children. When not playing, his favorite place to be is right next to you on the sofa for snuggles. He is such a cuddle bug! And who can resist that face?\n\nGunner wants all of the attention and lovin' for himself and needs to be an only dog. He is currently being fostered with our trainer in Denver. But he would love a home of his very own where he can watch movies on the sofa and run around in the backyard. \n\nHis adoption includes the following training:  3 in home sessions (the first being when he is brought to his forever home). 2 six week classes (basic obedience & intermediate obedience) and unlimited play groups for 3 month.\n\nSee more Gunner pics on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/moemoesrescue/photos/pcb.853437715041129/853437175041183/?type=3&theater\n\nApply to adopt Gunner at http://www.moemoesrescue.com/",

            "description": "Rocky, a Lab/Staffie mix born July 2016, is looking for a new home with people who will love and understand him. Although he has had a rough start to life, with the right training and positive reinforcement, this boy will be a faithful companion. He will come with training so we can be sure he will live a great life and you will be equipped to deal with and learn all about how to help him gain confidence. In his previous home, Rocky was severely abused and ended up in the shelter. That environment was not conducive to helping him heal so we worked together to get him into a loving home where he could learn all about people and learn to trust them. He will need the proper introduction with all resident dogs and children over the age of 12 to ensure a great long-term relationship. Young children prove to be too unpredictable for Rocky, so we are recommending no children or children over the age of 12. Rocky has so much potential to be the most loving companion with the right family. He will thrive most in a home with a fenced in yard so he can have space when he needs it and a family that is experienced with dogs.\n\nRocky needs time to feel safe with new people. Interested adopters should expect a few meetings for Rocky to get to know them. A trainer will be a part of the process to help Rocky and his new owners work well together.\n\nUpdate from foster 12/26/18: Rocky is a big sweetheart that shows his best self in environments where he feels safe and relaxed. Having struggled with fear and anxiety around strangers and loud noises, Rocky has come a long way and enjoys going on outings and doesnt mind the vacuum as much anymore. He knows sit, shake and lie down and comes when hes called. He is well house-trained and does well in a crate. He loves his squeaky toys and enjoys a good game of fetch with them. Rocky may need some time to warm up to you, your kids or other dogs. If those around him are calm and patient, he will more likely feel safe. When that happens, he will be your biggest fan.\n\nBefore applying to adopt Rocky, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Rocky is $350, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals inthe home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Rocky into your home, please begin by submitting our AdoptionApplication. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha,\nNE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com.

            "description": "SPONSORED - ADOPTION FEE WAIVED! Oh my! We have a beauty for you with gray and gorgeous Gemma! Our gal has waited a long time to find you. We rescued Gemma with her newly born litter of puppies after they ended up in a high intake shelter. Of course, Gemma was a wonderful mom and now that all of her puppies have been adopted, she's dreaming of a forever home for herself! Large at 83 pounds, Gemma is sturdy and has lots to love on.  With all Gemma has been through, she is a little nervous upon introductions, but the more she trusts, her sweetness begins to blossom.  When we first rescued Gemma, she was afraid to be outside, but now she enjoys being outside and rolling around in the grass. Gemma needs someone with lots of love to give and patience.  Gemma is crate trained. Gemma is a laid back gal and friendly. Her lazy personality will have you finding her snoozing close to you. She does need to be in a home without cats. Gemma is just waiting to browse through adoption applications at ITVRescue.org. Gemma has a guardian angel who sponsored her adoption fee so her adoption fee is waived! Gemma is just a big love bug who needs an easy going home to live out the leisurely life she so deserves! She can't wait to become part of your family and be homeless no more! See video of Gemma at https://www.facebook.com/courtney.kniese/videos/2119146291438567/\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

This sassy, good looking, six year old boy is ready to share life's adventures with you.  \n\nDisplaced through no fault of his own, Red is house trained, knows lots of commands like sit, down, roll-over and shake and is excited to keep learning, especially if some tasty treats are involved. This playful pup is eager for a loving home with an experienced owner who will consider him as part of the clan and provide plenty of outdoor exercise time (fetch is the best!) and plenty of indoor time to just hang out with the humans. Red is looking for a family with no other animals, as he is picky when choosing his canine friends and thinks cats are for chasing. If you are looking for a partner in cuddling and fun, then Red's your guy!  \n\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING - This dog is not in foster care with BAPBR and we make no guarantees about his/her health or temperament. We are providing a service to Tillamook Animal Shelter to help with adoption. Please contact the shelter directly if you are interested in meeting or adopting this dog - their info is below.\n\nAdoption Fee: $175\n\nTillamook Animal Shelter is located on the Oregon Coast in Tillamook, Oregon.\nShelter visits are by appointment only.

            "description": "MEET LAYLA 4!! **Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\nMeet Layla! Layla was adopted from a high kill shelter on May 5th 2018. Her adopter was looking for a companion dog for her dog, and it seemed like a great fit. Unfortunately when they got home Layla showed some severe resource guarding issues. Her adopter worked with her for months, and has got it about 80% under control. However there are still some random acts of aggression between Layla and the adopters dog, which results In Layla being kenneled while her owner is gone to work, which isn't fair to such a sweet dog. Layla is super sweet with people doesn't have a mean bone in her body towards humans, and you can truly tell all she wants is love and affection. Layla has most likely had a rough past. She was adopted and returned to the shelter 3 times, which is why her current owner will not just dump her back there. She is looking for the perfect home for this well deserving dog.\n\nWe believe Layla is about 3 - 5yrs old. She is spayed, house trained, doggy door efficient, and kennel trained. She is very calm and mellow. Loves water, and loves to snuggle humans. She smiles when she petted or given attention, she loves treats and chew toys and bones. She is the perfect low maintenance companion. She has come such a long way since she escaped the shelter for the last time, and she is looking for her perfect forever home. I cannot stress enough how amazing sweet this pup is. Guaranteed to melt your heart with her loving cuddles. , , Layla is dog tolerant, but wouldn't be able to be left unsupervised with other dogs. She loves puppies she has some motherly instincts, so she may have been a mom before. She is good with older kids and maybe younger, given the proper introduction. She may do okay with a cat given the right introduction, but has never been around them. Come meet her today and see if shes the right fit for your family.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

All Inquiries Require an Adoption Application to be Submitted  \n\nMeet Snuggles,\nRescued by the Police from an unfit home situation and turned over to JCCARE. Snuggles is learning to be loved and pampered in a home.\nSnuggles is shy and timid. Her name is misleading as she does not like to be snuggled.\n She is unsure of everyday things most dogs don\u2019t even notice.\nShe is afraid of loud noise, quick movements and sometimes hesitates to go through an open door. Her foster family has to find her and try to pick her up (sometimes she runs & hides) to go outside often.\nShe has learned how to use potty pads but still hesitates to go outside.\nShe is still learning to trust & enjoy the humans in his foster home, Sometimes wagging her tail and sometimes hiding.\n \nHer future:\nA quiet family that will allow Snuggles to be loved on her terms. \nAt this point Snuggles does not really enjoy sitting and cuddling on a lap but does enjoy being pet if not held. (sometimes) Things may change as she adjusts to home life but for now \nSnuggles will need the following:\nA home on the quiet side.\nA home with adults only.\nA home with a secure fenced yard as Snuggles does not walk on leash and is terrified of the leash.\nA home with another well manured, well-adjusted, small dog to help her overcome her emotional anxiety.\nA home that is financially secure to care for her medical needs.\n\n**Due to her arthritis in her back she should not jump down from furniture or be expected to take long walks / runs. This is a lifelong condition that will require anti-inflammatory/pain medication during \"flare ups\", Flares can be triggered for no obvious reason or due to weather or activity.\n** Due to her dry eyes snuggles will require daily prescription medication for the rest of her life. This will require veterinarian  prescription eye drops administered in both eyes 2-3 times a day. \n\nWould you like to give sweet Snug Bug a forever home? \nPlease fill out the adoption application from our website and someone will contact you with more information about Snuggles.\n\nLOCAL ADOPTION ONLY. ( no further than 50 miles from 60451)\n\n\nWWW.Japanesechinrescue.org\n\nAdoption Process: To adopt a Chin from JCCARE, start by filling out the application found on our website at www.japanesechinrescue.org. The application is under the Forms menu.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t ready to adopt yet but would like to help this dog, please click on the purple SPONSOR ME button above the name.   Your donation will help us to pay for the care of this dog until he/she finds a furever home.\n\nJCCARE also maintains the lives of many senior and special needs Chin in our \u201cSanctuary\u201d program.  These dogs are not listed on petfinder, as their health issues make them unlikely to ever be adopted.   If you are a lover of the breed, could you please consider sponsoring one of our seniors?   You can find their pictures and stories under OUR CHIN on our web site: www.japanesechinrescue.org",

I have  a lot of energy . \n    I love people and love to explore especially wood piles, they are my specialty, if there is any creature in there I will find it! \n     Altho I only weigh 26 pounds, I  am very tall and look bigger! I can run and leap and jump and keep up with much larger dogs and like to have a lot of things to do , otherwise I will go to the door and jump up like a pogo stick until I get to go out, however I can be tempted by a nice chew toy..... . \n     A fenced yard is a must, as I like to spend a lot of time outside. I would be great at dog sports like agility. I am very smart!!! and easily motivated by food. I love to go for walks and meet new people and see new things, and I am very curious and interested in things and not afraid of anything. I love going to the park and to Lowe's and Tractor Supply where I have lots of friends. Are we a match?",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Gender: Male Estimated Date of Birth: January 12, 2017 Size: 53 lbs Location: Dallas, GA\nRESCUING DECKER\nOne of the shelter workers at Dekalb sent out a plea for Decker. She had a soft-spot for his sweet nature and desperation for affection. Decker was at the shelter for 2 weeks with clear neurological issues causing his balance to be off and he tumbled over constantly. He was in need of vet care and we were able to get him what he needs.\nABOUT DECKER\nAlthough Decker cannot walk very far without falling over, he is super sweet and dog friendly. He saw Dr Parks at GVS and his issues are definitely cerebral. A blood test revealed Decker has Cerebellar Ataxia (NCL-A) which is an autosomal recessive neurological disease. His balance and vision will progressively get worse. Decker has to be supported 100% by a person in order to walk. He has a full body harness to make it a little bit easier, but when he's indoors, he is happy to sit on the couch with you. When he is supported by his harness and his person, he loves being outside and loves to 'chase' squirrels (we just walking him where he wants to go and let him pretend). His crate needs to be padded because of his involuntary jerking motions that cause him to sway from side to side and fall over into the crate walls. He is crate-trained, but does not have access to roam freely in the house at this time. He is currently located at the Pit Bull Palace where there is not a space customized to suit his needs to prevent him from injuring himself. Decker needs time to warm up to new people and is not suited for a home with kids. He truly relies 100% on people and would love a foster or adopter that is willing and able to accommodate his special needs.\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

Luckily for me, Rescue came and got me out of there before I ran into trouble.  Whew!  Not a fun place.  I was lucky to go into foster care but my foster dad moved and now I'm back at the kennel.  I am good with pretty much all dogs, altho perhaps not with tiny dogs, since I have retained the pointer hunting traints .I am a well behaved boy .. know my house manners, ride nicely in the car (I do love to stick my head out the window), and walk reasonably well on leash.  I love to hunt lizards so some property i would have space to hunt lizards would be great.   I am a very social boy and  I would not like living alone and not having my family or friends around.  I'm a strong dog consistent with my lab genes and would be best with an experienced dog owner.   I would be great with an active family who hikes bikes jogs or runs or is involved in other outdoor activities where a friendly big dog can join in.  I am neutered (I came into the shelter that way) and vaccinated.  I would so love to have my own family to love .. could it be yours?\n\nIf you are interested in me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by emailat dalrescue@sbcglobal.net. and ask about me.    To ensure I would be a good fit with your family, Rescue requires the completion of an adoption questionnaire, but once approved, arrangements can be quickly made for you and your family to come meet me and my friends at the kennel where I live.  I love meeting new folks so please contact Dalmatian Rescue and ask about me as soon as you can.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on our facebook page at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love seeing your photos and posts about life with your spotty friends so please keep them coming.  Thanks!",

He is a goofball all around and will love being with someone who enjoys life in the same way. Bugsy is full of life and love! ??\n\nBugsy is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and flea and tick treated. He is also crate trained and potty trained and ready for love!!! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Bugsy please email us at: findingabestfriend@gmail.com and ask for an application! \n",

She had no manners whatsoever...so much energy and no idea how to use it.  \n\nIn the short month Lily has been with us, she has crate trained herself, learned sit and down like a pro, is loose leash walking, learned to play fetch, and discovered the joys of a puppy pool.  \n\nThis young girl is gorgeous, smart and wants nothing more than to please you.  Lily will need an active household and someone who will continue working with her on basic obedience and will help her find jobs to keep her little mind and body busy. \n\nLilly will need an experienced dog owner, one that is confident, consistent, and can give her the guidance she needs to grow into the best dog she can be.\n\nIf interested in Lily, head to our website (http://lifelongfriends.org/adoptions) and fill out an adoption application!\n\n",

He is a pup to Bailey, and is thought to be a Heeler/Pointer mix. He was born in June 2018. Jack M did have an unfortunate incident during birth - his toes were torn off--but that doesn't bother Jack M from being fully mobile as he loves to race around with his foster siblings! He is a sweet and playful boy! Jack M is fearful of new people, dogs and situations and needs a lot of space as he doesn't like to feel closed in. It takes him some time to adjust and warm up to new things in his life. For that reason, a quiet, adult only home away from the hustle and bustle of a city is best for Jack M. If you are that special someone who can open their heart to Jack M and continue to work with him on realizing that the world and people can be good, please apply online to adopt Jack M at http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

Im a 2 year old female Dutch Shepherd mix and Im completely star-struck by you and ready to join your pack. I am easy going and loving like a Gemini so you and I can cuddle on the couch on those cold evenings. Im well-disciplined and dependable like Capricorn so you dont have to worry about me destroying the house and yes, I am house-trained. Im fun and adventurous like Leo so lets take car trips as often as we can, I love the car and will behave inside it. Im brave and confident like Aries so I will protect you from the things I dont get along with namely small dogs and cats, but I would be best suited as an only dog. Im can be a little stubborn like the bull Taurus so lets make a date night out of some obedience training, I need help on the leash. You may not know this, but the Zodiac was originally created as a system to measure time and its about time for me to find the furever home with the six-foot fence Ive been dreaming of. If you can give me that then Ill give you all the love in the heavens. \n\n*BSL Restrictions apply, must own home & cannot live in a breed restricted area.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

See I\u2019m not very fond of others, they make me nervous.  I love my foster mommy, she gives me kisses, belly rubs, treats every day, and even hangs out with us and watches tv.  \n\nIf you want to come read to me, see if we may be a match let the wonderful people at MHCR know.  If not it\u2019s okay, like I said they take great care of me and I even have a bunch of new friends.  \n\nI\u2019ve We don\u2019t get the chance to meet, You can help by sponsoring me and all us old timers here, Monetary donations are nice but they always need used or gently used towels, rub a dub dub!  Paper towels, bleach, I love Science Diet small bites, and oh yea, those soft doggy treats.  \n\n- - Manning - - \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application, once submitted we will contact you for a meeting.  Also, we only adopt young puppies out of area once they reach 10 weeks old.  OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS: We do allow out-of-state adoptions for dogs, however, the adopter MUST pay for all transportation fees.  NOTE: As we believe proper healthcare of one's pet is a requirement of good ownership, MHCR only adopts out dogs that have been fully vetted and altered. ADOPTION FEE: (includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, medicines and medical procedures, if necessary) Please LIKE and share our Facebook page www.facebook.com/missyshavencr Thanks!\n\nPlease apply http://www.missyshavencr.org if you are interested in adopting from Missy\u2019s Haven Canine Rescue.

Clearly looked like he was someone's bait dog and was thrown away when they were finished with him. She nursed him back to health and showed him how to trust again. Rocky has lots of energy and just loves everyone. Can be dog selective so would do best with submissive dogs and slow intros only. If interested in meeting Rocky please fill out an application first at fureverfriendz.org to be considered. Rocko's adoption fee is $200. \nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccines, micro chipped, heartworm negative unless otherwise noted, de wormed, current on heartworm and flea prevention.\n",

            "description": "Brigitta is a 8 year old German Shepherd. She is a sweet and loving dog that loves to go for walks, play frisbee, and lounge in her pool. She's very smart and knows basic commands such as sit, down, wait, shake, and touch. She does have anxiety and would benefit from a calm environment with no children or pets. She has paperwork from the breeder, vet records, and she is microchipped. Brigitta has recently started to show some pain in her hips which could possibly be arthritis. She is currently on a joint supplement which seems to help. Brigitta's perfect home will be with a person who will respect her boundaries. It should be a low-traffic, quiet home with no children, no other pets, and few visitors.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Brigitta is $150, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Brigitta into your home, please begin by submitting our Adoption Application. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com.

Classic coloring, eyes that look into your heart, and a megawatt smile,\n\n Chloe is ready to find her happily ever after. \n\nChloe's perfect day consists of easy walks, some playtime, and lots of cuddle time with her person. She's the perfect TV buddy! \n\nChloe does not like to share her things, so an experienced person who understands when to leave her alone is needed. She will warn you, but what's hers is hers.\n\n Chloe knows 'sit' and 'high five', and happily shows off her skills in exchange for a treat which she gently takes. \n\nChloe loves children (older children suggested), gets along with cats, and can be dog selective.\n\n Our superstar is housetrained, crate trained, and looking for a person to provide structure, routine, and guidance to be the best she can be. She's such a love, and is move-in ready, \n\nup to date with vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.\nLet's get her home!\n\n Please fill out this application by copying and pasting the link into your browser\n\nhttps://poshpetsrescueny.org/dog-application/",

He is not a fan of the kennel, but does well in a yard and is calm once he is comfortable with his settings. Frankie was born in 2017. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

That doesn't slow her down and she's surprisingly speedy in her wheel chair.\nShe loves to play with her dog friends (Strange dogs worry her so she needs a calm introduction before deciding that they are friends) and she loves to go for nature walks (runs) on a trail in the woods.\nSasha requires a daily bath as she does not have control of her bathroom functions. Wearing diapers is not a solution for Sasha though she can wear one for an hour or so while she plays on the floor.\nSasha gets an exercise time twice a day (at least) in her wheels. She will need a fenced yard so she can have the freedom to run and explore to her heart's content. She is strongly bonded to her foster mom and we expect she'll feel the same way about a family she chooses to adopt.\nCaring for Sasha is extremely rewarding and requires dedication and commitment. There is nothing like seeing her jump up and down, asking to be picked up when she knows it's time to get in her wheels. Sasha is a great communicator and she expresses her gratitude by looking right into your eyes and smiling.\nThis pup does not have control of bathroom functions.  Baths will be required daily and Living area will have to be created, such as in a play pen where there is soft bedding that can be changed out  couple times a day.\nTo meet Sasha, apply at emotionalrescuemn.org.",

They were homeless and living out of their owners car when he finally decided surrendering them to us would be best, besides all this They both have such vibrant and silly personalities.Fancy is a very simple girl; her favorite things include: toys, water, being pet, treats and of course her brother. She enjoys walks but mostly likes being out in the yard by your feet as you pet her and watch her brother play. We want nothing more than the best for this girl, please consider making her a part of your family. Fancy is not good with any other animals besides Puggy.",

She had a stroke a while back, but she hasn't let it slow her down much. She is still active and enjoys getting out for (short) walks. Dana is a 30-pound terrier mix. She is looking for a retirement home with lots of love, belly rubs and treats. Come meet Dana and make her part of your family!\n\nFrom Dana\n I\u2019m a little bit of a chunky monkey, no fat shaming please. But seriously, I\u2019ve been eating my feelings a little while I\u2019ve been waiting at the shelter. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time and have never had a family of my own. I\u2019ve gotten to be a little old lady and am looking for a soft place to sleep and someone to snuggle with in the evenings. Maybe we can couch potato a little together? You can pick the movie. Just come pick me up first. \nI have very low exercise requirements.  I am not an escape artist as it\u2019s hard for me to jump or get into other kinds of trouble.  I am however, very much into guarding my human companion so I do not like other dogs or cats..but humans, love humans and just want to snuggle with my very own person.\nLove,\nDana",

Please email dogkennel@rbari.org to arrange for one of the people who he trusts to introduce you to him if you think he might be the dog for you.\n \nKinchley is a short squishy-faced little bully boy with some boxer, bulldog, or Boston in him to give him that unique \"smile\". He was adopted from our shelter as a puppy to a home that ended up not being a good fit for him, and our staff and trainers are working hard to socialize him and get him used to new people and situations, and being handled. He gets nervous in a lot of situations and takes time to form a bond, but once he decides you are his friend his silly playful side comes out- on his terms only though! He needs his space and someone who understands his grumpy moody side and when he needs his \"alone time\"\n\n Kinchley needs a dog-savvy adult home who understands his quirks and attitude...please email dogkennel@rbari.org if you would like to truly make a difference in the life of a dog who really needs a home Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Weight: 27lbs Age: 4yrs 7mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

Sorry, no exceptions.\n\n**\n\nAdoption begins with a Foster-To-Adopt period.\n\n**\n\nPaisley is *extremely* intelligent, and needs active, Heeler-savvy humans and another active, playful same-size or larger dog in the home. She loves to run and play, and needs a large fenced yard. We think she could flourish in a ranch/hobby farm environment.\n\nPaisley requires an adults-only home. She has very definite preferences in humans, and she will appreciate smart, kind, playful guardians and dogs her size or larger. She will NOT do well in a home where there are frequent human visitors. She requires slow and repeated introductions to new humans before she can trust them. Prey drive and the tendency to \"herd\" makes her a better candidate for larger animals - no cats or small dogs, please.\n\nIf you believe you're a possible match for Paisley PLEASE complete an adoption application! Please describe your experience raising and training Heelers, and any experience you may have with the above-mentioned dog sports! Thank you!\n\nWe encourage you to register on our site and \"Favorite\" the dog(s) that interest you, so that you will be notified when bio, photos, or status are updated.\n\n\t\"Companion animal\" means, needs at least one other friendly, playful dog that lives full-time in the same household.\n\t\"Fenced yard\" means, a backyard that is adjacent to and connected with your residence. (It does not mean a nearby fenced area/dog park.)\n\tGates must have padlocks and thresholds (cement or buried pavers to prevent digging.)\n\tYard and patio must be free of debris and have room for dogs to run and play *on a lawn and/or in a very shaded area.* Please do not invite us to your home if you have not yet landscaped your yard!\n\t\"Swimming pool\" means a private, in-ground, year-round pool that is available to the dog daily or multiple times per week.\n\tWe do not place dogs in situations where there are \"drained\" or empty swimming pools, which are a fall hazard and contribute to the propogation of mosquitos.\n\tLast and not least, we DO NOT adopt to students as we have found that they often do not know or anticipate where life will take them.\n\nDiscussion about a dog - including scheduling of a home check or other dialogue - cannot occur until we have received your completed adoption application. NO EXCEPTIONS. Thank you!\n\n2/2/21 12:34 PM",

I ended up in the pound with my sister when I was just a little pup. We both were skinny and had skin problems . This confused me so much. Why didn't my people come and get me? I was so scared and sad. The FOF saved me and got me out of there. Because of being so scared though I developed separation anxieties. I barked & tried to get out of rooms and crates if left alone. Sometimes I destroyed carpet or furniture. I went thru several foster homes & then was boarded at the vets. But guess what?! I got another chance and went to another foster home. She understood I needed love and training. I have come along way now. I'm just about a whole year old now I get along with other dogs,cats,though I like to try to play and chase them for fun. I love people. I still don't like to be left in a closed room by myself for long periods of time. l like to think there is someone wonderful out there who would give me the perfect home.\"\n We would still prefer a home for Jack without Cats or small children. He is going to make a great companion to someone who is patient with him and willing to have his adjustment period into their home. He needs a fenced yard or a country home so he can be able to have outside time.  His foster home now even leaves him loose in her house while she is at work. He is great with other playful dogs but he does think all the toys are his. Jack is $100 fully vetted and chipped. Higginsville Mo. Please call and leave a message or text  us and we will get back with you!",

We would not allow them to be split up, they love each other too much!!  Hallie and Harper were found outside our gate one hot July morning, with a sorry, itty bitty bowl of water left for this helpless mother and daughter.  SHAME ON WHOEVER ABANDONED THESE TWO DARLING LOVE-FILLED CREATURES.  Anyway, they are just a delight.  Mother Hallie is about 60 pounds (although she looks more like a 50-pound dog, she just must be solid muscle under her beautiful fur).  Little Harper grew up, but stayed pretty little.  She is about 30 pounds and she is her full size.  They play and play and play all day long.  Harper is like a pesky little rambunctious daughter, and Hallie is the loving and patient mother.  They get along great with just about all other dogs.  These two are an automatic family of joy, ready to come into your family.  What could be better than this adorable package deal???\n",

            "description": "Name: Diesel\nBreed: American Staffordshire Terrier \nAge: Approx. 4 Years\nSex: Male\nWeight: Approx. 65 lbs\nGood with Dogs: Yes, although no small dogs, Diesel prefers laidback females his size.\nGood with Cats: No\nGood with Kids:  Yes\nHeartworm Status:  Negative\n\nDiesel is a great boy that has had a hard past and has persevered through it all. Diesel originally came to us after our staff arrived for work one morning and found Diesel tied to our gate. Without a note, and no information on his past, all that we know about Diesel\u2019s past is that he was absolutely heartbroken when he arrived, and missed his people very, very much. After undergoing heartworm treatment and having to learn how to handle being crated, Diesel has waited for his forever family and is ready to go home.\n\nDiesel walks great on a leash. He is very smart and likes to go shopping. He really loves sunbathing, and being outside. He has a thing for toys and likes to chase squeaky toys and tennis balls especially. He is housebroken and rides great in a car. \n\nDiesel is not a fan of small creatures likes cats or small animals and will give chase. Diesel prefers laidback, non-dominant females. While he isn\u2019t really the kind of dog that would do well at a dog park, Diesel is the kind of boy that knows what it\u2019s like to have people love him and just wants a chance to have a forever family that won\u2019t abandon him for reasons he can\u2019t understand. \n\n\n------\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nHOW TO APPLY: If you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "Hold \nLooking for a well behaved, gentle, trained companion dog that is good with young children? Meet Jack. He enjoys walks, snuggling, car rides, playing with toys, enjoys being close with his owner. \n\nJack is a 10 year old, retired plantation hunting dog, approximately 55 pounds, heartworm negative on monthly preventative, and up to date on shots. He was neutered in August 2018 and microchipped. \n\nOriginally from Oklahoma, currently living and a foster family in north western Pennsylvania, Jack has adjusted to the snow belt well. He can be tied out briefly to go potty and is not a barker. Jack knows the word no and promptly complies. \n\nHe enjoys going on walks and sticks close to you in the yard. Jack is housebroken, crate trained, and very quiet. He is very quick to catch onto routines, follows them without any instructions, and goes right into his kennel knowing that he\u2019s going to get a yummy treat. \n\nJack should be in a cat free home. If you have another dog, the dog would just have to be chilled and very relaxed - not an Alpha type. A fenced yard would be best to keep Jack safe and give him the freedom to explore, but isn\u2019t absolutely necessary.\n\nIf you are loving, can supply joint supplements, good food, and an orthopedic bed , I will be forever yours. \n\nJack has multiple health issues and will be living out his remaining days in one of our awesome foster homes.  If you would like to help provide care for Jack and other dogs like him, donations are gratefully accepted at http://www.pointerrescue.org/donation.html",

            "description": "Sinbad is a blue merle Catahoula Leopard Dog mix, 7 years old and 60 lbs. He's a big, energetic boy and will need someone strong to handle him. But he also knows some commands, such as \"sit\" and \"give me paw\". He is leash trained. He loves his people.\n\nHe would be great for an active adult family where he's the only dog.\n\nHe will need a secure yard- he's led us on some chases when the gate's been left open!\n\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under \"Adopt a dog\"* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\n\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Chloe is very affectionate and loving girl.  Really, she\u2019s just a big lapdog.  She loves to hang out with her people, cuddle on the couch and play! \n\nChloe is an active dog. One of her very favorite things to do is chase her buddy, Benny around the yard.  She also likes to play her rope toy and squeaky toys.\n\nChloe is house trained and crate trained. She is working on her leash manners.  She is up-to-date on her shots, spayed and heartworm negative.\n\nLikes big boy dogs, not as crazy about females, not good with small dogs.  No cats.\n\nChloe's approx. DOB is 11/15/2014.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted to adoption@pupsquad.org or via the online form. \n\nWe are happy to transport our dogs out-of-state as we have lots of experience doing this and love to see our dogs to the best homes possible! We will assist with the whole process to getting your new pet to you. Feel free to email us regarding availability or any other questions. Please remember all breed estimates are just that...estimations based on our experience. \n\nNOTE: We will only do transport if the dogs are 4 months of age or older as this means they are fully vetted and spay/neutered at this age and ready for transport.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org",

She is fully vetted and ready to adopt. She is a hound mix who can play all day with our dogs, loves water and pools, loves riding in the side by side ATV, and is house broken. Neeka has no experience with small children or cats, and she could use a big yard, because she is  a big girl who needs lots of room to play. Her foster parents love her, but they think it is time for her to get her forever home. \n\n If you are interested, please fill out an online adoption application available on www.goliadpetadoption.net.Or send an inquiry via Petfinder if you have questions.

This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE OPEN HOURS! WE MEET ADOPTERS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY!!!!\nAN ONLINE APPLICATION IS THE FIRST STEP TO MEETING A NEW PET.

She came to us with one pup that was left of her litter after she was dumped in a field in freezing weather.\n\nLady is a love bug who just wants to know her people are nearby. Lady loves her people so much she does not like it when they are gone and has separation anxiety. Someone who is retired, works from home or a stay at home parent would be best for her. She is currently in a home with 3 older dogs, a young human sister and a human brother. Her foster mom is a stay at home mom which Lady LOVES!\n\nLady has allergies so during the spring and summertime she requires a shot every 6-8 weeks to help her with this.\n\nShe also loves her chew toys and her soft, comfy bed. She is house trained and will definitely let you know when she needs to go out! She walks beautifully on a leash and listens to positive reinforcement.\n\nBecause Lady does not like to be crated or left alone, we really want to see her in a forever home with other dogs. She will thrive with an active family who will take her places and go on adventures! Lady loves car rides. The only thing she doesn't like is cats....\n\n**Please note we do not adopt to Canada due to border issues and breed specific legislation.Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: See below.\nReason for being in rescue: Beaux originally came to CPR in 2015 as an owner surrender. He was adopted by a loving family. Unfortunately, Beaux became aggressive toward a small dog in the home and he was returned to CPR in June 2018.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? None noted\nWeight: Est 48 lbs (he's a little chunky)\nHeight: Est 24\" at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Beaux needs a home with experienced owners. He cannot be in a home with small dogs. We have tried him with several large dogs here. He will walk on a leash side by side but when the new dog tries to \"sniff and say hello\" and properly introduce themselves as dogs do, Beaux wants no part of it. A part of the problem is he's so focused on making sure he knows where his human handler is that he does not want the distraction of another dog. Once he feels more secure, he may accept another large dog.\n\nBeaux's new family will need to understand that as a working breed, Beaux needs a job to do. He can't just be a couch potato! A nice big fenced in yard with plenty of open space to run would be just right, but remember that you have to be out there with him. Beaux does not want to run alone. He wants to be with his people and/or in his safe place - his crate.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Beaux is a gorgeous brown and white border collie. He is incredibly friendly to people and thinks they are wonderful. Beaux does have a lot of anxiety in him, anxiety that will temper but not completely alleviate once he is in his new home. He wants a person - he does not have separation anxiety but having someone love him is going to make him happy.\n\nBeaux is so smart, he can actually open doors when the mood strikes him! He enjoys being loved on and running around. He is very mellow in his crate, but Beaux needs space where he can be free to run and enjoy life. He plays fetch and is not aggressive at all when you take the ball back from him. He just wants to be with you. He lets you know when he is ready to rest by nosing the door to go back in.\n\nBeaux is medium energy, depending on what is going on around him. Beaux is not food or crate aggressive to people he knows. A new person needs introduced before they can take the bowl out. A new person becomes a BFF in just a few hours. Simply spend some time with him and you will earn his trust. He is a toy hoarder and he loves anything that squeaks. He is very clean in his crate!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 9/19/2011. Be prepared for a lot of people to tell you what a stunning, beautiful dog you have.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.\n2/2/21 6:21 PM",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Jaycie is one of The Magnificent Seven dogs from a 9,600 acre ranch in the northern-most part of the Texas Panhandle. Like all the others in that group, she spent her life protecting goats, and wasn't ever properly socialized with humans. We have managed to earn her trust, but she is still a little bit shy with strangers. But she's an excellent LGD with our goats, and she gets along with other dogs, as long as they don't pose any threat to the livestock. She ignores our barn cats, but will chase a chicken if one dares to come into her pasture, and I feel sure she would EAT anything she could catch.\n\nJaycie had FHO surgery in April 2019. While the surgery relieved some of her pain, she has never seemed to regain the full range of motion, so she has an odd gait. We give her Adequan injections and pain meds as needed. But overall, for a dog her age, she's doing great. Since she's part of a TEAM of LGDs here at Windsong Ranch, she's not at risk of being harmed by a predator, and her gentle demeanor makes her perfect for staying with the goats while other dogs do perimeter patrols.\n\nWe think Jaycie enjoys feeling like she has a job, but she also seems to enjoy napping on a cushy dog bed in the barn from time to time. If you would like to give her an easy retirement, perhaps protection your small homestead in the company of another LGD, please complete the application on our website -- https://www.bluebonnetrescue.org/info/adoption.",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nLucy has been returned after being adopted for a year and a half.  She is now an adult and weighs 51 pounds.  She is needy for love and togetherness, but takes a while to get acquainted.  When she knows she is safe around a person, she is very loving and attentive.  She is protective of her person.   Lucy was born 4/11/2018.  Lucy will be the perfect pick for a single person, or two adults who have lots of time and love to give.  Her adoption fee is $200.\n\n\nPlease complete and return an application to meet this beautiful girl.  http://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html\n\n Thank you for visiting our site. Please come back often.",

Due to Pixie not being able to provide enough milk for all of the puppies, the puppies were hand fed so that they will start eating and gaining weight and will soon be up for adoption.  By doing this, Pixie was able to be nursed back to health.  Pixie is current on vaccinations, spayed and heartworm negative. All of the pups have now been adopted so now it's Pixie's turn to find a loving home.  She enjoys being outside, she is crate trained and house trained and would love to be with a family that has older children as she does not do well with young children.  She does not do well with other large dogs and has not done well with cats.  \n\nPixie is very smart and learns fast.  She has short hair, weighs about 75 lbs and enjoys running so a home with someone who jogs would be perfect for Pixie.   Pixie needs to be in a one dog home.  Because she likes to run and play, Pixie must be in a fenced yard.  For further information on Pixie, please call our office at 937-450-1227 and talk with Linda, our vet tech.\n",
