Copper is a Bloodhound. He is 31/2yrs old and weighs around 110lbs. \n\nCopper was an owner surrender. His previous owners couldn't provide basic care for him and agreed it would be in his best interest to give him to rescue that could find him a forever home.\n\nCopper is a kind, patient, noble, mild-mannered and lovable dog.  He is all hound and can sing the song of his people.  He can be very boisterous at times, especially if other dogs near by are barking. He enjoys playing outside on pretty days with his buddy Jack.  He has been out and about with other dogs around his size and done well.  He can be pretty energetic outside when out with friends. If he gets a case of the zoomies watch out! You don't want 110lbs of dog running up on you.  Copper can be stubborn from time to time so he needs an owner that will provide consistent training and calm/assertive leadership.  Because Bloodhounds are born to work, Copper will need physical and mental stimulation.  Daily walks or interactive toys and regular play time will keep him from getting bored.  Copper isn't the greatest on a leash if he catches a scent he needs to investigate. He could use some more leash work to master loose leash walking. In general, Copper is a gentle giant who wants to love and be loved.  Copper has been around children 12yrs and up.  He can be cat tested upon request.  He will need an active family with a fenced yard. \n\nCopper is up to date on vaccines, has been tested for heartworm and 5 diseases spread by ticks, was treated for heartworm disease and has gotten a clean bill of health, is neutered and microchipped. Copper is on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nCopper's adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

Dixie is a Dachshund mix.  She turned 10 yrs young on February 1st. Dixie weighs 17lbs.\n\nDixie was a trucking dog.  She traveled the lower 48 for the last 9 1/2 yrs. Her dad lost his job due to covid.  When he finally got picked up by another company they said no dogs allowed in the trucks. He had no choice but to let his beloved Dixie go.  I promised him I'd find her a wonderful home for her to live out her golden years. \n\nDixie is a sweet girl.  She loves to cuddle on the couch and is always up for a Criminal Minds marathon.   She is a typical Dachshund.  Inquisitive, smart, and very engaged.  She is nose to the ground to take in all the smells when she's in a new place.  She obviously rides well and is always up for an adventure.  She can be a little shy at first but warns up quickly.  She's very treat motivated.  Dixie is house (well truck cab) trained.  She doesn't make messes in her kennel but doesn't really care for it and sometimes will bark to show her displeasure when in it.  She really doesn't need it.  She's very well mannered.  Dixie has been around other dogs and has done fine.  She used to have a *sister* that rode in the truck too. She is fine on a leash but does like to investigate everything so she will pull but she's small and easy to control.   Dixie has met the resident cat and was unimpressed.  She's been around children 12 and up.  She's never been around young children.\n\nDixie is fully vetted and up to date on vaccines, she's been tested for heartworms and 5 diseases spread by ticks, is spayed and microchipped.  She had mammary tumors removed at the time of her spay but they were benign.\n\nDixie's adoption fee is $475, which covers all her vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

He arrived at the shelter along with his sisters, Heidi and Kira; who have already been adopted.  Chief is fourteen weeks old and ready to find his new forever home.  This cuddly little teddy bear weighs just twelve pounds but will be a large dog someday.  Sweet, rambunctious and playful, he would make a perfect companion for a family with children.  He needs someone that has the time to raise and train a puppy.  Chief is just beginning to learn his doggie ABC\u2019s and is not housebroken.  A fenced in yard will help with house training and give him a safe place to run and play.  Chief would enjoy having another dog to play with in his new home.  He is also to perfect age to learn to be respectful around cats.  Chief is simply adorable and will make a fabulous family pet.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application.  Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Beanie Weenie! Beanie is an 11 week old Boxer/Lab mix.  He is 15lb. He will be a medium dog full grown. \n\nBeanie was an owner surrender.  Someone got him at 6 weeks old and didn't realize the cost and responsibility involved with raising a puppy. They surrendered him so we can find him a forever home. \n\nBeanie Weenie is a socal and outgoing puppy.  He is friendly and lovable.  He's very intelligent.  He's catching on to house and kennel training. He's playful and loves spending time with his canine foster brothers and sisters.  He enjoys being outside on pretty days.  He doesn't really like being left alone so he'll need an active family that will include him in dog friendly activities. \n\nBeanie is up to date on age appropriate vaccines,  has been tested/treated for intestinal parasites, is neutered and microchipped.  He is on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nBeanie's adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

She is a very sweet girl who has spent the majority of her life not being socialized or had much training so we are working on those things with her, but she gets better every day. She is a precious girl who loves her people and would do best in a calm household with humans that have plenty of time with her. So far she seems to be house trained and will not have accidents in the crate, but she does cry in the crate - something else we are working very hard on. She is a smart girl who loves affection. She does okay with other dogs her size, but doesn't like bigger dogs or high energy dogs in her face.\u00a0\n\nIf interested please visit our website to view the process and fill out an application.

Her previous owner passed away and left her and 6 other dogs with no home and no other family to take care of her.\n\nWe believe she had not been exposed to many people as she is very shy and skittish when meeting someone new.  With lots of treats, love and patience, she does come around and gives you her cute little underbite smile!\n\nShe would be best suited in a home with an owner that has some experience with dogs that are shy and timid.  She gets along great with other dogs and enjoys chasing her buddies around the Foster Mom's yard.\n\nShe is not fully house trained, we are working with her.  If you are interested in Simba, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.\n\nLocal area adoption only.",

Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Nigel! Nigel, Norris and Newt are 10 week old Lab/Collie mixes. They are currently 11-12lbs and will be a medium/large size dogs full grown. \n\nNigel and his brothers were found in an industrial complex in Memphis.  There's nothing but warehouses in that area so the puppies had to have been dumped there.  Luckily a kind security guard found them and got in touch with the rescue to get these pups to safety.  \n\nNigel and his brothers are very friendly.  They are outgoing and social.  They are very active and energetic.  They are super playful and would love an active family that will keep them entertained and engaged in puppy friendly activities.  Nigel and his brothers are doing well in their foster home.  They are learning to be good puppies although the can and will get into puppy mischief if left to their own devices. They are good around other dogs but a but too enthusiastic for the resident chihuahua and cat.   They are 100% puppy and 100% boy! \n\nNigel is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, has been tested for intestinal parasites and has been dewormed, is neutered and microchipped.  He is on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nNigel\u2019s adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Landon Willie\n\nBreed: Dachshund\n\nApproximate Age: 4 yr\n\nGender: Male\n\nWeight: 16 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nLandon Williecame to us all the way from Texas in a snowstorm because he wanted to find a loving home. He had been adopted in Texas but returned after he dug under a fence to chase cats. Because of this, he is looking for a cat free home and one where he will be watched outside so he doesn't dig himself a path to trouble. We do not have any other history or background, so do not know if he is housetrained or lived with other pets or with children. If interested in meeting Landon Willie, please fill out the preadoption application as that is the first step in adoption. If the dog is still listed on the adoptables pages, we are still taking applications.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

            "description": "A recent arrival to our nursery is sweet little Abby, an eleven week old Shepherd mix puppy.  She is growing by leaps and bounds and will be a large dog someday.  Abby is a cute little teddy bear and has a wonderful outgoing personality.  This sweet girl is very affectionate loves to be cuddled.  Like most puppies her age, she is all about play and loves spending time with her toys.  Abby is perfect for a family with children that have time to train a puppy.  She needs daily walks and plenty of exercise.  Another dog in the home would give her a playmate and help keep her entertained.  She is also the right age to teach her to be respectful around cats.  Abby is working on her house manners and will need a fenced in yard.  If you are looking for a puppy to add to your family, Abby will make a wonderful pet.\n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

Another dog and a fenced is required for this boy.\n\nIf interested please visit our website to view the process and fill out an application. W2rescueflorida.org",

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application.  Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Norris! Nigel, Norris and Newt are 10 week old Lab/Collie mixes. They are currently 11-12lbs and will be a medium/large size dogs full grown. \n\nNorris and his brothers were found in an industrial complex in Memphis.  There's nothing but warehouses in that area so the puppies had to have been dumped there.  Luckily a kind security guard found them and got in touch with the rescue to get these pups to safety.  \n\nNorris and his brothers are very friendly.  They are outgoing and social.  They are very active and energetic.  They are super playful and would love an active family that will keep them entertained and engaged in puppy friendly activities.  Norris and his brothers are doing well in their foster home.  They are learning to be good puppies although the can and will get into puppy mischief if left to their own devices. They are good around other dogs but a but too enthusiastic for the resident chihuahua and cat.   They are 100% puppy and 100% boy! \n\nNorris is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, has been tested for intestinal parasites and has been dewormed, is neutered and microchipped.  He is on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nNorris's adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application.  Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Newt! Nigel, Norris and Newt are 10 week old Lab/Collie mixes. They are currently 11-12lbs and will be a medium/large size dogs full grown. \n\nNewt and his brothers were found in an industrial complex in Memphis.  There's nothing but warehouses in that area so the puppies had to have been dumped there.  Luckily a kind security guard found them and got in touch with the rescue to get these pups to safety.  \n\nNewt and his brothers are very friendly.  They are outgoing and social.  They are very active and energetic.  They are super playful and would love an active family that will keep them entertained and engaged in puppy friendly activities.  Newt and his brothers are doing well in their foster home.  They are learning to be good puppies although the can and will get into puppy mischief if left to their own devices. They are good around other dogs but a but too enthusiastic for the resident chihuahua and cat.   They are 100% puppy and 100% boy! \n\nNewt is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, has been tested for intestinal parasites and has been dewormed, is neutered and microchipped.  He is on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nNewt\u2019s adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

            "description": "Lola is approximately 4 years old and 15 lbs.  She came from an outside hoarding situation so she is currently working on her housetraining, leash walking, and enjoying human touch.  We are looking for a patient family with older children or no children, a physical fence, another confident dog, and experience with scared dogs.  These things will help keep her safe and get more comfortable as she learns how to be a companion dog in a home.  This may take month until she is totally comfortable living in a home.  This is a true rescue.\n\nThe adoption fee of $300 includes spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, distemper/parvo combination vaccine, bordetella vaccine, deworming, heartworm test, heartworm preventative, flea preventative, a dental cleaning if necessary, and a microchip.\n\nTo inquire about this dog, please select the Ask About button; include information about your family and pets, what you are looking for in a canine companion, and why this specific dog seems to be a good fit for your family; and then select the Send Email button.  Those who provide the previous information will be considered first for this canine.  We usually respond via email within 24-48 hours; please check your spam folder if you don't hear from us.  Do NOT call our center. \n\nOften there is very little known about our dogs' and puppies' history or even current habits. We are best guessing on breed blends. We can't guarantee there is or isn't a specific breed in their breed blend.\n\nYou can always expect to do training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. Expect a 10+ year financial, physical, and emotional commitment to this canine. We provide a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this. All dogs and especially puppies are a lot of work and a long financial commitment. Please research what it means to have a dog and make sure a dog is still going to be an important part of your life in 10-15 years. All dogs and puppies need a lot of patience and guidance.\n\nMost dogs who are in shelters will need an adjustment period after adoption. No matter how nice our shelter is and how much attention they get from our volunteers, it is not a home and they will need time to acclimate and get rid of some nervous energy.",

His previous owner passed away and left him and 6 other dogs with no home and no other family to take care of him.\n\nWe believe he had not been exposed to many people as he is shy and skittish when he meets someone new.  If you give him lots of treats, some love and patience, he does come around and then wants to jump in your lap!\n\nHe would be best suited in a home with an owner that has some experience with dogs that are shy and timid.  He gets along great with other dogs and enjoys running around the yard with his buddies.\n\nHe is not fully house trained, we are working with him.  If you are interested in Frasier, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.\n\nLocal area adoption only.\n",

I'm Sophie and I\u2019m a new arrival to Providence Animal Center from Pensacola and can\u2019t wait to move from here into my new forever home. My adoption day is all I can think about, please don\u2019t make me wait too long! \n\nThe staff & volunteers are still learning about me, but so far they report that I am about 2 years old, 29 pounds and I'm ready to move into my furever home -- I'm spayed, microchipped and up to date on my vaccinations. \n\nI'm currently staying with fabulous foster family and they report that I am very sweet and active. She loves to play and is a master ball fetcher. She's a fan of stuffed toys, balls, raw hides... pretty much all toys! She is very cautious of new places and things, but I'm have been taking her to different parks/walks which is making her more comfortable. \n\nThe staff feel my ideal home would have another doggie roommate to show me the ropes and help to build my confidence. She would do well in a quiet home, no city life for this girl! \n\nIf you are interested in Sophie, please complete an adoption profile (found here: https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) and email it to foster@providenceac.org. I can't wait to meet you and my new best doggy friend! \n\nTail wags and kisses, \n\nSophie\n\n\n___\n\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n\nPlease note: Some pets are still in fabulous foster homes, so be sure to check the pet\u2019s \u2018location\u2019 in their listing prior to scheduling an appointment. To meet a pet currently in a foster home, follow the instructions listed in their bio. Thank you for your flexibility during this challenging time! We can\u2019t wait to see your masked face!\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n",

He especially enjoys laying right on top of his foster mom\u2019s face. He has so much love to give! \n\nPip\u2019s adorable expression is due to past nerve damage on the one side of his face. This does not affect him; it only makes him unique in his cuteness. Pip is potty trained and will endure a crate (although he doesn't like it).  He\u2019s had a little hair loss, so he doesn\u2019t love the cold. Pip is happy to run outside to go potty, and then race inside for more snuggles. He also looks very dapper in cozy sweaters and jammies. \n\nPip enjoys \"talking,\" so he\u2019d be best in a house as opposed to an apartment or condo. Pip is ready to go home and can't wait to meet his special family!\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $255 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm",

With lots of treats, love and patience, he does come around and then wants to play and jump in your lap!\n\nHe would be best suited in a home with an owner that has some experience with dogs that are shy and timid.  He gets along great with other dogs and has lots of puppy energy.\n\nHe is not fully house trained, we are working with him.

            "description": "Sassy is a 9-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

            "description": "Frannie is a friendly little girl who loves to play with toys and explore her surroundings. She is very happy and affectionate, and loves treats! She also loves going on walks and short hikes with her foster sibling Lloyd (pictured). She would love a medium to high energy family who can take her on outings, hikes, and other outdoor adventures.\n\nFrannie is a dog who thrives on structure. She's very smart and motivated, and will need a strong leader to continue to provide her with the structure she is learning in her foster home. We utilize crate training with her and she needs a set schedule that includes decompressing in her crate. Without structure, she feels afraid and doesn't trust her humans. But, once she feels like she can trust you to give her direction, she is a wonderful and loyal companion. Even better to note is that Frannie is leash-trained, crate-trained, and potty-trained. Frannie is good with other calm, balanced dogs. She's the perfect dog to join your home for the new year! \n\nFrannie is a 3-year-old Chihuahua mix, and weighs 8 pounds. No cats or children under the age of 16. Fill out an application today to meet her!\n\n*Bite Disclosure* Frannie was placed in an uncomfortable setting through no fault of her own and bit a human out of fear. With the proper love, guidance, and training plan (supplied by us), we don't believe she will do this again. She is a wonderful, sweet dog who just needs the right family to see how great she is! We believe in her.",

            "description": "Spooky #7650 is a 5-year-old female Pit Bull mix. She is a well-rounded adult gal. She enjoys her walks 3 times a day. Spooky is housetrained. She enjoys having a toy or treat to chew on. She walks perfectly on the leash. She is good with children. She is also good with other dogs, although she may appear shy at first. If you leave food out on the counter, she will steal it! Every night, she will be in your bed with you, if you let her, either on top of or underneath the covers. Spooky doesn\u2019t like being wet; she does not enjoy the snow or rain. However, she was well-behaved when receiving a bath. She is eager to learn and is treat-motivated. Overall, she is an amazing dog. Spooky is an LCAR momma who came to us with pups in tow. Her pups are ready for homes, and now so is Spooky! She also came to us with heartworms and ehrlichia. We are looking for someone to continue Spooky\u2019s treatment at no additional cost to the adopter. She weighs 58 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities",

He is accepting applications and is being fostered in MD.\n\nWhat Bailey's foster mom has to say about Bailey:\nBailey\u2019s favorite activities are snuggling, sleeping, and snuggling while sleeping. He is an affectionate, 60lb lapdog who could easily win Best Personality. A friend to everyone he meets, Bailey loves people and wants to say \u2018Hi\u2019 to every dog in his neighborhood. He is enthusiastically curious about cats too.\n\nBailey\u2019s life has been difficult but you would never guess that given how outgoing and trusting he is. He is blind in both eyes although he may be able to see shadows. When he first arrived at his foster's house we thought he had neurological damage due to a (very endearing) head tilt and a mild circling gait. Even though a previous vet pointed this out as well, his current vet thinks it could be attributed to musculoskeletal alignment. Growing up, Bailey spent most of his life outdoors, chained to a refrigerator, so his body may have adapted in a way that a visit to the doggie chiropractor can assist with.\n\nHe would be best placed in a house where he won\u2019t be left alone all day. Probably due to his rough past, Bailey suffers from separation anxiety. Living with another dog would probably be a great fit or - better yet- a work-from-home human to lay next to all day. Managing his anxiety will most likely get easier with time; Bailey is a smart guy who is very trainable and has a great memory.\n\nBailey was born to be someone\u2019s dedicated and steadfast companion. He approaches the \u2018man\u2019s best friend\u2019 moniker like it\u2019s his job. He may be blind, but he is very empathetic and senses the kind of friend you need the moment you walk through the door. If you like to cuddle, take meandering walks, charm the pants off people, and - yes- share the warm spot on the couch, then you and Bailey would be a great fit.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

An extremely sweet little lady, she is 16lbs and very well behaved. \n\nMinnie is a little timid at first but once she gains confidence in her new surroundings, she shows her sweet nature. Once she warms up, she will ask for attention, snuggles and enjoys belly rubs. She likes to hang out with her foster parents - she makes funny little noises when she wants attention and will spontaneously give you affection! \n\nMinnie enjoys walks but is also content to just chill. She gets along with other dogs. She is very curious about cats. This breed is not ideal with pet rabbits or Guinea pigs. Because of her small size, we would not recommend her be adopted into a home with young children. She will bark if something alarms her, but we do not consider her a \u2018barker\u2019. She does well with car rides and she will make a wonderful companion!\n\nMinnie is house trained once she knows the routine. Sometimes she will make a funny noise and dance when it's her time to go! She is spayed, microchipped and UTD on vaccines.\n\nTo meet Minnie, please go to www.pettalesrescue.com and fill out an application. Her adoption fee is $250.00.",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nMy name is Luna they say I am almost 4 yrs old and everyone who meets me thinks I am the biggest sweetheart. I want to be by my human's side or sleeping at their feet all the time. I am a loyal and obedient companion. I pick up training and commands very quickly and actually thrive on structure. I LOVE playing catch with a ball outside and rolling around in the grass. I am so excited to go out for a walk or a run because I love physical activity and exercise. My ears perk up with giddiness as the breeze blows on my nose. I'll give you tons of kisses to express how much love I have to give. I've had a very tough life but that hasn't changed my playful and charming personality. I'm extremely curious about cats so I would probably do better in a home without them. I'm just waiting for the right family to love and call my own.\n\nLuna has her rabies vaccine and spayed/microchipped.\nShee is on flea & heartworm preventative too. I am about 50 lbs of pure love\n\nLuna's adoption fee is $300 - obedience training is required after adoption.\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups. We understand with what is going on in the world that this may be a bit delayed. Once this quarantine and Isolation period is over just email us the completion certificate.\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt adoption, please fill out application at\n\nwww.heidislegacydogrescue.com/apply-to-foster-or-adopt\n\nThank you for completing the application. We are all volunteers and short on time, we will contact you back only if we have more questions or your application is approved and you will be invited to meet the dog. We apologize for not being able to answer everyone back.\n\nFor more information contact Kelly.V@HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nDOGS are in Foster Homes. There is NO shelter.\n\n**Our companions MUST live in your home as part of your family.**We do not transport.\n\n**See our website for more information. www.HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nAll communication is thru email so please be patient with us. We are all volunteers and work full time jobs and have families of our own.\n\nIt takes anywhere between 3-7 days to process an application - the more complete the application the easier it is for us to process it. Please notify your vet that we will be contacting them and to release information to us.\n\nADOPTION PROCESS:\n\n1. The first step is to complete this application,\nwww.heidislegacydogrescue.com/apply-to-foster-or-adopt\n\n***Everyone must submit an application - we only keep them on file for 1 month\n\n2. Application background check, vet check, etc\n\n3. Invitation thru email to meet the dog(s).\n\n4. Adoption Contract",

This dog is not in our rescue and we will not be able to answer specific questions.\nChris is approximately an 11 years old, male neutered blind poodle. He was found wandering the streets of New York City last year and rescued by COLLAR rescue. He has been fostered for a year in a household with 6 dogs and 4 cats and does very well with everyone. He sleeps approximately 20 hours a day but for the hours he\u2019s awake, he craves attention and wants to play. He loves being held and pet by his humans but doesn\u2019t show much interest in the attention of other animals. He is brilliant in the fact that he finds his way from the backyard into the house through the doggie door regardless of being blind. And will always find his human, even if they are being quiet. He should make someone very happy for the remainder of his days.",

Applications can be filled out at www.adoggie4you.org. Please don't call to inquire on your application. We have three volunteers going thru all applications. The average time to review an application is one week. This dog is approximately 4 to 6 months and weighs 8.2. The adoption fee is $300.\n\nMeet Lee. Lee was owner surrendered with his mommy Churry and sister Lea. His owners did not want to continue feeding puppies and was going to \"get rid of them\". Lucky for the dogs the next door neighbor asked if they could have the family. They called us and we took them to the ranch. The pups were a little shy at first, but they are coming out of their shells. They are very smart. They learned the doggy door in less than 15 minutes.",

            "description": "Miss Ellie is ready to find her forever family! <3\n\n\"Ellie is a huge cuddle bug & enjoys hanging out close to you on the couch. Her journey has made her cautious, but she has become so much more trusting and continues to improve on this daily. She likes to act like she is a lapdog. She is a very sweet dog that is eager to please and very smart.\"\n\nEllie came to us after she found herself in the shelter. Little did we know when we tagged her that we had received a surrender form for her a few months back. We were full at the time and couldn't take her. She, unfortunately, had quite the journey since then but she found her way to us anyways. Now, she never has to worry about being on her own again! \n\nEllie is an almost 2-year-old female Great Pyrenees. She weighs about 63lbs but is on the thin side. Ellie is a bit reserved when she first meets people. She does warm up quickly, though. Ellie has not been to any public outings so we are unsure how she would do. Ellie has not shown to be a big chewer in her foster home. When Ellie gets really excited she does jump up on her people. She is very receptive to commands, though. Ellie does good on car rides but does occasionally try to ride upfront. She does good on a leash but could use some more working with. We are unsure how Ellie would do in an apartment setting. Ellie can be quite vocal when she hears other dogs barking or outside noises.  \n\nEllie has a playful personality and at other times she is pretty lazy. Ellie has not shown any interest in playing fetch. She has not had the chance to play in any water, so we are unsure if she is a water dog or not. As of right now, she seems uninterested in playing with toys. When no one is home, Ellie has free-run of the house. At night, she initially sleeps in her foster bed. Afterward, she goes to the floor or a doggie bed. Ellie is potty trained but isn't being kenneled in her foster home. \n\nEllie is such a fun-loving girl! She has a great smile and is adjusting to being part of the family again! Anyone who adopts her will be super lucky! Before you welcome her home, here are some things to know. \n\n-Ellie is good with other dogs. She is scared of them at first, but once she warms up enjoys playing with them. \n\n-Ellie is not being fostered around any cats so we are unsure how she would do with them. \n\n-Ellie has not been around any kids. \n\n-Ellie does have food aggression towards the other dogs. She has gotten better, but feeding time needs to be supervised or she needs to be fed separately. \n\n-Ellie does resource guard a little. She has gotten better but it may be something her new family needs to watch out for. \n\n-Ellie is being fostered in Oklahoma City, OK. \n\nEllie would like a home where she can be a lazy dog with the occasional playtimes throughout the day. She would do well in a home with other dogs with some patience or as an only dog. She has started to enjoy playing/wrestling with her foster's dogs. She is quickly improving on her trust. She has not been around kids, but I think she would be fine with them. She is not too rowdy and pretty easygoing. If this girl sounds like she belongs with you, you can apply to adopt her at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHer adoption fee is $225. That includes DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella shots. She will be micro-chipped, heart-worm tested, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered, and will be current on heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.\n",

            "description": "Mollie is a sweet girl who loves to play fetch with anything: tennis balls, stuffed toys and even snowballs. She is endlessly curious and loves to explore. She is friendly and eager to meet new people, but quickly makes special attachments to those who give her love and attention. Mollie is potty trained and sleeps in a kennel at night at her foster home (but her foster family suspects she would rather sleep in bed with them). This intelligent pup came to her foster family already knowing how to sit and drop it. She is eager to please and eager to learn. Her foster family does not have small children but they think she would do very well with them, yet a couple of times Mollie became nippy with playing, we think some puppy training classes would fix that. She quickly calms down and generally is a very gentle soul. If you are looking for a loyal sidekick, Mollie is the gal for you!\n\nWe believe this dog is a Lab mix and was born on 9/8/20. This puppy is fostered in a private home in Lincoln. The adoption fee is $400 which covers vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter(when old enough). The adoption fee helps cover the cost of these vetting procedures. Unless the bio is marked adoption pending, s/he is still available for adoption. If youre interested in adopting this puppy, please submit an inquiry or email BraveAnimalRescue@gmail.com to ask about our adoption process (please check your spam or junk email if you do not hear back from us within a few business days). We are 100% volunteer staffed and will respond to your email as soon as possible. After you have submitted an application and been approved, we will set up a meet and greet between you and the puppy. Preference is given to applicants with a verifiable vetting history, fenced yard, and homeownership. Please be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram to learn more about Brave Animal Rescue and our mission.",

He has great manners (other than the humping that goes away with time) and is intelligent. He likes to talk to you when happy/excited, is incredibly sweet with people, and loves pets and hugs. He is average energy- will need moderate exercise but is not a marathon runner. He doesn't get upset about much - though he does have some mild anxiety about being left behind. He does not like to be left alone and will become vocal when separated from his people/dogs. He will do best in a kennel when left alone until he can be left without destruction.\n\n \n\nHe is friendly with other dogs but really needs some improved social skills so he can learn to be less humpy with new friends. Stormy has some basic training down but will benefit from a consistent, settled home and some work on-leash and with new experiences. He is strong, so will need an owner that can handle him and train him to walk on a leash without pulling. He is protective of the family and people coming to the door. Its possible that he was trained or encouraged to do so, but It is the only time he shows any kind of aggression. Stormy will do best in a home with no small children.\n\n \n\nFrom Stormys foster:\n\nStormy should have been named Shadow because he is always right behind you. He wants to be where people are and will be a great go-everywhere dog. When he is settled, he is quite quiet and sweet. He loves bones and toys and would be a great dog to do agility work with - he has mad jumping skills. We actually really enjoy this beautiful boy and hope he will find someone that can take him along everywhere.\n\n \n\nIf youre interested in adding Stormy to your family, our adoption process is outlined in our pinned post and on our website: www.kpalrescue.org/pet-adoption/. Our Adoption Application can also be found on that website. \n\n \n\nKPAL Rescue dogs are fully vetted (vaccinated, microchipped, etc.) and spayed/neutered, there will be an adoption fee of $350 so that we can continue to help other animals in need. Serious inquires only, please, and feel free to share.\n\n \n\n#kpalrescue\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n#animalrescue #rescue #alaskananimalrescue #alaskarescue #alaskaanimalrescue #animallovers #nonprofitorganization #kenaipeninsula #kenai #soldotna #rescuedog #dogsofalaska #alaskadog #dogsofthekenaipeninsula #rescuedogs #adoptme #adopt #takemehome #adoptable #stormy #mixedbreed #pitmix",

He is microchipped, neutered, comes with 2 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, and all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.)

She adores going for walks and lights up with excitement when she sees a leash. Sweetie loves toys, does OK in a crate (but doesn\u2019t love it), and behaves well in the car.\n\nAlthough Sweetie doesn't mind cats, she doesn't like other dogs. She needs to be the only dog in the home, and any children should be over age 12. Dogs and kids intimidate Sweetie, and she only calms down when she is away from them. \n\nSweetie can bark a lot when she's startled by noises. For this reason, she would not be good for apartment or condo living. Sweetie is quiet when in a calm home. Overall, this dog is a sweetie...her name fits! She\u2019d make someone an amazing Valentine. Sweetie is ready to go home.\n\nSweetie's minimum adoption fee is $265 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n",

He might not be a big cuddler but he does like his head and back scratched.\n\nBoe loves meal time and treats and being outdoors. He\u2019s usually very quiet but he likes to express his excitement over food and his foster family\u2019s return after an outing.\n Boe loves his crate. He likes to retire to his crate at the end of the day and when he needs some time for himself. Boe chooses to exclusively sleep in his crate but he does not require crating while left alone. Boe is house trained and he will alert when he needs to go outside by pawing at the door. \nSince Boe is on the mellow side he would do best with a less active family and one without small children. Although Boe is a senior boy at 14 years old he isn\u2019t slowing down yet. He knows there are lots of treats and head and back scratches in his future.\n\nBoe had some big changes this year so it may tak ed him a while to warm up to his new home and people. Please he patient w our lil guy and he will turn out to be your best bud!\n\n * mellow dogs welcome \n* low key home environment \n* +13 yrs old kids in home \n* cats unknown \n\nAre you interested in giving Mr.Boe a home? Apply and the adoption specialist will contact approved apps for meets!\n\nApply at w2wrescue.com \nAdoption fee $150",

He is a sweet quiet boy that is used to having a dog pal around so he MUST be adopted in a home with another dog. He will also need a home where someone is home more often than not. He prefers a laid-back environment but older children (10 +) would be fine for him. He is doing well with housetraining if let out frequently. Thunderstorms are scary for the little guy so we hope his new family will comfort him. He walks well on a leash and doesn't mind car rides so he would make a great buddy to go on your errands with since he is so friendly and loves everyone he meets. His foster mom doesn't have cats but she thinks that he would get along with them if they were in his new home. He prefers to sleep in bed with his person but if he is in a dog bed, he likes to be tucked in with a blanket. He is a friendly, social boy that just needs a person to love him as much as he will love his new family. \n\nIf you think that you have the perfect family for Baxter, please visit our website www.PoodleandPoochRescue.org where you will find an application to adopt in order to be connected to his foster mom. He is up to date on his vaccines, neutered, heartworm negative, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $300.",

He gets along great with other dogs, cats, and should be fine with kids. \n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle.

            "description": "Daisy is a sweet playful little senior. She is approximately 11 years old and was surrendered by family members after her owner passed away. She is great with other dogs big and small. She is currently infatuated with a large Siberian Husky here at ARF. She loves attention and walks great on a leash. She is good with kids and cats as well. Would be a fantastic family member for any home. She is being treated for very dry skin and hair loss from stress. \n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

            "description": "*PLEASE DO NOT APPLY FOR WILLOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FENCED IN YARD. She is considered a fight risk and is petrified of leashes. we want to be extra careful with her for that reason .\n \n\n \n\nHi, my name is Willow. I came in from Kentucky after being found living outside on a property with a few other dogs. After a while, the rescue realized I had milk and took me back where I came from. I led the rescue right to my four puppies and they saved us all. \n\nRight now, Im in Pittsburgh with my foster family. At first, I was very scared of them and would hunker every time they touched me even though I wagged my tail to let them know I was sweet. \n\nAfter 8 weeks of being in my foster home, all my puppies went home and they have been helping work to bring me out of my shell. I am now crate trained, potty trained, dog friendly, and good with all humans and older kids ! I do still take a while to adjust to new surrounds and tend to be scared but once someone gives me the time I need to adjust, I come right around and am a happy go lucky pup !\n\n \n\nI have two foster dog brothers ,a foster dog sister, and 2 older cats that I like to look at but don't touch! Me and my foster dog siblings can play FOREVER in the back yard. I am QUICK and zippy when I play with other dogs and smile the whole time!! My foster parent would love to see another young dog in my adopters home!\n\nThe rescue thinks Im between 1-3 years old . Im a very very sweet girl and am very content just laying around getting belly rubs all day with humans since Ive missed out on it so much ! I don't play with humans like I do my foster dog friends, I prefer being more gentle with humans \n\nMy new owner must have a TALL fence to keep me safe because my foster parents say I'm a flight risk AND because I am REALLY scared of leashes . As soon as a leash is put on me.. I just lay down and am sad. . I dont think Id do very well with kids younger that are energetic because kids pulling my ears and poking me would REALLY scare me too much. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please submit an application from crossyourpaws.com and submit an application!",

He does well with other dogs when properly introduced but would likely chase cats.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nHi my name is Minnie and I'm the cutest little puppy you'll ever meet! I am such a sweet girl, I love snuggles and kisses and just hanging out in your lap. I have the smoothest, silkiest fur around. I also love to play! I love tugging my crinkle toy with my sister and chewing on my little rubber bones. I can get a little mouthy when excited but just pop a chew toy in my mouth and I'm good to go. The first couple of nights I needed to sleep in my crate with my sister next to my foster mom's bed so I wouldn't cry. Now I can sleep through the night with my sister in our puppy pen with our crate connected without so much as a peep! I also go freely into my crate during the day to snooze when my foster mom needs to get some work done. I've been working on potty training with puppy pads and I've gotten so good that I almost always go on the pad! I like my pen nice and clean and will even use my cute little nose to fold a used puppy pad up to cover my mess. I love going outside and playing in the snow in my little jacket but with it being so cold out, I'm not able to stay out long. I haven't had a chance to use my leash yet with the cold weather. I have a bigger foster dog sister whom I love to play with. I get so excited when I get to play with her, I have no hesitation, I just jump right on in on the fun! We run around and wrestle, I'm great at listening to her doggy cues and settling down when I get too excited. I also love playing and cuddling with the kids at my foster home! They have two cats as well, they give me looks like \"don't even think about it\" so I just observe them from a far. Unlike some puppies, I'm able to have my food out and I just eat it as I get hungry during the day, I don't even fight over it with my sister! I enjoy getting little puppy chews. I get so excited! My sister and I run back and forth and just keep exchanging our chews, we think it's great fun!\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, rabies vaccination, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Distemper combo vaccines appropriate to age, Bordetella vaccine, heartworm and flea/tick preventative while in rescue.

While was in the shelter it is apparent to his foster family that he was in a home prior to the shelter. Wyatt has only marked in the house one time and has had no potty accidents. He is a gentleman on the leash. He is enjoying some long walks even in this chilly weather. While he is friendly with other dogs, wagging his tail, he has not engaged in playing with his foster sister yet. Wyatt loves to snuggle and have his belly rubbed. He is working with his foster family on some mild food insecurity. Wyatt is a wonderful boy who will make the perfect addition to your family. Contact Northern Lakes Rescue to adopt this cutie! Wyatt's adoption fee is $375 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Ivy and I am a friendly young pup. I came from warm Texas and am not exactly liking the cold MN weather. My foster mom bought me a jacket to wear outside when I have to go potty so its not super miserable. Im learning not to potty in the house but still have accidents. I like playing and getting attention from my foster family. Im the happiest when Im around them. I walk nicely on a leash, and eat my food when I get hungry. I only bark when I really need to. I really like sleeping in my kennel it makes me feel safe and protected. I try to listen to my foster mom and do exactly as she says Im learning something new everyday! Ivy's adoption fee is $375 which covers her spay, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care she may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

He likes strong toys to channel his playing and chewing, and he prefers being the solo dog in a home. He can be reactive at first when approached by new people who enter his home, so he's been working on his training so that he won't bark or nip (which is coming along well), and he usually warms up to them once he has a slow intro and has the chance to settle.

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "Her finder was running on the trail one day when he noticed a bright white blob from afar.As he got closer he noticed it was a gorgeous white dog with her 7 puppies! At first, he was not sure if mom was going to be protective over her babies but she surprised him by introducing herself with lots of kisses and gave him a warm welcome. The man knew he couldn't leave them all there, but also knew he couldn't carry 7 puppies by himself so he called for backup. When the man's friend showed up he had a moving box and helped load this family up. Mom was SO relieved to have finally met friendly humans that were willing to save her and her babies from the streets.\nThey spent the next few days in their finder's home where she was able to nap without worrying, get spoiled with toys and love and overall she and her babies were finally safe.One day, her finder and his friend loaded them all up into the car again and went for a ride. She was worried they were bringing them back to the trail where they came from but their destination was actually worse - They were at the shelter. She understood that maybe all of her puppies were too much for her finder but never expected to end up in the shelter. Thanks to our donors, though, 4P4L has arranged for these sweethearts to be transported to Colorado the second week of February.\n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time. When we do, it will be updated here. This is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

She has been in our foster care since January 9, 2021 and is doing great! Dolly has a sweet demeanor and is proving to be pretty smart too! She loves the other doggies and kities in her foster home and often naps and plays with them. House training is a work in progress but she does know to follow the adult doggies out to go potty in the morning. Heelers are active and Dolly will need a family who likes to include her in their activities and stimuate her mentally as well as physically. Sweetest Girl!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $600 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer. Adopters will be required to activate the 30 day free pet insurance policy if they want to adopt a puppy.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

He gets a little worried when strangers come a knockin and may not greet everyone with a wagging tail. He currently lives with a small, fluffy female dog and kids and does good with them. This devoted boy is happy to do whatever it is you are doing so if you're going for a ride in the car, he is up for that, if you're hanging on the sofa and watching a movie, he is all about snuggles; if it's exercise he is always up for a walk or a hike. He is house trained, knows basic commands like sit, shake, lay, stay and is ready for his forever family! He is reative on leash when dogs are in close proximity. Bentley is a courtesy post.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting him please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $250 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

My whole story isn't very clear, but when I was found tied to a tree on the side of the highway, I didn't have a lot of trust in humans. Can you blame me?  Fast forward a few weeks and in such little time, I am making huge strides! I'm way more trusting and it didn't take long to see my goofy, playful, puppy-side come out, especially around other dogs. I love to play with other dogs as long as they tolerate me being a goofball!  I'm smart, LOVE to play, and am eager to please.  I would do well with an experienced owner since it can take me an extra minute to warm up to new situations, but shelter staff are confident that with the right socialization, a lot of those worries will melt away--so many already have in such little time.  I'm motivated to learn and always seek out the affection of my person.  Bonus: I give the BEST HUGS!  Give me a little reassurance and you'll have a companion for life <3 \n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please call 541 474 5458 for an appointment. All appointments are made by phone for the most up to date availability of the pets and the schedule. Thank you.",

Hes fairly mellow for a puppy does have some short bursts of playful energy but mostly likes to lounge with a chew toy. He is submissive and a little shy at first and is learning to build his confidence in new situations. He will sometimes freeze and/or flatten to the floor when he is overwhelmed or unsure but can be coaxed with some praise and reassurance. He is learning to walk on a leash. Marley doesnt pull but is learning not to walk directly underfoot, not to chew on the leash, and how to take leash corrections. He is very eager to please and food motivated. He has had minimal accidents in the house and will likely be housetrained quickly once he gets on a consistent schedule. He cries for 5-10 minutes in the crate when he is initially put in but settles quickly and sleeps through the night.\n\nMarleys ideal home would be with people who have raised puppies before and can set a schedule for him to continue to progress in crate training and house training, as well as continue his leash training and teach him basic commands. Marley looks to his humans for guidance and reassurance so someone who is calm, confident and patient will be his best partner as he continues to gain confidence and settle into a new environment!\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page. Thank you for your interest in saving a life!",

            "description": "Reni turned 2 years old in December. She is 60 lbs with long legs. She is a goofy loveable doodle. She loves other dogs, and loves to swim and play ball. She is housetrained. She is friendly and loves everyone. She still has a lot of puppy in her. She needs some obedience training, she will jump on you and put her big paws around your neck for a hug. She needs to learn some manners and she will do anything for a treat. She can also be a counter surfer. She has a bit of separation anxiety, she wants to go everywhere with you. She needs a home where someone is home during the day. She doesn't like to be crated, but can be for a couple of hours if needed. She will not chew on anything but your shoes if left laying around. She is a bed hog. When told to get off the bed she will, until you fall asleep she will sneak back up. No small children as she will knock them over when she gets excited. MUST HAVE A FENCED IN YARD. A young active retired couple would be a good option for Reni or someone that works out of their home on a permanent basis. She is up to date on vaccines, spayed and microchipped. Adoption fee is $250 Reni will go for adoption with a 10 day trial. So applicants out of state will not be considered. Must be within 1 hr of Grovertown, In.

She was so happy when they wanted to take her for a walk. DeeDee has an adorably inquisitive nature and likes to take time to stop and smell the roses! ...and the grass, and the dirt, and the trees, and just about everything else!\n\nDeeDee has done well with her house training and has done well with training pads and also learning to go outside. Additionally, DeeDee is crate trained and does well sleeping in there at night. DeeDee's foster family has taught her wonderful manners, and she happily follows the rules of their home. They tell us that it has been a total joy to have her in their home!",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting Zachary, please email his foster Mom Justine at jbulloc4@gmail.com\n\nIn the market for Candy Hearts this Valentine's Day season? Skip the sugar this year this year and look no further than sweet, sweet Zachary! \n\nZachary has been filling his foster parents' home with his goofy, sweet nature. They have even nicknamed him Sweetie Z with all the love he has to give and will happily receive. His foster parents tell us that Zachary can be your total shadow and loves to lay by your side while you WFH all day. He *patiently* stares out the window until you're ready to get up for dinner...or play! Zachary will toss his toys around, nudge you for attention, and give lots of kisses. \n\n'Sweetie Z' has benefitted from his foster sister who helps to show him the ropes. While in foster, Zachary has done well seeing and greeting other dogs and shows an inquisitive nature towards making new doggo friends. While Zachary has not been seen around cats, he can be shy around other dogs that are barking or excited. \n\nZachary's leash manners are well underway! His foster tells us that Zachary can be a fast walker and may even benefit from a jog every now and then. Outside of this, he does well for the most part and has high tail wags with lots of sniffs. He can pull a bit at times and does turn shy at loud noises or lots of commotion. For this reason, Zachary is best suited for a quieter environment (no hustle and bustle of a big city) and especially a house with a yard for zooms! \n\nSpeaking of zoomies! Zachary loves to go out, in, out, in, and then back out again! Being in the backyard gives Zachary a serious case of the zooms...there is just so much fun to be had out there. His fosters write, \"he does the cutest downward dog combined with a happy dance when he is excited. His whole body squirms!\" Zachary's manners come into play when you can tell he wants to jump up for kisses but resists the urge and will stay down. \n\nZachary would do best in a home with no young children. 'Sweetie Z' enjoys his sleep and can be a tad grumbly when he's not quite done catching Z's (or chasing tennis balls in his dreams). After he gets his beauty sleep in, he's back to his regular self with a great house-training skillset and sweet nature to boot. Additionally, Zachary would prefer to find a home where his people are around all the time...Zachary does not love to be left by himself since there is no one around to love on! \n\nZachary's ideal family will greet him with patience while he settles in so he can open up on his own time. After he's confident that you've got the best couch for snuggles, you will have a lifetime of love to cash in. \n\nNo need to keep swiping for a Valentine this year...Zachary is ready to go home with you today!",

She can be hard of hearing, except when food is concerned. She is a perfect lap dog & companion. She has a quiet, calm demeanor and great disposition. Her adoption fee is $195 and covers the cost of her spay, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), a blood test to confirm Molly is in good health and teeth cleaning.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for he/she. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We do not hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog, please visit our website to complete an adoption application. It is in the ADOPTION folder at the top of our home page. Just fill in the blanks and SEND.\nWe commonly receive multiple applications for a single dog. Nevertheless, only one applicant will be invited to meet a dog on Saturday at Petsmart in Yorba Linda between noon and 3 pm OR on a mutually agreeable day, time and place during the week.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $295-$495.",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Dude is a very sweet 3 year old, 70lb Shepherd mix who joined us from Texas on January 23rd. His Texas foster reports that he is a very sweet guy and plays well with small dogs. We will post more info as we get to know him.\n\nFoster Update: Dude is settling in well and is a very sweet natured dog. He gets along great with the resident dog. He is great on leash and walks right next to you when there are no distractions. He knows some commands like sit, come and paw but still working on his name (he's very open to a name change). He doesn't seem overly energetic, but does enjoy playing with squeaky toys. He has not been a fan of the crate but we are working on it.\n\nDude is still getting over kennel cough so we will not be scheduling meet and greets for a few more days.\n\nDude is a pretty easy going dog and we think he could make a great companion for almost any situation. He may also be a good fit for a first time dog owner, given there's interest in continuing to work with him on general obedience.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in Texas and joined us from Scarf rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

They look like Australian shepherds but may have some german shepherd in them as well. They are both very outgoing girls and will be going out on a foster to adopt basis as they are larger breed dogs and we want to wait to do their surgeries until they are 6 or 8 months. so they will go with 2 vaccines on board, a microchip, and a spay voucher for $50 for completion of the surgery in the future. We do have to collect a $125 check from the adopter in order to comply with the Montana code. That will be returned after the surgery is completed and thus it is a spay guarantee.

We received her from a friend who does rescue and needed to find her a great new home that would be permanent and thought we could do a good job of finding that for her. We sure hope we can! She is a 35 pound 1.5 year old girl who does great on a leash and does love people. She seems to be OK with other dogs here at the shelter but we were told that she is best as an only dog. She loves to be comfortable around her people and will snore when she sleeps. She would be a great companion for someone and she will likely do well on leash walks around other dogs. But we would like to find her a home where she can lounge in the love without competing with other dogs for it. We think a nice retired home or quiet loving older family could be a great fit. she is totally adorable and has the most beautiful markings. She is spayed and chipped and fully vaccinated and ready to go...Adoption fee is $250",

He is now with us and we will be working on his confidence level and his tolerance level too. He is totally adorable and likely is a dachshund and spaniel mix. He is about 1.5 years and about 10-12 pounds or so. He will need a retired couple or a family with older children who will treat him with respect. We will be trying to place him in a quiet home with a person who is patient, because it will likely take him awhile to get over what he has had to deal with and the unkindness that he has suffered through. He will be neutered soon and will have a microchip placed. He is fully vaccinated and adoptable for $200",

She loves to run and play with her brother and seems to like all other dogs. With this in mind, we think Annie would be happiest in a home with another dog who will be respectful of her current small size. We don't really know what her breed mix is but I'm sure she will keep growing. She has really been on a growth spurt lately. A fully fenced yard is also important for her. We have been working on potty training s she is not fully trained yet. We feel she will learn quickly once in a home.\n\nWe don't know how Annie is with cats but at her young age, we think she would be fine.\n\nIf this sweet little girl looks like the perfect addition to your home, you can meet her on Saturdays from 10-2 at 809 Rockford Rd SW. She will be happy to show you what a good girl she is as she sits for a treat. We urge you to fill out an application prior to your visit.",

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Moose, a 9-week old, 10-pound, Shepherd, Aussie Shepherd/Lab mix little guy.\n\nMoose is a cute healthy baby, who is gentle and playful. And he\u2019s the perfect age to teach, train and socialize. \n\nHe\u2019s already showing how smart he is and that he really thrives on human companionship. He is outgoing and friendly, but happiest when he can interact with the people he knows best.\n\nHe\u2019s a high energy baby and will continue to need lots of exercise throughout his life.  If you to play games, you\u2019ve found the perfect pal to teach and train.  \nHe\u2019s sure to amaze you with how agile and talented he\u2019ll become. \n\nMoose is ready and waiting to become a true animal companion, your absolute best friend.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  Due to the young age of this puppy, he/she is not housebroken or trained unless otherwise specially indicated. All puppies require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Moose, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $550]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nMeet Handsome Oliver!\n\nOliver is a 4 year old Shepherd mix who came into the San Antonio animal shelter as a stray with a wound on his neck from an embedded collar that had to be removed & high heartworm positive. Due to both of these he quickly landed himself on the euthanasia list. We were able to pull Oliver to safety & get him seen by a vet. His neck is all healed up, he has completed heartworm treatment & he is finally ready for his forever home! \n\nOliver is nervous around other dogs and will require slow introductions to any resident dogs in the home. We have had him evaluated by a trainer and he did great with other dogs! He wasn't interested in playing with them, but he was not aggressive, he was more interested in hanging out with his foster instead. He does get very excited when he sees other dogs on the leash and will pull to try and meet them! His current foster is working with him on the leash pulling, but he will require continued work in this department.\n\nWe don't have any information on Oliver with cats, but his foster said he did try to chase one in their backyard, so we are recommending a home with no cat friends. \n \nOliver LOVES kids! When on his daily walks he gets so excited when he sees kids and pulls to get to them! He does get very excited when he meets them and tries to jump up and give them hugs. His foster is also working with him on this, but due to this and his energy level we are looking for a home with kids over the age of 10 years. \n \nOliver is fully house broken! He only had one accident in his foster's house when he first arrived, but never since. Sometimes when dogs are transitioning to a new home, accidents will occur so patience will be key for Oliver when he first comes home with you. \n\nOliver is currently the only dog in his foster home and can be a bit possessive when it comes to food so if other dogs are in the home, it will be best to feed them separately. \n\nOliver LOVES his tennis balls, kong toys, & playing tug-o-war with his foster parents! He is also able to entertain himself and will play with the tennis ball for hours on end.  Oliver would love a home with an active family as this boy has some energy! \n\nOliver does well in the kennel and will go in easily with treats. His foster family has not left him home alone outside of the kennel, so we're not sure how he would do free roaming while someone is not home. \n \nLastly, Oliver's foster had this to say about him, \"Overall, Oliver is a great boy with a happy personality! We have a comforter that he can sleep on, but he likes to \"hide\" tennis balls in it and then \"find\" them.  He then hikes the ball between his legs, he entertains himself with this activity at night. In addition, he tends to slobber, his tennis balls are sopping wet when he plays with them.\n \nAn ideal home would be one with owners who love to play with dogs.  Oliver will chase balls or play tug of war for hours.  He will drop tennis ball in your lap so you can toss it for him.  He is very capable of playing by himself, but much happier when he is playing with someone.  He has an adorable tongue that hangs out the side of his mouth when he is waiting for you to play.\"\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

            "description": "***Please DO NOT send us inquiries/emails asking if this dog is still available. If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nMeet Handsome Oliver!\n\nOliver is a 4 year old Shepherd mix who came into the San Antonio animal shelter as a stray with a wound on his neck from an embedded collar that had to be removed & high heartworm positive. Due to both of these he quickly landed himself on the euthanasia list. We were able to pull Oliver to safety & get him seen by a vet. His neck is all healed up, he has completed heartworm treatment & he is finally ready for his forever home! \n\nOliver is nervous around other dogs and will require slow introductions to any resident dogs in the home. We have had him evaluated by a trainer and he did great with other dogs! He wasn't interested in playing with them, but he was not aggressive, he was more interested in hanging out with his foster instead. He does get very excited when he sees other dogs on the leash and will pull to try and meet them! His current foster is working with him on the leash pulling, but he will require continued work in this department.\n\nWe don't have any information on Oliver with cats, but his foster said he did try to chase one in their backyard, so we are recommending a home with no cat friends. \n \nOliver LOVES kids! When on his daily walks he gets so excited when he sees kids and pulls to get to them! He does get very excited when he meets them and tries to jump up and give them hugs. His foster is also working with him on this, but due to this and his energy level we are looking for a home with kids over the age of 10 years. \n \nOliver is fully house broken! He only had one accident in his foster's house when he first arrived, but never since. Sometimes when dogs are transitioning to a new home, accidents will occur so patience will be key for Oliver when he first comes home with you. \n\nOliver is currently the only dog in his foster home and can be a bit possessive when it comes to food so if other dogs are in the home, it will be best to feed them separately. \n\nOliver LOVES his tennis balls, kong toys, & playing tug-o-war with his foster parents! He is also able to entertain himself and will play with the tennis ball for hours on end.  Oliver would love a home with an active family as this boy has some energy! \n\nOliver does well in the kennel and will go in easily with treats. His foster family has not left him home alone outside of the kennel, so we're not sure how he would do free roaming while someone is not home. \n \nLastly, Oliver's foster had this to say about him, \"Overall, Oliver is a great boy with a happy personality! We have a comforter that he can sleep on, but he likes to \"hide\" tennis balls in it and then \"find\" them.  He then hikes the ball between his legs, he entertains himself with this activity at night. In addition, he tends to slobber, his tennis balls are sopping wet when he plays with them.\n \nAn ideal home would be one with owners who love to play with dogs.  Oliver will chase balls or play tug of war for hours.  He will drop tennis ball in your lap so you can toss it for him.  He is very capable of playing by himself, but much happier when he is playing with someone.  He has an adorable tongue that hangs out the side of his mouth when he is waiting for you to play.\"\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

I will need an experienced owner willing to give me the time to adjust.\n\nI just arrived to ODHS but the humans promised to update my bio as they learn more about me! \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Cody is housebroken and can be crated, likes car rides and LOVES walks.  Like most Huskies he is very energetic and will have to have a  fenced yard and a family that can give him lots of attention and playtime. He also loves to just sit and chill out after a nice long walk.  He will sit on command and has quite nice manners.  He does pull some on a leash so a walking harness is recommended.  Cody will be a fabulous dog for an active, energetic pet owner. His adoption fee is $250. Located in Springfield, Mo, \n\nTo find out more please fill out an application at www.wonderweimsrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/. To speak with the foster or visit the adoptable pet you must have an approved application on file.   Once you fill out an application a volunteer will contact you to get you approved.

            "description": "Woof, woof! I'm so excited you're thinking about adopting a new fur-ever family member! Here are a few things that may help you with your big decision. First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy.

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

I have a lot of energy and will need help learning how to get that energy out in appropriate ways. I could use some work on my mannors as well. I am also high energy around other dogs and have a history of being too much for other dogs in the home. My dream home would be one where I am the only dog, I am provided with training opportunities, many toys to play with, and daily excersize. If you are looking for a good running or hiking companion, here I am waiting for you!",

He's come out of the ordeal with one less limb, but he believes in keeping a positive attitude! Three- legged dogs get around just fine!! Staff and volunteers have described Adniel as friendly, affectionate and sweet. He's easy to leash and walks politely, though his walks should be kept short for awhile while he adjusts. No marathons for this guy, unless they're on Netflix! Ask about how you can help this special senior today!",

            "description": "Hi, everyone. I'm very shy so as my foster mom writes this, I have my head hidden under her bed. My name is Rebel which I must have been named ironically. I am a timid, but very sweet and smart 4year old lab/hound mix, weighing in around 45-50 lbs. I am slow to warm up to new people but I love snuggling with my people once I'm very familiar with them. When my family has friends over, I can be found hiding in a back bedroom until the friends leave. When I meet new dogs, however, I am very excited and friendly, showing my more playful side. I have even done fine around cats and chickens so far. I also LOVE being outside, running and hopping around the yard.\nMy foster family says I am very good about doing my business outside, going into my kennel, and behaving nicely when I'm left to roam the house when they are gone. It has taken me quite a while to feel comfortable around my foster family, but with patience and kindness, I now eat, drink, go potty, and occasionally venture out of my resting spots to be near my people. It will very likely take some time to grow comfortable with my forever family, but I promise it will be worth it. You will find me a very loving, sweet, and mostly mellow pup with a playful, gentle soul.\nBonus: I am up to date with shots, spayed, and microchips which makes me a steal for my adoption fee of $300. I will make a wonderful addition to any person's/family's life if they have the patience to give me the time to open up and feel comfortable in your home so I can show you what a fantastic companion I can be. I am being fostered in Viroqua, WI. If you'd like to consider adopting me, please apply at http://www.lastpawrescue.org/\n501(c) approved WI agricultural license 285589 DS",

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nCampbell Lakes \"Campbell\", male\nHe is one of the sweetest of the bunch.  he loves cuddles and has the most endearing look in his eyes.  His ears perk up when he is spoken to and his tail goes wild. Campbell's adoption fee is $400\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "PHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Remi, a 9-month old, 40-pound Mountain Cur/Box mix young fellow in need of a friend.\n\nRemi is a sweet young boy.  He loves people and just wants to be loved. \n\nHe is shy and needs more socialization, but this will be easy in a home where he is treated like family. He's at a good age to train and incorporate into your home.  \n\nHow can you resist those bright sweet eyes! \n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Remi, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

He loves playing and being around other dogs of any breed. His last companion was a very small chihuahua. He would do better with a dog of similar age. He does well with cats, mostly just stays away from them. He loves attention from all humans and really is needing someone to spend more time with him. He is an inside dog and doesn't like being out in the yard alone but enjoys being outside with his people. He won't swim but will go in the water up to his chest. He loves to play and go for walks.

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nSharon Woods \"Sharon\", female\nShe is one of the smaller puppies who has figured out a way to squeeze through the puppy pen bars, she greets her foster moms with a wagging tail and puppy whimpers, she loves attention and to be held, she will yell if she is not able to get to her siblings/people. Sharon's adoption fee is $400\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Please submit an application and we will link you up for an intro!\n\nGuinness is eligible for a foster-to-adopt.\n\nAge: ~ 1 year\nWeight: ~75lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Yes, doing well with his crate training \nDog sociability: is a frustrated greeter on leash (will bark/pull/jump when he sees other dogs), has done well off leash in playgroup with other dogs\nCat sociability: not a match\nKid compatibility: not a match (stranger danger)\nIdeal living situation: Adult-only home in a quiet neighborhood. No high-rises or large apartment buildings\n\nGuinness is the smartest dog ever! He loves to interact with you and will try to spend as much time as possible with you. He is super inquisitive and will follow you all over the house just to see what you're up too. Guinness loves his routines and insists on a bite of cheese first thing in the morning before you get your coffee and wants to say good night every night at bed time. Guinness does have some challenges with taking walks and meeting new people and is looking for an adopter that can continue his training plan. Once he gets to know you, he loves you fiercely! As a German Shepard Dog training is the name of the game. If you like teaching dogs new skills and keeping existing ones sharp he is your guy! Guinness needs space to stretch his long legs and get in some good vigorous play with a ball or stick so having a back yard is a plus for him. He will thrive in a quiet neighborhood as well. This good boy is so ready to find his home!\n\nDue to a generous donation his adoption fee is now sponsored and he is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested and microchipped.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Muneco is approximately 9 months old. \nHe weighs 55 pounds and has tons of puppy energy! He does like to jump up, so we are looking for a home that will be patient with him and teach him some manners. He will need an active home that is able to take him on daily walks to give him the stimulation he needs. He is good with other dogs, and would be good in a home with children too. \nHe is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped! His adoption fee is $61 thanks to our sponsor this month, Wags and Menace Make a Difference Program Foundation!!!!\nPlease give us a call if you would like to meet him! 970-625-8808",

Puppy adoption fee is $90 All our dogs and puppies are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccines.\u00a0 Please call 970-625-8808 for more information about this pet.\u00a0 Please leave a message if no one answers.\u00a0 We are often busy and can't get to the phone.  We are open Every Day  8-5. We are closed on major holidays. \u00a0 Check us out on Facebook at Rifle Animal Shelter.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nJust look at those eyes, how cute! \nAnnie is available for adoption and is a 2 year old cattledog mix. Annie is a very sweet girl that LOVES humans. She had a rough start in life and did not have much socialization to start out with, however she has really turned around here at the shelter. \nWith that being said Annie is very active and will need an active home that can wear her out daily. She enjoys the company of other dogs, and would do well in a home with kiddos. She will need a family that will be patient with her adjusting to life inside a home. \nShe is spayed, up to date on vaccines and microchipped also! She weighs 42 pounds. Her adoption fee is $61 this month thanks to our sponsor, Wags and Menace Make a Difference Program Foundation!!\nPlease give us a call if you would like to meet Annie! 970-625-8808",

He is a dog who would love to have an active family (walks, runs, hikes) and the will settle down with some belly rubs as you stream sports or movies.  If you would like to learn more about Flap Jack, please complete an application and then reach out to Mandy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Initially Sadie and Tessa were scared and shut down, but Sadie was the first to come out of her shell and show her fun personality. Sadie is sweet and cuddly but also barky and demanding and can be nippy, so an adult home would be best. Because of her barking, she may not be best for an apartment or condo setting.  She came to QAS with limited training and structure, and so any new home will need to continue training, e.g., continued potty training (she understands it and will need continued training; we can give you pointers on that).  Tessa just went to her new home, and now it is Sadie\u2019s turn!  Sadie likes other dogs and all people. She is smart, food motivated and will be a quick study for her lucky new family. She needs a home with lots of attention and cuddles. * Please email questions to adoptions@quincyanimalshelter.org *",

Then Scout may be your man! This guy is a bouncing ball of energy looking for a dog savvy person to help guide him through life. Scout is super eager to please his people and is doing well learning his basic commands through positive reinforcement. We do not know a ton of his history, but Scout is very excitable and would do best in a home without small children or cats. At this time we are unsure how he would do with another dog in the home. Scout is more than happy to curl up and ask for belly rubs...but he prefers a nice long walk first to get all his sillys' out! Scout wants everyone to know he sees the world through rose-coloured glasses, even if its just with his one eye!\n\n***We've made changes to our adoption process. To adopt:\n1. View Scout's profile: spca.bc.ca\n2. Submit an application: https://spca.bc.ca/survey/cat-adoption-application-nanaimo\n3. If it's a match, staff will contact you to set-up an appointment to come in for a visit or virtual meet & greet!\n4. Live happily furever after\n***We often receive many applications for an available animal. We do our best to respond, although are not always able to respond to all applicants.

She enjoys leisurely walks and is tolerant of rain jackets and other clothes. She also likes warm snuggly blankets and will tuck herself in. \n\nEdith came to the shelter as a stray, and we believe she's around 12 years of age. She recently underwent surgery to clean and remove some teeth, to have some mammary tumors removed, and to get spayed. She is recovering well and enjoying soft foods. Although she underwent surgery she still has some lumps remaining and there is chance they may be cancerous. There is more medical information for anyone interested in giving this sweet girl a quiet home. \n\nTo inquire about Edith, send an application - http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf \n- to animalcare@seattle.gov",

Wolfie was used as a breeding dog to produce pretty puppies before she ended up at a rural animal shelter. She's had a rough time but her spirit is strong! She acts like a puppy for a dog her age and she's ready to find a home!\n\nWolfie is an indoor pup that is crate-trained, good in the car, house-broken and very dog friendly. She will whine or howl to go outside (which sometimes may be 2AM but hey! She doesn't want to have an accident ).\n\nShe loves to groom other dogs and sleeps well in her crate. Wolfie doesn't dig and isn't a blanket chewer. Wolfie will scratch or bang on glass patio doors to be let in. She is a Husky and knows what she wants in life!\n\nWolfie has been seen by our veterinarian on staff. She is a 9 year old alaskan husky. She's been spayed, vaccinated, microchiped, dewormed and is up to date on all flea/tick prevention. She is heartworm negative and up to date on heartworm medication. To meet Wolfie, please check out our online adoption survey at http://www.secondchancenorman.com/index.php?survey",

I'm very sweet to my foster mom, but can sometimes be a little cranky with other dogs if they get up in my face. For the most part, I get along fine with everyone though. I do enjoy sitting on the couch with foster mom and getting a good petting. I've just had a dental cleaning, so my breath is a lot better now. I lost several rotten teeth during the cleaning, so I'll need to eat soft food from here on out. I also had a benign fatty tumor removed from my side. It's healing up right now, but I might have a scar that makes me look extra fearsome! (Just kidding!) During the day and at night, I stay in my crate. I don't mind it in there at all as long as I have a nice comfy blanket to burrow under. I'm housebroken, but did mark a bit when I first went to my foster home. After a week or so, I didn't feel the need to do that anymore and have been perfect since. When let outside, I go potty right away and am sitting at the door ready to come back inside as soon as I'm done. There are no kids or cats here, so I can't tell you how I'd do with them. \nAll in all, I'm a wonderful boy and would sure love to find my forever family. Could that be you?",

I've just had a dental cleaning, so my breath is a lot better now. However, I did lose a lot of rotten teeth, too, so I will need to eat soft food from here on out. During the day and at night, I stay in my crate. I don't mind it in there at all as long as I have a nice comfy blanket to burrow under. I'd also be more than happy to sleep in the bed with you if you're willing. I'm housebroken, but did mark a bit when I first went to my foster home. After a week or so, I didn't feel the need to do that anymore and have been perfect ever since. When let outside, I go potty right away and am sitting at the door ready to come back inside as I don't care for the cold weather. I get along fine with all the other dogs in the household, both big and small. There are no kids or cats here, so I can't tell you how I'd do with them. \nAll in all, I'm a wonderful boy and would sure love to find my forever family. Could that be you?\nIf you would like to meet me, fill out an application and the Bella staff will arrange it.",

We are looking for an adult home  or one with teenage kids and without other pets. He is a big boy at almost 80 lbs and very strong so he will need someone who is physically able to handle him. He was surrendered because his previous family could not bring him into their new living situation. He is 5 yrs  old and has recently been neutered here at the shelter. While we consider Shrek to be moderately active he will require daily exercise and could use some leash training. He has been a very good boy at the shelter and he loves it when we spend time playing with him.",

I walked into his kennel and put on a harness without issue. He was a little excited but eager to have fun. Perfectly leashed trained and did not pull ! He sat for treats like a good boy. Loved to play ball!! A ton of snuggles and wasn't shy to the touch ! A love bug with a great energy ready to explore hikes on a leash !! This dog has got the Good Juju!! Wow !!",

Boo boo is a sweet little cutie who can be apprehensive at first, but warms up quickly. Alongside Yogi, she is the gal that gives Yogi a confidence boost and helps him navigate around the world with a bit more comfort. She's able to give you an emotionally secure and mutually satisfying relationship. Boo boo is a bit more confident than Yogi when making friends with other dogs. She may be hesitant to approach other dogs at first, but with time and patience, she'll soon be initiating play. Let Boo boo sit at your feet, walk by your side, and she'll be forever thankful that you gave her and her best friend Yogi a chance.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Boo boo, along with her best friend Yogi, please email a completed application, found on our website, to Adoptions@eastbayspca.org; and mention the pair by name!

Yogi sure is a handsome pup, with his luscious brown and white coat and piercing honey eyes. He's a shy yet charming canine looking for gentle guidance to help him come out of his shell. With his best friend Boo Boo by his side, that gives him a little confidence push that he needs to navigate in the world. He can really benefit from an adopter willing to give patience and put effort into training him to be more confident in himself and the world around him. Yogi is also weary about making friends with other dogs (other than Boo boo), so he can definitely use help in realizing that making more doggy friends is great too! Treat Yogi kind and sweet and watch as he blossoms.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Yogi, along with his best friend Boo Boo, please email a completed application, found on our website, to Adoptions@eastbayspca.org; and mention the pair by name!

            "description": "Puddle is a female Lab Mix. She weighs just over 50 lbs. She is approximately 4 years old. She lived in a home with a family until they decided they didn\u2019t want her anymore.  It\u2019s a southern thing \u2013 when people get over a dog they don\u2019t care what happens to the dog.  I agreed to take her in and never looked back.  She is an amazing girl.  She is happy go lucky and loves life. She does really well on the leash and is very smart.  She knows how to sit\u2026..it takes a few times asking her but she does it.  So with treat training I think she would excel at training.  She is the perfect size for snuggling! A great girl to exercise with or cuddle with.  She loves to play fetch with the ball. She won\u2019t give it back to you most times but loves to retrieve. For more info please let us know.\n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport.

Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors.

            "description": "This is Wendy. She is a beautiful and loving young girl who has had a rough life and has a hard time with trusting. She's not a fan of lots of noise and activity. She loves to go lay on the couch or the bed and just chill. She is very inquisitive and always watches the birds and squirrels with her big beautiful brown eyes! She walks great on a leash and has never had a single accident in the house. She plays well with all 3 of my resident dogs, big and small. Seems to not care about the cats at all. She is very calm but still pretty skittish. Quick movements and sudden sounds frighten her. Wendy's adoption fee is $350 which covers her spay, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care she may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

            "description": "Albert was found by a Good Samaritan who found him on the free next to a busy road. Thankfully, he sat down in the grass and Albert came over to him so he could save him.  He spent 5 days at a shelter waiting to be reclaimed, but no one came.  He is a young boy, about a year old, recently neutered and ready to go to a new home.  He is housebroken, knows basic commands such as sit, shake and down, and is comfortable going up and down stairs.  He loves romping with other dogs, and is okay with cats.  He's interested in them, but does not harm them. If they hiss and swat him, he backs up and barks.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nAlbert will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $400",

I think she'd love to be the dog at a book club (quietly listening to the discussion from a variety of laps). Bonus if the home has a fireplace. She likes to stay warm and looks cute in sweaters if you like a well-dressed dog. She's happy to take your daily stroll or strolls with you, but it doesn't need to be far. Only dog? Dog friends? I don't think she's too picky on this point so long as there's lap to spare.\"\n\n*Zoey takes a medication twice daily for a heart condition. Off the medication she had coughing, wheezing, and fainting spells. However, on the medication, she's been doing well and her symptoms are very well managed! She likes her walks and is active, but she shouldn't overexert herself.",

He likes to go out for walks but definitely likes being inside more. Ben loves loves to sneak away and sleep on the bed. It's his favorite place to be and he is accustomed to sleeping in his foster mom's bed at night. Please be willing to allow him the same level of comfort. \n\nBen has a great appetite and definitely lets you know he is hungry. He would do best in a home with a single human that doesn't have a huge social life as he craves attention and would like to be the center of your attention. Ben is more drawn to and more comfortable around women then men.\n\nBen suffers from chronic dry eye and will require eye drops 2x a day for the rest of his life which is fairly easy to administer. Ben could also use an understanding hand when it comes to housebreaking. While it has approved while in foster, it is certainly not perfect.\n\nWe do not adopt small dogs to homes with children and we do not adopt any dogs to homes with roommates. All meet and greets will be conducted close by his foster home in New York City. And due to Covid and inclement weather, we are only able to place him in Manhattan or Brooklyn at this time. \n\nTo meet Ben please go to our website and fill out an application: www.beastlyrescue.org/application\n",

Cupid currently weighs around 13 pounds.  Due to the pandemic the shelter is currently adopting dogs to Athens Co. residents only.\n\nIf you have other dogs and/or children at home you must bring them in for a meet and greet to see if they are compatible. \n\nSupport the Athens County Dog Shelter by walking your dog or yourself!  It won't cost you a cent!  Download the app \"Walk For a Dog\" from http://wooftrax.com to your phone and select Athens County Dog Shelter and then take a walk!  It's great for you and your pooches plus it benefits the homeless dogs at the shelter.  Use the app each time you grab the leash.  You, your dog and the shelter will all benefit.\n\nPlease visit  http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/U0RLUOCMT7KI \nto see the wishlist of items that the Shelter is in need of.  Thank You!",

Bingo very closely resembles a baby bear. He\u2019s not, we checked (you only make that mistake once). Like all pups, Bingo loves to play with his foster siblings. He loves naps and does great at putting himself to bed... mostly... usually he makes it all the way. He\u2019s not a fan of the kennel, but would you be with the luxury of a dog bed just right there? He\u2019s doing pretty good with potty training, the doggie door is a great aid to that. Bingo is also very food motivated. But who can blame him? Gotta work on that summer bod. He loves humans and loves car rides.\n\nBingo is a 3 month old catahoula/Great Pyrenees mix. He is neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines and microchipped.\n\nHis adoption fee is $200",

They can be a little shy in new situations but once they\u2019re comfortable they will go all out with their puppy dog eyes to get what they want.

No fault of her own!!\n \nBLOSSOMS story will bring you to tears.\nIt all starts when she was picked up by animal control wandering a pregnant stray in our rescue areas of the rural mid south.\nShe was dumped at the pound waiting a scary fate being pit an prego. Only rescue could pull her put to safety.\nFew days go by an 2 girls walk into that shelter looking to get a dog....\nThey pass her by in jail an they see her an tsay \"hey Nola!\" Shelter staff asks how they know her??\nAs Blossom is so excited to see them jumping up happy to see them.. \nthey respond..\"Oh that's our dog....but we don't want her anymore...\" they walked away from Blossom standing there wagging hair tail at her mommy with all her hopes up... an then just shattered. \nThe shelter staff told them to leave and that they will be getting no dogs! \nCould you imagine her heartbreaking???. I'm sure you could feel it around the world. \nTerrible just terrible.? Our team quickly saw her and pulled her out of deaths way an to safety awaiting our transport.\nSoon after Blossom had her babies and she struggled with a very emotional labor and postpartum. This has been a tough road for this lady. \nWe now have her in a loving Foster home an we will never fail her, she will never feel that heartbreak ever again. \nShe is thriving with all the love and attention from her foster family. She is perfect!! She knows commends. Perfectly housebroken. Crate trained an is learning leash manners great. \nShe is just a pocket pitty. Barely 40lbs. Little short stuff. We guess she is about 1/2 yrs old.  She doesn't mind kitties or dog meets. But she deserves to be the only dog in her new home. Let her get all the love no neglect anymore. \nPlease come visit her in our awesome foster home. Come get to know her.\nEmail us for an application\nHemlockedgerescue@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Hi friend. My name is Chico and I'm a handsome Chihuahua searching for my furr-ever home. I'm a sweet boy looking for a patient family who will give me plenty of time to adjust. I'm a little shy around some people, so it may take me a little time to warm up to them. However, I am a super loving boy and I do well with most people with some encouragement. If I sound like a possible match for your family, please come in and see me! I'll be waiting.\nHOW DID I COME INTO HHHS? I was brought in because my owner passed away, and was really shy. After coming to Helping Hands Humane Society I was placed into a foster home, and I'm now ready to find my fur-ever family. \nHEIGHT: 12\" at the shoulder \nHOW MUCH EXERCISE DO I NEED? I enjoy laying around on the couch with my person. I still need some exercise though to keep me happy and healthy. \nDO I HAVE ANY SPECIAL TOYS? I do like to play with toys around the house. \nDO I KNOW ANY TRICKS? I would love to learn new tricks with my new family. \nAM I A GOOD INSIDE DOG? I would love to live inside so I can spend lots of quality time with you. I just need a patient family who will give me plenty of time to adjust. Please take me out to potty often, while I learn your routine. I get very excited when you come home and am always happy to greet you. Since I am past the puppy stage I'm very well behaved in the home. \nDO I LIKE CATS? I haven't been around any kitties yet. Please ask the adoption counselors to do a cat test with me before going home. \nDO I LIKE CHILDREN? I will do better with older children in the household, I won't be too overwhelmed. Like I said before, I'm a little shy around new people so just remember to go slow with me at first. \nDO I LIKE OTHER DOGS? I don't mind hanging out with other dogs. It would always be best to bring in any canine family members at home to meet with me before going home. \nThanks for reading about me. If you are interested in me please ask an adoption counselor to set up a meet and greet. I can't wait!\nTail wags and kiss\nChico Primary Color: White Weight: 5.8lbs Age: 9yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

He was passed around until we were contacted. \nHe is a large dog and the pictures don\u2019t do him justice on size. But no matter his size he is a total sweetheart! He loves to have his butt scratched. He is gentle about taking treats, knows sit, shake and double shake. He walks well on a leash. He does well with other dogs, but hasn\u2019t been cat tested yet. \n\nHis adoption fee is $175. He is neutered, microchipped, fully vetted, wormed and on flea/tick and heartworm prevention. \n\nPlease fill out an app at sianimalrescue.org for the quickest response in meeting him.",

            "description": "Please meet Shelby!  She is a Pekingese/Papillon mix weighing in at 25 lbs of cuteness!  She and her fur siblings were owner surrendered to us in Bartlett, Tennessee. Their mom passed away and there was no one to care for them any longer.  She is a cute, feisty, fun little girl that loves friends, toys, walks, rides in the car and all kinds of attention. She is a typical Peke in that she can be very particular about things, especially having her face and ears messed with. She is more bluff than bite, but she doesn\u2019t like being made to do things unless they are her idea. We absolutely adore her, but we want everyone to be aware that she does growl (many times we think it is more fun to her than seriousness) and we do not think she needs to live with children because of this. She is a complete lap dog and loves to be petted and have the attention. She would make the perfect dog for an older couple with a quiet household and lots of love to give. She would also make a great companion for anyone seeking a little lapdog that doesn\u2019t expect too much out of her. We know this sounds like a difficult place and that she is a hard dog, but she really is the easiest dog in her foster home. She does her own thing and loves to just sit by you and snuggle. She is housebroken, crate trained (but does not require a crate) and walks very well on a leash. She is nervous about getting a leash put on over her head, but we do recommend a slip leash for her at all times, as she can get nervous about new things. She will require regular grooming, which we are trying to get her used to with daily brushings and trips to our groomer.  \n\nIf you are interested in this adorable, loving, young lady, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Shelby \nBreed:  Pekingese/Papillon\nGender:  Female         \nAge:  3 years      \nWeight: 25 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes    \nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative on 1/5/2021, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  Unknown\nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, older children.

Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page.

Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

I'm preparing an email to send to any inquirers, so that I can forward it quickly.  Unfortunately, it may not be as personal as some of our replies.   Maxwell is an 8 month old Dutch Shepherd, a breed I have never come across.  I looked him up, and here is how he is described:  \"Affectionate, obedient, reliable, alert, loyal, trainable\".  We see all of these traits in Maxwell.  He is just a little shy at first, which is appropriate.  He will warm up to you in about 5 minutes.  We love how his right ear goes up when he is alert to something, but his left ear goes down.  He was surrendered by his owner because she lost her lease.  How sad for her!  We know that she will be comforted knowing that Maxwell goes to a good home.",

He is definitely a people-pleaser and loves to give and receive affection. He is potty trained and doing well in his crate, other than some initial whining. He does jump up when excited and give some \"love chomps,\" especially when you come home from being gone all day or even just 5 minutes. He doesn't know many commands yet but seems to be a quick and eager learner.\n\nVirtubo has muscles on top of muscles so he can easily knock you over or pull pretty hard on the leash when walking. He is currently living with a Husky, Pittie and a Chiwinnie. He and the Pittie are best friends and play all day. Virtubo does play a little rough since he is pretty strong but there hasn't been any issues because our dogs enjoy the rough play. It could be an issue if a dog does not like that type of play. He is very interested in our Chiwinnie and wants to play with her, but she wants nothing to do with that ball of muscle. When he does try to play with her, we redirect him, and he moves on. He can't help it though because he is just a happy guy that wants to play with everything.",

He is energetic but also is a dedicated couch potato and loves to be by his person's side!  \n\nCarter will need a loving and experienced dog owner who will invest time in continuing his training as he can be a little mouthy (which is why he would do better with older children, not youngsters).  He is a wonderful boy, but was not trained his first 3 years of life.  He would do best with another active dog - likely female - and a yard to play in.  \n\n",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Jax. I'm a 4-year-old Treeing Walker Coonhound, weighing about 47-pounds. I was found running during hunting season, and my owner never came to claim me. I am looking for a home to help me break out of my shell! I'm a little nervous at first, but as long as you're calm and patient I'll warm up fast. I prefer older kids and adults since sometimes young kids move fast and really scare me! I love going on walks, getting pets, and napping on my foster mom's couch. My foster mom says I'd make a great hiking buddy, since I just want to explore and sniff everything every where we go! I also love playing with stuffed toys, and have done very well with other dogs, although I may be shy at first. I can't wait to find my forever home!\n\nHis adoption fee is $299. \n\nAll Pet Central animals are up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered, micro-chipped (registration included), and current on parasite prevention. Dogs over six-months of age are heart-worm tested. When adopting, we will ensure that you receive copies of veterinary and microchip records. Due to the construction of our state of the art facility, none of our pets are on site, they are all located in foster homes at this time. \n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out the brief Adopter Survey by clicking on his profile.\n\nAfter we review your completed survey we will contact you by phone or email within 72 hours or less. We're primarily a volunteer organization, so we appreciate your patience. Please note- Out of respect for our volunteers and staff, we are closed on Sundays and Mondays and will not be processing any applications on that day. Do get back to us right away when we call or email regarding an application so that we can quickly connect using the process below: - A PCH adoption counselor will contact potential adopters within three business days (PCH cannot guarantee any pets availability, but we make every effort to accommodate adopters with a reply and possible alternative suggestions). Counselor and client will then have a conversation to answer questions and determine the suitability of a match (if necessary, we may opt to put adopters in touch with foster parents via a meeting app). We do require that adopters discuss all questions before pickup via phone or email in order to minimize direct contact with our staff/volunteers at the time of adoption.\n\n- After a match is made, clients will be asked to sign our adoption agreement and pay the **adoption fee through our secure website ***Please see our modified no-risk return policy\n- We will promptly email all veterinary & microchip records.\n- The PCH adoption counselor will then set up a specific appointment time to come to our office for drive-in pet pick up!\n- Adopters should bring a pet carrier and leash to pick up. Adult pets will be wearing a collar. It is important that clients arrive on time, neither early nor late.\n- Drive-in Curbside Cuddles adoption! Upon arrival inside the Crossroads Center complex (360 Wylie Drive), turn left and look for PCH signage in the corner, in front of the large blue \"YouthBuild\" sign on the building. Adopters should pull in the driveway and all the way up underneath the large overhang.\n- Adopters must stay in their vehicle. Under no circumstances should clients exit their vehicle, so please be prepared with items such as blankets, paper towels, cleanup spray, garbage bags, etc. Call 309-846-9534 when ready.\n- A PCH representative in protective gear will carry or walk the pet out and place in the client's vehicle. Social distancing practices should be respected during this process.\n- We will take a \"Happy Adoption Day\" photo with family and new pet through the window of the vehicle. Thank you to all for saving the life of a shelter pet! **At this time, we can only accept online payment methods. We are unable to take cash and we do not accept checks. If you typically pay in cash please purchase a pre-paid credit card so you are able to use it to pay online! ***Adopter may return this animal for an exchange or refund within 14 days (Minus a $40 processing fee). This policy gives new families and their adopted pet time to get to know one another, as a temporary replacement for the usual face to face meeting with our staff and volunteers. Adopters are always encouraged to contact PCH post-adoption with any questions regarding behavior, health, etc. Our mission is to keep pets and their families happy and together if possible. Pet Central has experienced professionals available to help- from the initial adoption transition and throughout the lifetime of each pet! Thank you for considering a rescue pet!\nSincerely,\nPet Central",

I came up from Alabama and really really like this white stuff that you humans call snow. I love to run and roll around in it as it feels so cool. I love playing with stuffed toys the best because I can throw them in the air and play catch with myself! I try to take everything that I think is a stuffed animal like my foster mom's boots and even blankets outside, but she catches me before I succeed. My mom tells me that I came from a bad place in the past and it makes it take a bit for me to warm up to humans. I am very curious about my new place and am not sure I can free roam so I stay close to the blanket I have on the floor. I have excellent potty manners and go outside to do my business. This crate thing she tries to put me in is a scary place and I would rather hang out on the couch to sleep at night. I love to cuddle with my mom and think that I am a lap dog, my mom tells me I am too big for that but I insist on trying because she eventually gives in. These walk things that my mom takes me on are also so much fun, I enjoy sniffing everything and also marking where we walked as well!! I am really hoping that I can find a furever home that will help me continue to become the most loving family dog I can be!",

Please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process at newhoperescue.org. \n\nThis dog is being fostered with New Hope Dog Rescue (Saskatoon).  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an Adoption Application. Meet and greets are by appointment only and done so after an adoption application has been submitted. A successful applications will be contacted by the foster home to discuss further. We are volunteer run so please be patient.\n \n\nHello!  My name is Nola.  I was born December 1, 2020.  I am a very happy and friendly little girl.  I love my cuddles and just playing/napping beside my human, or even just being in the same room on my blanket.   I absolutely LOVE toys \u2013 all kinds.  I love my rope, my stuffies and my balls, especially the treat balls.  And my foster mom says I am very smart \u2013 it only takes me a few minutes to figure out how the treat balls work (all 3 of them!).  I have lots of energy for a couple hours \u2013 and then I just flake right out for the next couple!  I also love the outdoors, especially the snow!  But I head for the door as soon as I get too cold!  I love laying on my blanket and will \u2018fetch\u2019 the toys my foster mom throws for me, for a long time; that\u2019s a fun game.  \nI am just a puppy so I know I have lots to learn.   I am getting very good at \u2018sit\u2019, but am working on the \u2018stay\u2019 part.  We used pee pads but now am starting to go outside; I have a special \u2018spot\u2019 to do my business and am getting very good at knowing what to do when I go there.  I do like to whine/bark a bit when I\u2019m in my pen, sometimes for attention and sometimes when I\u2019m playing, just to hear myself!   But I do not whine or bark when I\u2019m in my kennel, whether that\u2019s at night or during the day when my foster mom goes out.  I go a solid eight hours at night in my kennel  - I could likely go more but my foster mom needs to get up.  \nI have lots of energy, so I would love a family with kids/pets or I would be very happy with an adult who likes getting out and playing. I have played with my foster\u2019s grandson and we had so much fun!  And the visiting dog was very exciting; I shared my toys easily.   I am microchipped and shots up to date for my age.  I am available to be loved on Feb 5th.   I am just sooo ready for someone to love me; I have much love to give!  \n\nNola has been microchipped, dewormed, current on age appropriate vaccines and has received a health check from a vet. adoption fee is $495 (200 is refunded upon proof of spay).\n\nTo view more dogs go to http://www.newhoperescue.org/adopt/available-dogs/\n\nDisclaimer: in most cases we are guessing the breed mix. These are best guesses on our part. For puppies it can be extremely difficult and we are also guessing on what size they will be. \n\nNEW HOPE DOG RESCUE is not a shelter. Our dogs are placed in loving foster homes. WE NEED FOSTER HOMES TO HELP MORE DOGS - CONTACT US TODAY!!!\nDefinitions:\nPending - means that we are working through the adoption process with the 1st applicant. We usually don't add the pending until we are pretty sure the adoption will go through (like at the home visit stage)\nAdopted - you know!! A happy ending for a homeless dog.",

Full of joy and energy, I bound out of bed each morning looking for fun. If you have a few extra pounds caused by our sedentary life style of late, I'm your guy. A run? A game? A jaunt around the block? I can do all of that in one morning. Getting up to go is as important as a good night's sleep and a bowl of dinner. I love to play with toys-plush, rubber or rope, just let me at 'em. I'm here to help you on your New Year's resolutions. Grab your jacket and a leash, and I'll be ready. Oops, forgot to say that I am a lover, too. OK, let's go! Primary Color: Grey Secondary Color: White Weight: 70.8lbs Age: 1yrs 6mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Wrigley. People call me \"Wrigs\" for short. I'm a 1-year-old, 50-pound Golden Retriever mix, and I'm adorable! I'm house-trained, crate-trained, and know some commands, too! I can sit, stay and shake! I learned those tricks when I was at puppy school. I'm in a home with children currently, and doing very well! I like to snuggle my human foster siblings and they are great at playing, too. I love to play in the snow, go on car rides, and play with my dinosaur toy! I'm looking for a home with a family to love me, play with me, give me lots of exercise and where there are no other small animals. I have been around other big dogs and do very well with them as long as they are my size- the small ones confuse me! Are they really even dogs? I will keep your yard free of cats and other small animals and give you all my love forever! Are you looking for a handsome boy like me? His adoption fee is $125. All Pet Central animals are up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered, micro-chipped (registration included), and current on parasite prevention. Dogs over six-months of age are heart-worm tested. When adopting, we will ensure that you receive copies of veterinary and microchip records. Due to the construction of our state of the art facility, none of our pets are on site, they are all located in foster homes at this time. If you are interested in this pet, please fill out the brief Adopter Survey by clicking on his profile. After we review your completed survey we will contact you by phone or email within 72 hours or less. We're primarily a volunteer organization, so we appreciate your patience. Please note- Out of respect for our volunteers and staff, we are closed on Sundays and Mondays and will not be processing any applications on that day. Do get back to us right away when we call or email regarding an application so that we can quickly connect using the process below: - A PCH adoption counselor will contact potential adopters within three business days (PCH cannot guarantee any pets availability, but we make every effort to accommodate adopters with a reply and possible alternative suggestions). Counselor and client will then have a conversation to answer questions and determine the suitability of a match (if necessary, we may opt to put adopters in touch with foster parents via a meeting app). We do require that adopters discuss all questions before pickup via phone or email in order to minimize direct contact with our staff/volunteers at the time of adoption.\n- After a match is made, clients will be asked to sign our adoption agreement and pay the **adoption fee through our secure website ***Please see our modified no-risk return policy\n- We will promptly email all veterinary & microchip records.\n- The PCH adoption counselor will then set up a specific appointment time to come to our office for drive-in pet pick up!\n- Adopters should bring a pet carrier and leash to pick up. Adult pets will be wearing a collar. It is important that clients arrive on time, neither early nor late.\n- Drive-in Curbside Cuddles adoption! Upon arrival inside the Crossroads Center complex (360 Wylie Drive), turn left and look for PCH signage in the corner, in front of the large blue \"YouthBuild\" sign on the building. Adopters should pull in the driveway and all the way up underneath the large overhang.\n- Adopters must stay in their vehicle. Under no circumstances should clients exit their vehicle, so please be prepared with items such as blankets, paper towels, cleanup spray, garbage bags, etc. Call 309-846-9534 when ready.\n- A PCH representative in protective gear will carry or walk the pet out and place in the client's vehicle. Social distancing practices should be respected during this process.\n- We will take a \"Happy Adoption Day\" photo with family and new pet through the window of the vehicle. Thank you to all for saving the life of a shelter pet! **At this time, we can only accept online payment methods. We are unable to take cash and we do not accept checks. If you typically pay in cash please purchase a pre-paid credit card so you are able to use it to pay online! ***Adopter may return this animal for an exchange or refund within 14 days (Minus a $40 processing fee). This policy gives new families and their adopted pet time to get to know one another, as a temporary replacement for the usual face to face meeting with our staff and volunteers. Adopters are always encouraged to contact PCH post-adoption with any questions regarding behavior, health, etc. Our mission is to keep pets and their families happy and together if possible. Pet Central has experienced professionals available to help- from the initial adoption transition and throughout the lifetime of each pet! Thank you for considering a rescue pet!\nSincerely,\nPet Central",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Buford! I'm a Collie mix, about 1-year-old and weighing about 60-pounds. I was a farm dog, but I liked the chickens so much and tried to play with them. They were scared of me after that, so I was relinquished to a shelter. I'm such a good boy! I love to be pet and around my human. Belly rubs are my favorite! I walk well on a leash, and I'm house-trained. I have been around other dogs and I do great. Due to my size, I would live my best life in a home where the children and grandchildren are age 10 and up. I'm also a hard worker, especially at the office, as you can see by my pictures! I can't wait to find a home (with no chickens!) of my very own. Are you looking for a sweet boy like me? \n\nHis adoption fee is $345. \n\nAll Pet Central animals are up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered, micro-chipped (registration included), and current on parasite prevention. Dogs over six-months of age are heart-worm tested. When adopting, we will ensure that you receive copies of veterinary and microchip records. Due to the construction of our state of the art facility, none of our pets are on site, they are all located in foster homes at this time.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out the brief Adopter Survey by clicking on his profile. \n\nAfter we review your completed survey we will contact you by phone or email within 72 hours or less. We're primarily a volunteer organization, so we appreciate your patience. Please note- Out of respect for our volunteers and staff, we are closed on Sundays and Mondays and will not be processing any applications on that day. Do get back to us right away when we call or email regarding an application so that we can quickly connect using the process below: - A PCH adoption counselor will contact potential adopters within three business days (PCH cannot guarantee any pets availability, but we make every effort to accommodate adopters with a reply and possible alternative suggestions). Counselor and client will then have a conversation to answer questions and determine the suitability of a match (if necessary, we may opt to put adopters in touch with foster parents via a meeting app). We do require that adopters discuss all questions before pickup via phone or email in order to minimize direct contact with our staff/volunteers at the time of adoption.\n\n- After a match is made, clients will be asked to sign our adoption agreement and pay the **adoption fee through our secure website ***Please see our modified no-risk return policy\n- We will promptly email all veterinary & microchip records.\n- The PCH adoption counselor will then set up a specific appointment time to come to our office for drive-in pet pick up!\n- Adopters should bring a pet carrier and leash to pick up. Adult pets will be wearing a collar. It is important that clients arrive on time, neither early nor late.\n- Drive-in Curbside Cuddles adoption! Upon arrival inside the Crossroads Center complex (360 Wylie Drive), turn left and look for PCH signage in the corner, in front of the large blue \"YouthBuild\" sign on the building. Adopters should pull in the driveway and all the way up underneath the large overhang.\n- Adopters must stay in their vehicle. Under no circumstances should clients exit their vehicle, so please be prepared with items such as blankets, paper towels, cleanup spray, garbage bags, etc. Call 309-846-9534 when ready.\n- A PCH representative in protective gear will carry or walk the pet out and place in the client's vehicle. Social distancing practices should be respected during this process.\n- We will take a \"Happy Adoption Day\" photo with family and new pet through the window of the vehicle. Thank you to all for saving the life of a shelter pet! **At this time, we can only accept online payment methods. We are unable to take cash and we do not accept checks. If you typically pay in cash please purchase a pre-paid credit card so you are able to use it to pay online! ***Adopter may return this animal for an exchange or refund within 14 days (Minus a $40 processing fee).

I spent the first 5 years of my life pretty much living alone. I've likely never been pet before, or had the pleasure of knowing a loving human. It has taken me a little while to get use to people, and sometimes they still do really scare me, but I'm learning that people are pretty nice. I love the treats they bring me, and I am really starting to like those pets on my head. I haven't learned to cuddle yet, or to be pet extensively, but it is next on my list. I also want to learn that \"sit and \"walk on a leash trick I see my friends doing. I am a big boy (hey, it's muscles!) and need space to run. I don't know what these \"cats are that people talk about, and I really haven't met many kids so I am not sure how I feel about those little humans. My dream home would be a very patient home, who doesn't mind if I take my time warming up to them and my environment. A home where I could learn how to be a dog, that people are nice, and pets feel good. So, if you are a farmer or just have lots of space and are looking for a very sweet redhead...I am your man!\n\nHis adoption fee is a donation of the adopters choice. \n\nAll Pet Central animals are up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered, micro-chipped (registration included), and current on parasite prevention.

House hippo that is Chapo's former family said that he loves attention and cuddling, and that he was housebroken in their home. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Chapo was nervous at first but opened up quickly and was social with the pups, sweet with the handlers, and easygoing overall. Chapo would like to meet any resident dogs before heading home to make sure it's a good fit. What if his future roomie thinks elephants are the bee's knees, when Chapo knows personally that hippos are where it's at?? Ask about Chapo today!",

            "description": "Moe was a stray pup who found himself in a rural shelter surrounded by countless other dogs, who just like him, have never known what it is like to have a name. Moe is the name that we gave him, as he did not have one in the shelter. All of the dogs are known as, \"Boy\" or \"Girl,\" and while this guy will never complain about staff calling him \"Good Boy,\" he can't help but dream for the day he finds himself with a family who will give him a name he doesn't have to share with every other dog around him! Now Moe is with a foster, while he waits for his transport date to Colorado to find his forever home! Moe is super loving in his foster home. He loves going on walks, and playing with his foster doggy brothers! He is very social and loving.\n\nMoe is likely a Border Collie/Cattle Dog mix, according to the vets. With almost any rescue though, breed is\u00a0\u00a0just a guess! Moe is about 1 to 2 years old, and weighs 60 lbs. He is truly a gentle \"giant\", though he is not that big! \n?\nWith any rescue, moving from a shelter to a foster to an adoptive home can be very confusing. When an adopting family is sensitive to the challenges of change and acclimation for these dog's, the transition is far easier. A home with a very loving and nurturing family that understands that blossoming takes time would be perfect home for Moe. Socialization, pure love and belly rubs is a gift to a dog that is undergoing a life change. Given the time and space, these dogs shine.\u00a0\n?\nFarfel's Rescue has found over time (we've rescued more than 3,000 dogs over 15 years of rescue) that families that attend level 1 group training classes or address individual challenges at home with one of our approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers keep their dogs for life. Dogs that do not get proper training and socialization have a much higher risk of developing behavioral problems. There is a bonding that occurs through the training process that can't be duplicated. It also teaches behaviors that enable a dog to go out into the world with excellent manners that create a very respectful relationship between dogs and their humans. It is for all these reasons that Farfel's isn't willing to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to create this training relationship. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/ force-free trainers in your area.\u00a0\n?\nMoe is up to date on his shots, but has yet to be neutered. Farfel's will cover all costs of Moe's neuter! Neuter must be done within one month of adoption. Any adopter who adopts an unfixed dog will be legally considered a foster until the spay/neuter procedure is complete!\n?\nMoe is arriving on transport in Boulder on 2/10/2021. Applications are currently being accepted for our wonderful pup. If interested in this gorgeous, very cuddly/sweet and loving best friend, please fill out an application completely at\u00a0http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/\u00a0and submit.\n?\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at\u00a0farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving puppy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.\n",

            "description": "During the course of routine examination and treatment, your new pet was found to have Percussion abrasion on tail (Happy Tail) Treatment: Varies Special considerations or instructions: This dog has a common condition found in shelter dogs called happy tail. This results from the dog constantly wagging the tail and hitting the walls of a run. Some dogs, usually with shorter fur, wag their tails vigorously and repeatedly hit objects with the tip. The speed of the tail can result in a very hard impact on surfaces so that some dogs end up literally beating their tail bloody. Dog kennels are often narrow enough and dogs who orient towards people tend to spend their time standing in their kennel near the wall closest to the room's door so that they cannot avoid hitting their tail and causing bleeding. There is no universal treatment that works for every dog. Treatments include bandaging the tail and moving the dog to a bigger run. Fortunately, most dogs improve by leaving the shelter and living in a home. Most dogs in homes do not have this problem and any remaining wounds will heal in a home environment. A very few dogs continue to injure their tails in their new home. These dogs may require tail amputation to solve the problem. Fortunately, this is extremely rare.",

            "description": "Homer was a stray on the streets of Memphis like so many others but he was lucky in that he wandered right up to the house of someone who didn't ignore him. Some nice people took him in, gave him a bath, dinner and then they called a local rescue in the area.\n\nHomeris settling in to his foster home and learning his new routine. This boy takes commands nicely - sit is his favorite!! So far he's doing well in his kennel and not doing his outside business inside! He's a medium energy, well behaved boy. He's learning leash walking as he pulls a bit.He may be a boy who gets car sick but we'll have to get back to you on that! \n\nHe is being introduced to other dogs and doing well. We will post updates as we get to know this sweet guy!\n\nName: Homer\nSex: Male\nBreed: Hound/Pit Bull Terrier\nAge: 2 years estimate\nWeight: 63\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Positive, has started treatment.\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Unknown\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

He is losing his current home through no fault of his own. Felipe's person is in failing health and no longer able to care for him. He was very happy as a constant companion to his retired mom. To ease his transition, we would like to find Felipe a home where he has a similar setup to his previous home -- as an only dog in a quieter home. He is housebroken and walks well on a leash. He's been living in an apartment. If you'd like to meet this adorable boy, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.This guy is River! He is a four-year-old beagle, a chunky monkey, and he needs a home. Because River has demonstrated resource guarding of his food around both other dogs and children, we need to be very careful with his placement. River is neutered, micro chipped, current with rabies vaccine, and we will check him for heartworms and tickborne diseases. Once we get to know more about him we will be happy to post that information. His interesting coloring on his back is due to recovering from a spider bite! It certainly adds to his unique appeal!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This pet has been posted by Friends of Campbell County Animal Control, Rustburg, VA. For questions about the pet, please email us at FOACinfo@gmail.com. All adoptions begin with an application, found under the \"Animals\" tab on our website, friendsofcampbellcounty.org. *Unaltered babies under the age of six months can be adopted only to residents of Campbell County, the City of Lynchburg, and counties touching Campbell County. *Unaltered adult pets six months or older will need to be sterilized before they can be adopted outside our local area of Campbell County, the City of Lynchburg, or counties touching Campbell. *We do not promote dog adoptions to homes where an invisible fence is the fencing of choice. *We do not permit cats or kittens to be declawed following adoption.",

            "description": "Breed: Rough Coated Patterdale Terrier (Fell Terrier)\nSex: Male\nDOB: ~12/29/2017\nWeight: 32 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium-High\nPersonality Type: Sweet, Timid, People-Oriented, Treat Motivated, Playful!\nHistory: Transferred from another shelter\nGood With: Kids 8+ years, Dogs\nIdeal Home: Active home willing to work with Jacques on his leash manners!\nFence Requirements: Required\nSpecial Info: Jacques has a low-shed wirey coat!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

He looks more like a lab mix to us, but we are not the vets.  Panda is a 3 year old young dog, a great size at 50 pounds.  He is very smart and will sit for treats and even stand on his hind legs for them.  A firm owner who does not let Panda get over-stimulated will help him reach his true potential.  Panda likes other dogs.   He will come to you with all of his vet services.  Do yourself a favor - adopt this dog!",

He took a few days to warm up to his foster family but now he sticks around us like velcro. He's taken some notes from our lazy couch potato dog and he's starting to love his belly rubs and nap time. He sleeps through the night in a crate but will start to stir in the early morning. He's also happy to plop into bed with us and sleep like a log!\n\nHe was initially very 'into' our female dog but since his neuter he respects her personal bubble. Early on he had a couple of accidents in the house but he's generally been good about keeping his business outdoors. He loves his walks and he's well-behaved on the leash to boot.\n\nHe's a skinny little thing so we've been adding some healthy snacks like chicken and rice along with his kibble so that he puts on a few pounds, which he's been very happy about!\n\nSam is a good little pup who gets along with the other dogs and people he's been introduced to (unsure about cats). He'd be a great addition to any household, especially one with other dogs that he can go on walks and play with.\n\nSamus is a Male Long-haired Dachshund/Terrier Mix that we estimate to be around 4 years old and weighs 13 lbs.",

Things I love: following my foster mom around like a shadow, chew toys, shoes, treats, and napping on the couch next to my people. Foster mom says I'm the perfect mix of a playful yet laid-back puppy. I'm doing well with potty training and since I'm a small young pup, I need to be let out fairly often. I am not a fan of my crate and would much rather sleep next to my person but we are currently working on crate training. I get along well with the other dogs in my foster home and would love to give you snuggles and puppy kisses if you adopt me!\n\nKimmy is a female German Shepherd/Terrier mix that we estimate to be born around 10/20/2020 and currently weighs 7 lbs (as of 2/1).",

Thank you!** \n\nHere's Kenra, an 18-month old, 33-pound, Yellow Lab/Hound mix young lady, who is a bundle of energy.\n\nKenra  is one of the friendliest gals around.  She loves the company of humans and is eager to please them. She enjoys following her foster family around and staying close to where they are. She likes \"talking\" to them a lot as well.\n\nShe has an amazing sense of smell and will literally follow a scent for hours.\n  \nAnd she loves adventures and trying out lots of new activities. She\u2019s energetic and athletic and will enjoy hiking, camping and swimming.\n\nShe\u2019s tailor made for an active family who loves to have fun and has the time to train a young, energetic dog.\n\nKenra had heartworm when she first came into foster care, but has been treated and has recovered and is now well.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Kenra, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted.

He enjoys lap cuddles, sleeping on the couch, and short walks throughout the day to get some fresh air. He is not a fan of the rainy weather and is loving his warm jacket to help him.

The first step in our adoption process is to fill out an adoption application at www.snarrnortheast.org. PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO & FAQs BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Ferdinand\n*Age: 5 months\n*Current Weight: 43 pounds\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $495 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: up to date on puppy shots so far (adopter will be responsible for remaining puppy vaccinations)\n\nThis handsome, sweet boy is very special and he is looking for his perfect home.  Ferdinand was born onto a property with several dogs living on chains.  But several ladies banded together to free him from this certain destiny of living on a chain.  We are always said to leave dogs to live this life but grateful to have this super sweet boy in our care and ready to find his perfect home.  Ferdinand is a sensitive boy, he's great with other dogs and kids.  Of course, the kiddos at his level better be ready for some puppy kisses.  Ferdinand sleeps on his bed by his foster's bed.  He loves toys, belly rubs and sharing time on the sofa with his people.  He is a big puppy so we expect him to be a big boy.  Ferdinand is doing great with his potty training.  Ferdinand is looking for a home with a fenced in yard and another friendly canine to play with would be awesome.  If you are looking for a big snuggle buddy that will melt your heart this Valentine's day, Ferdinand is your boy. \n\nFerdinand was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. He will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on January 17th ready for adoption! \n\nIMPORTANT: This puppy has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nTo apply to adopt a puppy from this litter, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications.  \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\nWe do recommend listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice when applying for puppies with several littermates.\n(Littermates: )\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n",

He is 2 to 3 years old. We found Clifford laying on the floor of a kill shelter near the Mexico border. He was crippled and could not walk so we rescued him and took him to our vet. We discovered that Clifford had two broken legs on opposite sides of his body. His x-rays were sent to a specialist who is an expert in plate repairs and he agreed that he could help Clifford. He has had his surgery and as you can see in the video, doing remarkably well! He will be released for full activity on Feb 8th and we can't wait to see him running full speed through the yard. Clifford loves everyone so would make a great addition to any family.\n\nFor more on Cliffords story, please view our Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/TracysPawsRescue\n\n\nClifford is located in a wonderful foster home in San Antonio. We will arrange a time to meet Clifford once your application to adopt him has been approved.  He is neutered, up to date on all shots, microchipped and his adoption fee is $300.  If you would like to add Clifford to your family, please complete an application here-\n\nhttps://www.tracyspawsrescue.org/adoption-application\n\nServices our dogs receive prior to adoption:\nChagas Testing\nHeartworm Testing (age appropriate)\nTick Illness Testing (age appropriate)\nAll age appropriate vaccines\nHeartworm and flea/tick preventatives \nSpay/neuter surgery \nMicrochip\n\n* The breed(s) listed are guessed and based on the dog's physical appearance *\n",

If after reading Milo's post, you are interested in adopting him, please contact his owner directly as listed in this post. \n\nMilo\n4 years old\nNeutered male\n24lbs\n\nPer owner: \nMilo is a very sweet and energetic dog. He would do well in a home with a backyard for him to play in everyday. His new owner must be vigilant on walks. Milo is reactive towards other dogs. If he's running or distracted when the dog is approaching, he will be fine. He has recently become reactive towards our other dog in our home and even started to bite so he NEEDS to be the only dog in the home. He has never been aggressive towards people though and will give kisses to all who accept them. He is also quite good at giving hugs and is easily stimulated with toys and bones. There is no doubt that whoever adopts him will fall in love with him as his owners have. \nIf you can meet Milo's needs and you can give him a home where he can be the only dog, please contact Melissa at mrparker192@gmail.com",
