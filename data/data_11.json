            "description": "Debbie is a 5-8 pound 2-month-old Goldendoodle/Coonhound mix with a lot of spunk and personality. This clever little girl wants to be anywhere people are and tends to stray from her siblings and marches to the beat of her own drum. Debbie is extremely loving with a desire to be held and cuddled by humans. She is the perfect pup for anyone who wants a partner in crime and a Netflix cuddle buddy. Debbie will probably grow to be 45-60 pounds and has been fostered with her littermates, a large dog, and a small dog. Her adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

I'm hoping a nice new family will fall inlove with me and take me home!!\n\nSince I was a stray the people here at the shelter don't know about my past.  Since coming to the shelter I am now up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and I also have a microchip.  \n\nI love going for walks and getting to explore the neighborhood.  I'm hoping that my new family will take me on lots of adventures with them!!  Are YOU that special someone I'm waiting for??  Come meet me at the shelter, I'll be excited to get to know you!",

She can do OK with one male dog approximately her size or larger but no females. Wiggles has a lot of battle scars from being stuck in the trixie foundation.  Wiggles is a very sweet dog with people, very sweet. She has a lot of love for people but sadly because of the situation she was trapped in, she developed behavioral issues. It was literally dog eat dog out there in that mud pit. It's a wonder more of the dogs did not have these issues.  We take care of all medical for her. She must remain inside Kentucky until the court case is resolved. If you have a suitable home and would like to try her as a foster, let us know!",

So get those cuddles when you can!\n\nOpie is a smart pup - he knows sit, stay, down and wait commands. He loves chewing on toys but had never chewed anything else.\n\n\nOpie has lived in a household with a cat but the cat mostly ignored him. We are not sure how Opie does with other dogs so a Meet and Greet is highly recommended.\n\n\nOpie would be best suited in a household without young (toddlers) children because of his energy level.\n\nAs long as Opie is on the website he is available.

To meet BRUTUS, see the contact information below.\n\nBrutus is a beautiful, sweet 1-year-old Shepherd/Akita mix who was rescued off the streets of Tijuana. He is a lot of dog, but in a good way. Brutus is a neutered male and weighs about 75 lbs.\n\nHe is very inquisitive, eager to learn, and ready for fun. He is calm, playful, and loving, yet protective. He gets along well with other dogs and people. Brutus is housetrained and knows how to use a doggie door. He would be great with an individual or family who is active. He is ready to learn new things and he loves to ride in the car.\n\nIn addition to being neutered, Brutus has been wormed, microchipped, and is up-to-date with his Distemper/Parvo, Bordetella, and Rabies shots. He has been given Nexgard flea treatment.\n\nAn application for adoption will be requested, along with a video of your yard. There is a rehoming fee, and medical records will be provided. To meet Brutus, call, email or text PAM: 619.964.1181; email address is Pam.Lawless@gcccd.edu. This pet is being fostered in the East County of San Diego.\n\n",

He is very adventurous and a pretty slick escape artist when he's sure no one is watching. Ian loves to play and would do best in a home with a yard that allows him the freedom to run. He is a very sweet puppy that will probably grow to be 55-70 pounds. Ian has been fostered with his littermates, a large dog, and a small dog.  His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

The people who lived in the home that he had decided to call home were afraid of him.  Imagine our surprise when we arrived and saw this exquisite coonhound!  He is the sweetest happiest boy.  I don't know how anyone could be afraid of this love bug!!!!  \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have!

He is looking for a home of his own.\nShe is a strong willed guy who is working hard on his house training and loves to be social! Klaus absolutely loves affection and humans! He is currently in a foster home with an adult dog that he is 100% respectful of. She is helping him learn appropriateness and boundaries.. but his foster mom is also utilizing positive reinforcement training. This will also be a must for his forever home. We want to ensure that Klaus grows up to be the best breed ambassador and working with him on the puppy behaviors now is a key component to a healthy minded adult pitbull. \n\nWe would love to see him in a home financially and emotionally ready for the first years of puppy hood and all that it brings! Training and education are very important part of this and if you cannot afford training currently then a strong willed pup like Klaus would not be the best fit for your home. He is quite the love bug and would love to meet and greet with you.\n\nAdoption Process: PLEASE READ!\nKlaus has a $300 adoption fee.\nAnyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. This site is updated weekly so if an animal is listed they are available for adoption. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. If you live outside of the Tri-County area we will do our best to accommodate a home visit but it will rely on the availability and volunteers at that time. At this time we cannot do out of the state adoptions. We also do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible! We pride ourselves in responsibly placing animals in homes that are best fit for their needs.\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

She resource guards, hogs all the toys and is somewhat pushy. She is a very active dog. We noticed her pics at trixie tended to show her with her back to the fence or wall so she could watch everything and everyone. It was like she was always on high alert. Birdie did not engage in a lot of the fights. She had practically no scars but she was injured shortly before seizure as she had a pretty bad bite wound on her leg.  That does not make her sound too appealing, does it? The other side of Birdie is wonderful. She is loving with people, she likes to lay by your feet, she likes to have your attention, she takes treats out your fingers so nicely. She is also cat safe. She plays with cats quite well. And she is gorgeous.  Right now, Birdie is back in boarding. If you think you would like to foster her, please reach out! She must stay in Kentucky until the court case is resolved. We take care of her medical. She is spayed, UTD on vaccines, and on flea and tick and heartworm prevention. Birdie suffered at trixie. She is a highly intelligent dog that was trapped at the Gulag Of Despair. It is no wonder she has some issues. She just needs the right person and the right environment.",

His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

I was brought to the shelter because my former family could no longer care for me.  So now I'm here hoping that someone like YOU will take me home and love me forever!\n\nI'm a very friendly girl and I love people!  I also do well with other dogs, but we don't know how I feel about cats yet.  Before I go to my new home I will be up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and will also have a microchip.\n\nLike any good hound, I LOVE to go for walks and follow where my nose takes me.  I'm hoping to find a fun new family who will take me on lots of adventures with them!\n\nAre YOU that special someone I'm waiting for??  Come to the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!",

I can be a bit shy at first, but I'll warm up once I know you and want to be best friends! I can jump on a couch but don't like too (remember I'm full-figured). I'm not a fan of being picked up (it scares me), but I'm very happy sitting close by my person on the floor. I'm very smart. I learned how to use a doggie door on my very first day in my foster home just be watching the other doggies go in and out! Now I use it all of the time! I am housebroken, microchipped, spayed, heart worm negative, and current on my vaccines. Looking for a great pet? Pick me! Contact info@rockwallpets.com for more info or to arrange a meeting.",

Laya is a 35 pound terrier/shepherd mix (or so we think). Laya has big ears, short black hair, and a precious little snout. Laya is 3 years old but still full of energy. She will need an active home to keep her exercised and happy. Laya is good with other dogs, but is a dominant player so needs a submissive fur-sibling or to be the only dog. Laya has not met cats and due to her energy level would be best in a home with older kids. Laya is currently in boarding so we cannot say whether or not she's housebroken. She is crate trained and does pretty well on a leash. Layla's adoption fee is $250. This includes her spay, microchip, heart worm test (negative), flea/tick/heart worm prevention, vaccines, and dewormer. Please fill out an adoption application at www.pawsandprayers.org if interested in meeting Laya as it's the first step in our adoption process.",

Before she was left at the shelter, she had given birth and was removed from her litter. She has had a full vet visit and is spayed. She is extremely kind and good with both adults and children, and is nonaggressive towards other animals. She is house trained, she know the basic commands of sit and lay down, and is not opposed to sleeping in her crate. She gets along well with other dogs and even children. Her ideal home would be one where she could receive a lot of attention and care.\n\nIf interested in adopting Lucy, please contact Kevin at 786-493-3032\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

She is in a foster home with other dogs and is utilizing positive reinforcement training. This will also be a must for her forever home. We want to ensure that Jovie grows up to be the best breed ambassador and working with her on her puppy behaviors now is a key component to a healthy minded adult pitbull. \nWe would love to see her in a home financially and emotionally ready for the first years of puppy hood and all that it brings! Training and education are very important part of this and if you cannot afford training currently then a strong willed pup like Jovie would not be the best fit for your home. She is quite the love bug and would love to meet and greet with you.\n \nAdoption Process: PLEASE READ!\nJovie has a $300 adoption fee.\nAnyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. This site is updated weekly so if an animal is listed they are available for adoption. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. If you live outside of the Tri-County area we will do our best to accommodate a home visit but it will rely on the availability and volunteers at that time. At this time we cannot do out of the state adoptions. We also do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible! We pride ourselves in responsibly placing animals in homes that are best fit for their needs.\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

            "description": "Fiona is a 4-6 pound 2-month-old Goldendoodle/Coonhound mix who will melt your heart at first glance. She is the smallest one in her litter but does a good job of standing up for herself against her rowdier siblings. When meeting new people she can be very shy and timid, but once she's warmed up with a new person she is all cuddles. Fiona will probably grow to be around 45-60 pounds and would do wonderful in a home that allows a fair amount of play-time and socialization. She has been fostered with her littermates, a large dog, and a small dog. Her adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Abigail, I'm a 3 year old couch potato. Okay, so I do like going on walks, but mostly I would like to be laid out on your comfiest spot cuddling my soft toys. I like to be wrapped in blankets and stay very still so you have no idea I am there. I am very loving and love to take naps with you. I can be hugged and will snuggle as close to you as I can whilst we sleep together. I love cuddly toys and am very gentle with them - I like to mother them and will carry them around so I can sleep with them. I know commands like sit', down and stay. I am cool with other dogs and used to live with more than 10+ in my old home, but I think ideally I would like to be the only princess in your house, please. People say I am very laid back and easygoing. Abigail is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations and microchipped. She is heartworm positive (not contagious to people or other animals) however the treatment for this is covered through our veterinarian. If you are interested in adopting Abigail or any of our other adoptable pets, please call our shelter at (985) 809-0183 to ask more questions or set up a private appointment. YES you can adopt if you live out of state, we do require you make the trip to us in person so Abigail and our staff can meet you. Her adoption fee for February is 10$, otherwise our adoption fee's are regularly $65.",

Ginger is a gentle soul who is looking for a nurturing home where she can continue to come out of her shell. Ginger\u2019s signature place to spend her says is curled up on the couch or in the bed. She loves long relaxing naps and is slowly but surely getting the hang of walking outside on her leash. Ginger is not a natural city dog and will thrive in a suburban home with a backyard. She loves the company of other dogs and would love to have a furry sibling. We think Ginger could make a good family dog based on her calm and gentle demeanor. If you are looking for a loyal best friend and a warm cuddle buddy, look no further, Ginger is your girl! \n\nGinger is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations. For more information about her, please fill out an application at www.ALRcares.com and email Leanna@alrcares.com. We schedule meet and greets for approved adopters only, an application is the first step in our approval process. Thank you!\n\n",

In his former home, Beau lived with a 12 year old child and did well, and also spent time with another large dog that temporarily came to stay with his family. Beau is housetrained and his former family said he's a great, friendly, quiet dog. In play group, Beau was social with the other dogs, initiating and engaging in play with several other pups. Beau is just a young guy, but he'd love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If he sounds like the dog for you, put down that mint julip and make an appointment to meet him today.",

She can do OK with one male dog approximately her size or larger but no females. Wiggles has a lot of battle scars from being stuck in the trixie foundation.  Wiggles is a very sweet dog with people, very sweet. She has a lot of love for people but sadly because of the situation she was trapped in, she developed behavioral issues. It was literally dog eat dog out there in that mud pit. It's a wonder more of the dogs did not have these issues.  We take care of all medical for her. She must remain inside Kentucky until the court case is resolved. If you have a suitable home and would like to try her as a foster, let us know!",

So get those cuddles when you can!\n\nOpie is a smart pup - he knows sit, stay, down and wait commands. He loves chewing on toys but had never chewed anything else.\n\n\nOpie has lived in a household with a cat but the cat mostly ignored him. We are not sure how Opie does with other dogs so a Meet and Greet is highly recommended.\n\n\nOpie would be best suited in a household without young (toddlers) children because of his energy level.\n\nAs long as Opie is on the website he is available.

To meet BRUTUS, see the contact information below.\n\nBrutus is a beautiful, sweet 1-year-old Shepherd/Akita mix who was rescued off the streets of Tijuana. He is a lot of dog, but in a good way. Brutus is a neutered male and weighs about 75 lbs.\n\nHe is very inquisitive, eager to learn, and ready for fun. He is calm, playful, and loving, yet protective. He gets along well with other dogs and people. Brutus is housetrained and knows how to use a doggie door. He would be great with an individual or family who is active. He is ready to learn new things and he loves to ride in the car.\n\nIn addition to being neutered, Brutus has been wormed, microchipped, and is up-to-date with his Distemper/Parvo, Bordetella, and Rabies shots. He has been given Nexgard flea treatment.\n\nAn application for adoption will be requested, along with a video of your yard. There is a rehoming fee, and medical records will be provided. To meet Brutus, call, email or text PAM: 619.964.1181; email address is Pam.Lawless@gcccd.edu. This pet is being fostered in the East County of San Diego.\n\n",

            "description": "Ian is a 5-8 pound 2-month-old Goldendoodle/Coonhound mix whose favorite part of the day is seizing any opportunity to nibble on those pesky toes. He is very adventurous and a pretty slick escape artist when he's sure no one is watching. Ian loves to play and would do best in a home with a yard that allows him the freedom to run. He is a very sweet puppy that will probably grow to be 55-70 pounds. Ian has been fostered with his littermates, a large dog, and a small dog.  His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

He is looking for a home of his own.\nShe is a strong willed guy who is working hard on his house training and loves to be social! Klaus absolutely loves affection and humans! He is currently in a foster home with an adult dog that he is 100% respectful of. She is helping him learn appropriateness and boundaries.. but his foster mom is also utilizing positive reinforcement training. This will also be a must for his forever home. We want to ensure that Klaus grows up to be the best breed ambassador and working with him on the puppy behaviors now is a key component to a healthy minded adult pitbull. \n\nWe would love to see him in a home financially and emotionally ready for the first years of puppy hood and all that it brings! Training and education are very important part of this and if you cannot afford training currently then a strong willed pup like Klaus would not be the best fit for your home. He is quite the love bug and would love to meet and greet with you.\n\nAdoption Process: PLEASE READ!\nKlaus has a $300 adoption fee.\nAnyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. This site is updated weekly so if an animal is listed they are available for adoption. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. If you live outside of the Tri-County area we will do our best to accommodate a home visit but it will rely on the availability and volunteers at that time. At this time we cannot do out of the state adoptions. We also do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible! We pride ourselves in responsibly placing animals in homes that are best fit for their needs.\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

She resource guards, hogs all the toys and is somewhat pushy. She is a very active dog. We noticed her pics at trixie tended to show her with her back to the fence or wall so she could watch everything and everyone. It was like she was always on high alert. Birdie did not engage in a lot of the fights. She had practically no scars but she was injured shortly before seizure as she had a pretty bad bite wound on her leg.  That does not make her sound too appealing, does it? The other side of Birdie is wonderful. She is loving with people, she likes to lay by your feet, she likes to have your attention, she takes treats out your fingers so nicely. She is also cat safe. She plays with cats quite well. And she is gorgeous.  Right now, Birdie is back in boarding. If you think you would like to foster her, please reach out! She must stay in Kentucky until the court case is resolved. We take care of her medical. She is spayed, UTD on vaccines, and on flea and tick and heartworm prevention. Birdie suffered at trixie. She is a highly intelligent dog that was trapped at the Gulag Of Despair. It is no wonder she has some issues. She just needs the right person and the right environment.",

He is a social and content puppy, happy to chew on his sibling's ears or hang out on your lap while you read a book. Lip will probably grow to be around 55-70 pounds. He is eager to learn and please his humans and would do best with a forever home ready to give training and guidance to this young pup. Lip has been fostered with his littermates, a large dog, and a small dog.  His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

I was brought to the shelter because my former family could no longer care for me.  So now I'm here hoping that someone like YOU will take me home and love me forever!\n\nI'm a very friendly girl and I love people!  I also do well with other dogs, but we don't know how I feel about cats yet.  Before I go to my new home I will be up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and will also have a microchip.\n\nLike any good hound, I LOVE to go for walks and follow where my nose takes me.  I'm hoping to find a fun new family who will take me on lots of adventures with them!\n\nAre YOU that special someone I'm waiting for??  Come to the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!",

I can be a bit shy at first, but I'll warm up once I know you and want to be best friends! I can jump on a couch but don't like too (remember I'm full-figured). I'm not a fan of being picked up (it scares me), but I'm very happy sitting close by my person on the floor. I'm very smart. I learned how to use a doggie door on my very first day in my foster home just be watching the other doggies go in and out! Now I use it all of the time! I am housebroken, microchipped, spayed, heart worm negative, and current on my vaccines. Looking for a great pet? Pick me! Contact info@rockwallpets.com for more info or to arrange a meeting.",

Laya is a 35 pound terrier/shepherd mix (or so we think). Laya has big ears, short black hair, and a precious little snout. Laya is 3 years old but still full of energy. She will need an active home to keep her exercised and happy. Laya is good with other dogs, but is a dominant player so needs a submissive fur-sibling or to be the only dog. Laya has not met cats and due to her energy level would be best in a home with older kids. Laya is currently in boarding so we cannot say whether or not she's housebroken. She is crate trained and does pretty well on a leash. Layla's adoption fee is $250. This includes her spay, microchip, heart worm test (negative), flea/tick/heart worm prevention, vaccines, and dewormer. Please fill out an adoption application at www.pawsandprayers.org if interested in meeting Laya as it's the first step in our adoption process.",

Before she was left at the shelter, she had given birth and was removed from her litter. She has had a full vet visit and is spayed. She is extremely kind and good with both adults and children, and is nonaggressive towards other animals. She is house trained, she know the basic commands of sit and lay down, and is not opposed to sleeping in her crate. She gets along well with other dogs and even children. Her ideal home would be one where she could receive a lot of attention and care.\n\nIf interested in adopting Lucy, please contact Kevin at 786-493-3032\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

She is in a foster home with other dogs and is utilizing positive reinforcement training. This will also be a must for her forever home. We want to ensure that Jovie grows up to be the best breed ambassador and working with her on her puppy behaviors now is a key component to a healthy minded adult pitbull. \nWe would love to see her in a home financially and emotionally ready for the first years of puppy hood and all that it brings! Training and education are very important part of this and if you cannot afford training currently then a strong willed pup like Jovie would not be the best fit for your home. She is quite the love bug and would love to meet and greet with you.\n \nAdoption Process: PLEASE READ!\nJovie has a $300 adoption fee.\nAnyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. This site is updated weekly so if an animal is listed they are available for adoption. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. If you live outside of the Tri-County area we will do our best to accommodate a home visit but it will rely on the availability and volunteers at that time. At this time we cannot do out of the state adoptions. We also do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible! We pride ourselves in responsibly placing animals in homes that are best fit for their needs.\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

            "description": "Fiona is a 4-6 pound 2-month-old Goldendoodle/Coonhound mix who will melt your heart at first glance. She is the smallest one in her litter but does a good job of standing up for herself against her rowdier siblings. When meeting new people she can be very shy and timid, but once she's warmed up with a new person she is all cuddles. Fiona will probably grow to be around 45-60 pounds and would do wonderful in a home that allows a fair amount of play-time and socialization. She has been fostered with her littermates, a large dog, and a small dog. Her adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Abigail, I'm a 3 year old couch potato. Okay, so I do like going on walks, but mostly I would like to be laid out on your comfiest spot cuddling my soft toys. I like to be wrapped in blankets and stay very still so you have no idea I am there. I am very loving and love to take naps with you. I can be hugged and will snuggle as close to you as I can whilst we sleep together. I love cuddly toys and am very gentle with them - I like to mother them and will carry them around so I can sleep with them. I know commands like sit', down and stay. I am cool with other dogs and used to live with more than 10+ in my old home, but I think ideally I would like to be the only princess in your house, please. People say I am very laid back and easygoing. Abigail is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations and microchipped. She is heartworm positive (not contagious to people or other animals) however the treatment for this is covered through our veterinarian. If you are interested in adopting Abigail or any of our other adoptable pets, please call our shelter at (985) 809-0183 to ask more questions or set up a private appointment. YES you can adopt if you live out of state, we do require you make the trip to us in person so Abigail and our staff can meet you. Her adoption fee for February is 10$, otherwise our adoption fee's are regularly $65.",

Ginger is a gentle soul who is looking for a nurturing home where she can continue to come out of her shell. Ginger\u2019s signature place to spend her says is curled up on the couch or in the bed. She loves long relaxing naps and is slowly but surely getting the hang of walking outside on her leash. Ginger is not a natural city dog and will thrive in a suburban home with a backyard. She loves the company of other dogs and would love to have a furry sibling. We think Ginger could make a good family dog based on her calm and gentle demeanor. If you are looking for a loyal best friend and a warm cuddle buddy, look no further, Ginger is your girl! \n\nGinger is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations. For more information about her, please fill out an application at www.ALRcares.com and email Leanna@alrcares.com. We schedule meet and greets for approved adopters only, an application is the first step in our approval process. Thank you!\n\n",

In his former home, Beau lived with a 12 year old child and did well, and also spent time with another large dog that temporarily came to stay with his family. Beau is housetrained and his former family said he's a great, friendly, quiet dog. In play group, Beau was social with the other dogs, initiating and engaging in play with several other pups. Beau is just a young guy, but he'd love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If he sounds like the dog for you, put down that mint julip and make an appointment to meet him today.",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption form on the website, or email messagemarybeth@gmail.com for any questions! \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/.\n\nMeet June! June is an energetic sweetheart that is looking for her forever family. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center\nLocation: Adoption Center\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

They had some health concerns and were no longer able to care for me, so now I'm here hoping that a nice new family will fall inlove with me and take me home.\n\nThe people here at the shelter have started me on some medicine to help my joints.  I'm an older girl, and my body doesn't work like it used to.  I still like to go for walks though!  I love getting to explore!\n\nI'm hoping to find a quiet retirement home to spend my golden years in.  I would prefer a home without young kids, and I don't care for other dogs or cats so being an only pet is what I would like best.\n\nMore than anything I want to be loved.  Will you open your heart to a senior like me??  I promise I won't chew on your furniture like a little puppy would.  I would be content to nap the day away in a nice warm bed!\n\nI'm up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and I also have a microchip.  All I need now is YOU!!",

I am 3 years old, and I am deaf. I came to rescue after being put on the euthanasia list because I was deaf and no one wanted to take me home with them. Well, bad news for them is that I am AMAZING, good news for someone else, I AM AMAZING!!! Let me tell you a little about my story. Not much is known as to how I ended up in the shelter, but that really isn\u2019t important because I am no longer there! I need to be the only dog in the house because I don\u2019t like other dogs in my space. I do absolutely fine if I\u2019m on a walk being around another dog, but being deaf, it\u2019s hard to figure out what another dogs intentions are, so I just prefer not to have them in my home. I have a cat in my current foster home, and I love to chase him, but not because I want to be his friend. I am trying to catch him, so I can\u2019t have any cats in my home. It\u2019s preferred that I go to a home that has no small kids because of being deaf. Due to not being able to hear, I have to be ever vigilant of my surroundings because it\u2019s the only way to know what\u2019s going on, and little kids can tend to be very active and might not understand that I can\u2019t hear them, so I get stressed out. NOW, let me tell you about all the amazing things about me. I am the worlds biggest cuddle bug and the most loving boy! I love to give the most passionate kisses, that just means a lot of licking lol, and will give you my paw to ask you to cuddle with me. I love to chew on toys, and I am a big chewer, so I will need some toys that can hold up to my chewing abilities. It\u2019s calming for me to have something to chew on. I am fully potty trained and will sleep just fine in my kennel at night. My foster family is working on bell training to help me alert someone that I need to go outside, but I am doing well with a schedule also. My foster family is also working on some sign language that is basic to let me know what we are going to do. Right now I am learning what the sign is for bedtime so that I know to go to my kennel. I am working on my table manners and realizing that the food that is for people is not for me; personally isn\u2019t that every dogs issue lol. I absolutely LOVE my foster human siblings, and I get so excited to see them. It\u2019s going to be very important for me to have slow introductions with people because most of my input comes from my visual perspective, and it\u2019s hard to read people  sometimes, so I just need a few extra moments. I love going for walks, but I pull on my leash because I get so excited, so we are working on how to calm my walking down. Again, everything is visual and smell to me, so I am just trying to figure everything out. I am going to need someone that is SUPER patient with me and wants to take their time with me to get me to learn and adjust to the world. I\u2019ve not had any training before now, so I have just merely existed. This world is scary as it is, and I can\u2019t hear, so it\u2019s a little extra scary for me. If you think that you are up to the challenge, please fill out an application for me and let\u2019s explore this new world together! Until I get to meet you, I will keep working on my sign language and learning all the new things I need to! Forever full of strength, Kratos (UPDATED 01/31/21)",

            "description": "Shila girl is ready to start the search for her forever family! <3\n\n\"Shila is our little spitfire. She has so much sass and personality! She will let you know if she doesn't like something through little growls and barks. She is outgoing and only likes to cuddle a little bit before seeing what trouble she can get into it. She is an explorer and has a slightly more active personality than some of her siblings. If you are looking for a girl with character, Shila is the girl for you! <3\" \n\nShila is a 6 week old female Great Pyrenees mix. She currently weighs about 10lbs. Our best guess is she will top out somewhere in the 70-80lb range. \n\n-Shila has been with us since birth. Her mom Varity came to us heavily pregnant. We are unsure of who her dad was. Varity's former owner believes it was a male Pyr mix who visits sometimes but doesn't know for sure. \n\n-Shila is still a baby. This means her new family needs to be ready to potty train her, work with her on basic manners, and have a lot of time on their hands to help raise her. \n\n-Shila will need proper socialization. Her new family will need to expose her to a little bit of everything. Such as walks, car rides, public outings, visitors, other dogs, etc. \n\n-Shila will not be ready to go home until February 22, give or take a couple of days. Anyone applying to adopt her needs to be able to bring her home close to that date. \n\n-Shila is being fostered in Kiowa, OK. We do not send our dogs on transports or ship them. This means his new family needs to pick him up, even if they are out of state. \n\nThink Shila is the girl for you?! If so, you can apply to adopt her at  https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHer adoption fee is $275. That includes two sets of puppy shots, bordetella, and rabies. She will be micro-chipped, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered, and will be current on heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

            "description": "Frank a 5-8 pound 2-month-old Goldendoodle/Coonhound mix with a ton of energy and loves to be the center of attention. He will climb over all of his littermates and the playpen to get a little extra affection. Frank's favorite pastime is to roll around with his tennis balls all day to work on his pouncing technique. Frank has been fostered with his fellow littermates, a large, and small dog. He will probably grow to be around 55-70 pounds and would do best in a home with a yard and room to explore. His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "I have an Adoption Pending and will be going home soon.  But I hope you will consider one of our other wonderful dogs in need.  Thank you!\n\nJeffery was found by a kind soul in Louisiana.  He is incredibly sweet and everyone who has met him has lost their heart to him!  He is likely a Golden mixed with some Collie and, of course, he is very cute!  He looks like a teddy bear with that fuzzy-wuzzy coat of his!\n\nJeffery is estimated to be about 8-10 months old.  He rides nicely in the car, is decent on a leash, and is good with other dogs.  He is an active fellow and will do well with an adopter who can give him the exercise a young dog needs.\n\nJeffery has been neutered and brought up to date on vaccinations.  He is heartworm negative and micro-chipped. \n\nRescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.  \n\nIf not yet approved for adoption, please visit our website to learn more and to submit an online application:     http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com/adoption-info1.html  \n\nPlease DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com   \n\nThank you!\n \nABOUT OUR RESCUE\nBefore being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. \n\nThe information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.\n\nSGRR ADOPTION FEES - Effective May 1, 2020  (subject to change)\n  \n  $750    Puppy - up to 6 months              \n  $650    Young 6 months - 6 years            \n  $550    Senior 7 - 9  years                       \n  $450    Senior 10 years and older          \n \n  $550    Young Special Needs                \n  $400    Senior 7+ Special Needs                \n\n$1000    Young Bonded Pair                   \n  $900    Senior 7+ Bonded Pair         \n\nA contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their SGRR dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. \n\nMost of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  \n\nPlease be a ray of light for this Sunshine dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a Sunshine dog.\n\nPlease visit our website at: http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com  to learn more about our rescue and to make a Donation to support Sunshine Golden Retriever Rescue.  \n\nTHANK YOU!",

            "description": "Maddy is enjoying long walks. Took her on a 2 mile hike on Saturday and she loved being out in the woods. She is a great sleeper and very quiet. Maddy loves attention and is very affectionate but not at all needy. She will sit for hours with her head in your lap if you let her. She follows commands really well and is totally housebroken. Great with other dogs and seems to do fine with cats -\nwhen we walk and see a cat she doesn't seem too interested\n. She will however chase a squirrel all day. She enjoys running around in a fenced yard. She is playful with toys and wants to tumble with her foster dogs.\nMaddy would be a great addition for any type of family. She is wonderful with kids and also likes to chill out so an older pet owner would enjoy her and find her very easy as well. Those big brown eyes will suck you in for sure! Anyone would be lucky to have her.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hello Buffalo, meet Margo! She is a typical puppy - full of energy and fun, but then she crashes hard and naps quietly. She is incredibly fearless and curious, and enjoys wrestling with her canine siblings and playing tug with toys. Margo would do best in a home with a fenced yard and although she would be happy by herself, she would especially love an active canine sibling! Since Margo is young and would benefit from consistent training, she must go to a home without children under the age of 12.\nMargo is super smart and very food motivated, so she picks up on training concepts quickly! With consistency, patience, and a routine, she is already learning basic manners in no time. She sleeps almost all night quietly in her crate and is starting to bark at the door when she has to go potty. If you think Margo would make the perfect addition to your family, both now and post-Covid, apply today at www.sadiesrescue.org .\n\nPlease keep in mind there are many factors to consider when choosing the right match for a puppy, so an application cannot guarantee adoption. Nor do we work on a 'first come first served' basis, but rather strive to find the best match for the personality of each dog. At the time of adoption, the puppy will be current on vaccinations and deworming. He or she will come with a pre-scheduled appointment at our vet to be spayed or neutered that the adopter is obligated to keep. The puppy will also be microchipped at this time. Our puppy adoption fee is $350 plus a $50 training deposit, which is refunded to the adopter when he or she provides proof of having completed a basic obedience class with their puppy. As part of our adoption process references, both personal and veterinarian, will be checked. Sadie's also requires a home visit before we adopt any of our dogs out; therefore we only adopt to our local WNY region. 2/2/21 7:45 AM",

            "description": "Flokie  is a local owner surrender, He was originally adopted by  a young family 4 yrs ago from the Kootenai Humane Society. He had been transferred up from a high kill over crowded shelter in TX. He got along great with the familie's 3 young children, but as they've aged (both Floki & kids)  , and started having their frineds over, he's become over protective of them, and won't tolerate their friends playing rough, runnning or especially yelling/screaming around the house, and wrestling drives him nuts.   His owners have asked that i find a new home for him, without the bustling househokd containing young children. He prefers a more stable, calm regime, where he can take his naps in peace. He does need daily exercise, and as mush as you can dole out! Dalmations were bred to run alongside carriages pulled by horses, he can go for miles. A runner would be an ideal match for him. He does require a 6' fence. He also has extremely short hair, and not reallyy any on his underside, so cold weather is not his friend. This next bit is from his current owner;  \"Hi I\u2019m Floki! I am 5 years old and looking for a loving home.  I am a very protective of my family.  I need a large, spacious yard & alot of  exercise to be happy.  I\u2019m probably the fastest runner you\u2019ve seen, since a greyhound! I like to stretch out my legs and really cover ground.   I do not do well around young, rambuncious children, super important!!! Adults, and older children, that I know well, are great!  I have all of my shots and am very healthy.   I have never bitten anyone but there have been close calls when the kids get wild around me.  In all other ways, I am a wonderful dog. I love \"couch time\" snuggles and do have an \"off\" button in the house. Outside I like to romp, run, play fetch and show off my amazing athleticism. Im a very good boy in the house. I leave the trash alone and know how to stay on my pet bed. I come with all my vet records. I probably should not be in a home with cats, they seem like they'd be very fun to chase. I'm very curious about them, but my master has never let me come into close contact with one.",

            "description": "MUST be the only dog, NO cats, KIDS 15+ only\n\nADOPTION FEE: $400 www.unbreakabull.com/adopt\n\n Hey there!! Let me introduce myself. My name is Cane, and I sort of have a very sad story, but I know that\u2019s going to change now that I am in rescue. I am 6 years old, and my owner recently passed away. I was left alone and so scared. My owner had family, but they didn\u2019t want to take me in. I was running around the streets for a bit before I found a porch that I thought looked safe, and so I went and sat on it and waited for someone to help me. It\u2019s not known how I ended up running around, but I knew that wasn\u2019t what I wanted. The porch that I found myself sitting on belonged to someone who had a friend that worked in rescue :) They offered to help me find somewhere to go so that I could find my forever home again, and now I am here and so happy. I\u2019ve been here a couple of weeks, and everyone is getting to know me, so let me share with you what I have shared with them so far. I was not neutered, so I can be very dominant at times. I have an appointment scheduled to get that taken care of, so there is hope that I will settle some, but I am going to need a very dominant and strong handler either way. I respond well to men, but I think I would do just fine with a woman that was firm as well, but there can\u2019t be any wiggle room in letting me have my way. I\u2019ve been working really hard on following the rules, and I don\u2019t want to go backwards on that. Don\u2019t let having to be firm with me dissuade you from thinking that I don\u2019t love to snuggle and be funny because I do! I absolutely love a good cuddle session on the couch or the floor. Now, it is assumed that I have never been kenneled before because I absolutely hate that thing. It\u2019s a no go for me, but I do very well when I have just a small space that I can be in. They are still trying to get me to at least understand that the kennel is a safe and good thing, but I\u2019m not having it. Due to being so dominant, I need to be the only dog, and there can\u2019t be any cats in my new home. I am a stockier guy, and bossy, so younger kids are not an option for me. The kids in the home need to be 15 and older. They are still learning so much about me, and I am truly working hard, but I am going to be a work in progress for a bit, but I have faith that I will do awesome when I am completely settled and trusting people again. I know that my story seems like a lot and that I come with a lot of rules, but it\u2019s truly to make me the best boy that I can be for the rest of my life. If you are up for the adventure, please fill out my application, and let\u2019s see if we are a great match. Until we can meet, I am going to keep working on my manners and following all the rules and just being the best boy that I can be. Love you all, Cane (UPDATED 01/29/20)",

Roy is getting along with dogs and catsRoy is house and crate trainedRoy is an escape artist if he sees an opportunityRoy is an energetic young adult and enjoys running and play time.Roy will not be a good match for a first time dog owner. He will only placed in a home who has or had dogs before, can provide structure and training and understands how to work with him through his fears. Roy is most comfortable when he is around other dogs so we would love to place him in a home with another canine companion.Roy loves to go on leashed walks but pulls and is a fantastic passenger in the car. If you have a fenced in yard the fence must be a minium of 5' tall.We have enrolled Roy in a 2-week training class starting 01/18/21 to become a more structured boy. He will be able to go to an approved home after 02/01/2021.If you are interested in this sweet face pleace contact his foster at meghan.bprs@gmail.com for more information.",

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nCoral is a lovely 1 year-old Blue Heeler/Lab mix female who was surrendered to a county dog shelter along with five other dogs including her sister Glory. The shelter told us that these dogs had lived outdoors and had limited interaction with people other than the person who fed them. When they arrived at the shelter, they were understandably terrified of everything but the shelter staff and volunteers were very patient with them as they had to get used to so many new things including walking on a leash. Both Coral and Glory made the trip to Canine Lifeline so they could relax in a foster home and get used to indoor life while searching for permanent new homes. We were pleasantly surprised to find when these two arrived here with us that they were not nearly as shy and skittish as we had expected. They still have a long way to go to become confident canines in new situations but Coral seems quite comfortable on a leash now and is getting the hang of crate-training and housetraining in her foster home. Coral is still shy with new people but absolutely loves meeting other dogs. She comes to life when she sees another dog and immediately wants to start playing. We do want to place Coral in a home where she'll have a canine buddy to help boost her confidence and show her the ropes. Given her shyness, she will also need a home with a secure aboveground fenced yard to allow her to play and explore her surroundings safely. Coral will need a person or family who is home much of the time as she will need to continue work on crate-training and housetraining as a puppy would. Lots of trips outdoors during the day are needed as she works on her house manners. If you've got the time and patience to help Coral live her best life, you're sure to be rewarded with a very loyal and devoted companion for years to come. There are no cats in Coral's foster home so we don't know how she would be living with them. Coral weighs about 40 pounds and her adoption fee is $350. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Coral. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Coral and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Charles!\n\nThe GHS family think's I'm awesome because I'm such a loving loyal dog! I'm a very smart boy who knows a lot of commands and tricks. I love attention, chin scratches, catching tennis balls and playing tug with rope toys. I am very food motivated, and I would do anything for a treat! When I'm getting pets I like to lay on my back and stretch my paws straight up into the sky and ask for belly rubs. I am a little older but I'm still very energetic! I love going on long walks where there are lots of things to sniff along the way. I also really love the snow, and get very excited, particularly when rolling around in it, digging in snowbanks or catching snowballs!\n\nMy new family should know that I can be anxious, so it usually takes me a little while for me to warm up a new place or to new people, but once I am comfortable, all I want is to be is by your side! If I'm feeling unsure I take a lot of comfort from my humans, as being beside them helps me feel more confident! I'm usually very well behaved, but sometimes I jump up when I get excited or when I want to play. I'm usually a pretty quiet dog in the house, although I will bark to let you know that someone is at the door or that I see people/dogs outside from the window. I have done well being alone for short periods at home, but I am not comfortable being in a crate, I'd rather be free to find a comfy spot in the house.\n\nI'm really not a fan of other dogs or cats. I prefer to keep my distance outside and be the only animal in the house. Sometimes I bark or growl or try to run at them, so it's best if I'm given a lot of space when they are nearby. My foster mom has been working with me to make me more comfortable when I see other animals and I've made lots of progress! I haven't met any kids, but I would likely be best in a house without small children. It would be best for me to have my own outdoor space like a fenced in backyard, as it can be a stressful experience for me to be around other animals like off-leash dogs. I'm looking for a family that will use positive training methods to help me feel more confident when I am exploring the outdoors and new places with you! If you are looking for a lovable shadow, I'm the dog for you!\n",

            "description": "Hello everyone!  My name is Hugo and I have been waiting for my forever home at the shelter for awhile.  When I came in I was not a happy boy because the people I had been with before had been mean to me.  They had even held me down and used something that burned me to etch an \"X\" on my back!  Can you imagine how that felt?  As a result, I was afraid of hands coming toward me and tried to bite them.  But the people here have been kind to me and I have learned not to be afraid of hands and even enjoy being patted.  I sometimes forget myself and get nippy with sleeves and pant legs and they are teaching me not to do that too.  They have a trainer who would love to work with anyone interested in adopting me to teach them how to be with me.  But because I occasionally forget they say I should not go to a home with small children.\n\nAnd I should mention that I LOVE going for car rides and walks in town. I behave really well when I do that because it makes me happy.  I so look forward to the day when someone will give me a chance and take me home and take me for lots of car rides and walks. And spend time with me so I don't have to be alone so much.  I like some dogs but not all so I should meet any other dog in the family before going home.  And did I mention that I like toys that squeak?\n\nThank you,\nHugo\n\n \n\n",

My name is Porter, and I came to rescue with my sister. I am 6 months old, and I am learning all things puppy that I need to learn. I am learning that my kennel is a good and safe place and that I can be quiet and okay in it and will go there when I hear \u201ckennel up\u201d. I am potty trained and am doing great in telling people that I have to go outside. I know sit and \u201cplace\u201d when I come back in from outside. I am loving getting the chance to play with my foster fur brother. There are foster fur cats at my current home, and I sometimes will chase them, but it\u2019s more out of curiosity. When they have had enough, they will correct me and I listen. I just want them to play with me, but they aren\u2019t seeing things my way. I\u2019m confident that we will be great friends though; well, that\u2019s what I keep telling myself. I love playing with my toys and playing chase. I love snuggling with my foster mom and just being comfy on the couch. When I got to my foster home I wasn\u2019t very confident, and I didn\u2019t want to be away from people because everything scared me. I have been working really hard on this, and I am no longer scared and can do things by myself, and I realize that I don\u2019t have to be right next to someone in order to feel safe. Well, if you are looking for an all around awesome little man, fill out my application, and let\u2019s have a little meet and greet. Until I hear from you, I\u2019m going to go back to trying to get the cat to understand that I love him and just want to play. Love, Porter (UPDATED 01/31/21)",

This sweet and gentle girl is looking for a nurturing home who can help her come out of her shell. Lola is on the shy side at first, but has so much love to offer. She would make a great family dog as she seems to really like kids. She is a pro at walking on her leash outside despite the cold weather. She is warming up more and more every day in her foster home and loves to be pet and cuddled. Bonus, she is almost fully potty trained! If you are looking for a gentle and loving girl with the cutest ears, look no further. Submit your application for Lola today! \n\n Lola is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations. For more information about her, please fill out an application at www.ALRcares.com and email julie.poiesz@alrcares.com. We schedule meet and greets for approved adopters only, an application is the first step in our approval process. Thank you!\n\n\n",

I like to play, especially with smaller dogs the big ones still make me a little nervous, but a calm big dog might help me learn that I won't get trampled on. I am very food motivated and I will make silly sounds if you scratch my sweet spots. I am a little weary of new outdoor spaces, sounds, like those big scary trucks make, and sometimes I get startled easily. I'm looking for a calm and patient human who can help me build confidence and will make me feel big and brave! My ideal home would be away from the hustle and bustle of town. I enjoy a more quiet country setting. If you are looking for a sweet, playful puppy to excite your life and keep you on your toes, come by the humane society and take me home today!",

            "description": "Because we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes. Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nYes, Jemma is stunning, but please read through her very honest bio before deciding she\u2019s your dream dog. She was surrendered with some baggage that will take a special person and a fear-free vet to manage. Jemma is a velcro dog who attaches herself to a limited circle of trusted adults, which is great if you are following social distancing.  She has the typical \u201cprotective\u201d Doberman personality, so previous breed experience is a plus for her success. She wants to have all of the attention to herself and is not a good candidate to live with other dogs or cats. She just turned 5 years old (DOB 11/5/15) and is a bigger gal at 85 lbs. Jemma knows some basic commands, but she would benefit from training to bond and communicate with her new person. Her give-up paperwork says she is housebroken, and she paws at the door to go out. In her foster home, she prefers not to be contained in a crate or x-pen, but she is trusted loose in certain areas with no issues. Jemma enjoyed a 6-foot privacy fence in her previous home and needs one in her new home, so only applicants with a fenced yard (no e-fence) will be considered. Her adopter will appreciate the fence because she pulls on leash. She will also require an obedience commitment, but she may appreciate one-on-one classes.\n\nWhy do the pretty ones always have baggage? Jemma shows some possessive behavior toward human beds, so our trainers recommend she not be allowed on your bed to avoid that behavior. Our vet has also prescribed her daily Prozac, which is helping her deal. During thunderstorms, fireworks, etc., Jemma would also benefit from an additional Rx anti-anxiety medication (Trazadone). At other times, she experiences anxiety attacks and needs to be calmed down, which is another reason why she needs to be the only dog and possibly have a single owner. Jemma can be stubborn and needs to be redirected at times. But she will show her foster dad affection and just loves spending time with him, curled up right next to him on the couch or chair.  Jemma will beg for food, but if ignored, she will walk away and go somewhere else.  She has a bad habit of counter surfing, so she will be good motivation to keep your counters clear. Jemma is a great watchdog, as she will bark at people and dogs walking by, so a single-family home is needed for her to be successful\u2013a townhouse is too close to triggers. She is perfectly fine when left alone and will just curl up on the couch or chair. Like most Dobes, she likes to carry around a stuffed toy to cope with anxiety. If you are a single adult with a fenced yard and no kids, Jemma might be the girl for you!\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

Upon first meet he is very shy and independent and likes to do his own thing, but once he knows you he is a great companion. He would likely require a few visits before he's comfortable interacting freely with new people. Once he warms up, there's nothing Petey loves more than playing with his toys and running around! When he's done playing, you'll often find him curled up in his blankets napping, but he does not like to be disturbed! Due to his initial shyness, Petey's future home must be an adult only home. With a slow introduction and plenty of tasty treats, Petey shows potential to live with another resident dog if they're the right fit. Petey is a spunky pup who's full of personality and can't wait to find his forever home. \n\nIf Petey looks like your partner in crime, give our adoption counselors a call at 234-212-9843 to schedule an appointment to meet him today!",

They are working on going to the bathroom on potty pads, but do have accidents on the carpet from time to time. They need someone who is going to be patient in regards to potty training. Because they are seniors, they like to sleep a lot but get occasional spurts of energy throughout the day. The would do best in a home with someone who is home all day. \n \nAll that being said, Jennie and Jill are absolutely wonderful. They love to cuddle. Jennie is more sassy and Jill more mellow. If you are interested in this bonded pair please fill out an application.\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the Greater Chicago Land area.

            "description": "Hi, I'm Alabama!\n\nDo you like other dogs? I have a good history playing with other dogs! I may do well living with a dog, but I should have a shelter introduction before going home.\n\nWhat do you think about cats? I have an unknown history with cats. I may do okay with a dog savvy cat with slow and careful introductions. \n\nSo how do you feel about kids? I have an unknown history with kids. I may do well with most ages of kids! \n\nWhat's your energy level like? I have a medium to high energy level!\n\nWhat is it that staff and volunteers love about you? I am a super sweet girl who enjoys play time and walks!\n\nIs there anything else we should know about you? I am 2 years old and I weigh between 65-70 pounds. I do have a medical waiver that states I have a broken canine tooth.\n\nI came into the shelter as a transfer and the above information is all recommendations based on my behavior seen at the shelter. I have no known history and it is very likely that I have not shown staff 100% of my personality. Expect to learn more about me after adoption.\n\nMy adoption fee includes my spay/neuter, current vaccinations, permanent microchip identification, certificate for a free veterinary exam, post-adoption support and more!\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! If you think we would be a good match call and ask about me! I'm looking for my forever home and it could be with you!\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION: If you live in the city of Eugene or in Lane County you will be purchasing a dog license in addition to the adoption fee. You will get to choose between a one year, two year, or three year license. \nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503. See all of the pets at this shelter by visiting www.green-hill.org.",

They love to play with each other, their toys and their foster parents! They are crate trained and working hard on potty training. These sweet little puppies can\u2019t wait to meet their forever families! Their adoption fee is $400.00                                                                                                  \n\nPop - Nicknamed \u201cBig Pop\u201d due to being the biggest of the three, Pop is a leader and splits his time between playing with his siblings and cuddling in his foster parents lap!\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "King is a 1.5 year old Great Pyrenees.  He and Princess were strays found wandering in rural MS.  King just wants love. He really enjoys human companionship likely because he never had it before.  He will definitely need some training as he likes to jump right up in your face to be loved on therefore he will not be placed in a home with young children. He also needs some leash work but he is going to make someone a fabulous companion.  King has been around other dogs however we will not place him in a home with another male dog.  He has seen cats at a distnce without issue but has not been around them directly. \n\nIf you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application on our website:                          https://.barkdogfarm.rescuegroups.org/forms/ \n\nBefore applying be sure you have thoroughly researched Great Pyrenees.  They can be stubborn, prone to barking, overly protective and cannot be off leash.  You WILL NOT train a pyr to boundaries.  \nPlease be sure all family members are in agreement to adopting and your family is ready to bring dog home now. \nApplicants must be at least 21 years old. \nA volunteer will be in touch to discuss your application and the dog to determine if it is a good match. Your vet and two references will be called.  A virtual home visit done. Once approved a meet and greet at the farm will take place.  If all are in agreement and the animal has received its NH health certificate an adoption contract will be signed and adoption fee paid.  \nAdoption fees for dogs are $450. for adults over 12 months, $500 for puppies 12 months and younger.  Fees for seniors, special needs or harder to place dogs will be determined by our Board of Directors.\n All dogs will be altered when adoption is finalized, up to date on age appropriate core vaccines, negative for parasites, heart worm and lyme tested if 6 months or older, microchipped and have a current health certificate.  \nProof of a basic obedience course completed is part of our adoption contract within six months. \nOur descriptions are based on shelter evaluations, input from foster homes and interactions with our volunteers therefore are in no way a guarantee of temperment. \n\n! Please know we practice Covid-19 guidelines for mask wearing and social distancing.  Only approved applicants are allowed to meet our dogs outdoors at this time. Please email barkingdogfrm@gmail.com with any questions.",

ACs believe the other dog had been attacking Henry, as he had bite marks and wounds on several spots. He also had a leather harness embedded in his chest. All of this tells us he was neglected and did not receive proper care. The shelter removed the harness and the wounds from it have healed, although he is still growing in fur where he was shaved so the harness could be removed. He is a sweet, loving boy who really enjoys walks and sniffing out the area. He is very motivated to chase small creatures so would not do well in a home with cats, rabbits, or small dogs. However, he gets along with and seems to enjoy the company of bigger dogs. He's a great size -- about 50 pounds -- and would make a loving companion. We aren't 100 percent certain he's house-trained but he is doing well, so we are sure he would be in a short time if he isn't already. He could use some basic training in areas such as sit, down, stay, etc. Henry is a bit scared of the car; we aren't sure what the reason is but his fosters are working on making the car a happy event that doesn't always end at the vet's office.",

I love to run, play with balls (& all kinds of dog toys), chew on my bones, and do all the important puppy stuff- including giving out tons of puppy kisses! I am a puppy, so I will need lots of patience and training so that I can be the best doggy for you! I know how to use a doggie door and get along great with other dogs. I have been around children (7 & 8, and I love spending time with them! If you think you can handle all this sweetness and want an adorable play buddy, I would love to meet you! I am microchipped, neutered and have all my age-appropriate vaccinations. Contact info@rockwallpets.com to learn more about me.",

I'm looking for a a home that allows me to be me, I like other doggies but will probably do best in a household with only one other dog sister or brother and I don't think I'm a fan cats, but I may warm up to them. I'm great with kids but, I don't know my own weight.. I am a Bulldog after all Anyways if you think I'm cute and looking for a snuggle buddy that loves to binge watch old seasons of the Bachelor while eating junk food I'M YOUR GIRL!!\n\nSweet momma bulldog found surrendered to the shelter, looks like she has had a few litters.

I'm afraid of nothing and I blossom under attention, so I'd do best in a family that can understand my vivacious ways and not take offense to the fact that I'm sometimes a wild card. I do genuinely love people but I just tend to put myself first sometimes! Will you be willing to let me bribe you into giving this a shot? \n\nQuinn would do best in a quiet, low traffic, adult home that understands her handling sensitivities. She does not like her rear end handled and she can be very independent one minute and a complete love the next. She just asks that you respect her boundaries and she will be a wonderful, playful companion. She is a PUPS graduate. Her handling is improving with us but she does not like to be pushed and will let you know if she is uncomfortable. Her adopter will need to respect her space and understand when she wants to be left alone. She will come back and solicit affection when she is ready. She's a princess!",

They love to play with each other, their toys and their foster parents! They are crate trained and working hard on potty training. These sweet little puppies can\u2019t wait to meet their forever families! Their adoption fee is $400.00                                                                                                  \n\nCrackle - Crackle is a little comedian who enjoys playing with his siblings and toys, and making his foster parents laugh with his silly puppy antics. This little guy loves to interact! \n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nGlory is a beautiful 1 year-old Lab/Heeler mix spayed female with a very pretty medium-length coat. She was surrendered to a county dog shelter along with 5 other dogs. Apparently, the dogs had lived outside and had limited interaction with anyone other than the person feeding them. When they arrived at the shelter, they were understandably terrified of everything new and had absolutely no idea what to do on a leash. Glory and her sister Coral made the trip to Canine Lifeline so they could relax in a foster home and get used to indoor life while searching for permanent new homes. We were pleasantly surprised when these two arrived as they were not nearly as afraid of everything as we expected they would be. They had obviously gained much confidence during their stay at the shelter but are still going to be works in progress in their new homes. Glory seems happy to meet people although still shy and nervous in new situations. She is doing much better on a leash now and no longer flattens out when a leash is slipped over her head. She will walk but is still quite erratic and all over the place so can easily trip up her handler. Lots of daily practice in a quiet neighborhood will be perfect for her. Urban or high-density suburban life would be overwhelming for Glory so a home in a more rural area or quiet neighborhood is what she needs. Glory has been working on crate-training and housetraining in her foster home and is going to need to continue work on both in her adoptive home. She will need a person or family who is able to manage her like a puppy-getting her outside every hour or two during the day as she understands the house rules. Glory will also need a home with a yard that has a secure aboveground fence to help boost her confidence and keep her safe in a new environment. She does well with most other dogs although having had to fend for herself among a group of dogs has made her a little pushy with them. She will bully her sister over food so if there's another dog in her new home, mealtime will have to be closely managed. That said, Glory would benefit from having a calm, confident canine buddy in her new home to help show her the ropes. This beautiful pup is discovering toys and how much fun they can be-again, something that she likely never experienced before. This diamond-in-the-rough is going to become an outstanding companion for the person or family who has the time and patience to work with a young dog who needs to make up for lost time. Glory weighs about 40 pounds and her adoption fee is $350. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Glory. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there.",

I weight 25 lbs and my foster mom tells me that I am going to be a Runway model.  Tall and beautiful!  \nWe were dropped off at the shelter when we were little babies and my sister Pluto and I have been together all this time. It would be nice if we could stay together since we are thick as thieves. That is how our foster mom describes us.  You know any sisters getting along?  We sure do!\nI love to play, play play and rough house with Pluto. We are really smart and have already learned our manners and we know to go outside to do your business. Our foster mom just claps her hands and we know to come back inside. \nWe just love the snow. As a matter of fact we have been playing in the snow the entire morning. We chase each other and roll and frolic in the snow. Foster mom tells that we better not make a mess when we get back inside. \nI am ready to go to our forever family. I hope my sister and I can go together but that is just my wish. I can't wait to learn everything I need to know to because a Lady. I promise I will put a smile on your face every day of my life and will warm your heart at night. Until we meet, \nLove, \nCash, other wise known as the Runway model.\n\nTo meet Cash please complete an adoption application at www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org\nCash is fostered in New Lenox, IL. Sorry we cannot adopt out of the state of IL.

Ellie gets along great with cats, dogs and children! She loves absolutely everyone! Ellie is living in a foster home right now and enjoys snuggling the other dogs on the couch. Ellie is eager to please and promises to be a great addition to any home! Please ask us all about her!\n\nFor additional information about Ellie #36 please email Shana Luzusky at shana2576@gmail.com. \n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: We receive many questions about our adoption process from potential adopters, most of which can be answered by viewing our \"Adopt a Lab\" page on our full service website, https://labs4rescue.com/.   To expedite the process, please follow the step-by-step instructions outlined and submit an adoption application listing 3-5 dogs of interest. Please hurry as your new best friend is waiting for you!\n\nADOPTION FEES: $445 non-refundable adoption fee for all vet expenses (spay/neuter, shots, etc.) and transportation to ensure your lab gets to you in a safe, professional manner. All fees may be paid using PayPal, cashier's checks, or money orders. Labs4rescue does not accept personal checks for adoption fees. All adopters must pay their Labs4rescue adoption fee prior to the rescue shipping their dog.\n\nResidents of Massachusetts or New Hampshire are required to pay an additional $125 fee, which defrays the cost of their state's mandatory 48 hour isolation and examination by a licensed veterinarian.",

I weight 25 lbs and my foster mom tells me that I am beautiful.  Not to brag but I\u2019m drop dead gorgeous.\nWe were dropped off at the shelter when we were little babies and my sister  Cash and I have been together all this time. It would be nice if we could stay together since we are thick as thieves. That is how our foster mom describes us.   You wouldn\u2019t think sisters would get along so well but we do.  She\u2019s my BFF\nI love to play, play play and rough house with Cash. We are really smart and have already learned our manners and we know to go outside to do your business. Our foster mom just claps her hands and we know to come back inside. \nWe just love the snow. As a matter of fact we have been playing in the snow the entire morning. We chase each other and roll and frolic in the snow. Foster mom tells that we better not make a mess when we get back inside. \nI am ready to go to our forever family. I hope my sister and I can go together but that is just my wish. I can't wait to learn everything I need to know to become a Little Lady. I promise I will put a smile on your face every day of my life and will warm your heart at night. Until we meet.\nLove, \nPluto, other wise known as the drop dead gorgeous. \n\nTo meet Pluto please complete an adoption application at www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org\nPluto is fostered in New Lenox, IL. Sorry we cannot adopt out of the state of IL. Due to the large number of applications we might not be able to get back to you so please check our website for updates on Pluto's adoption status. www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org",

They love to play with each other, their toys and their foster parents! They are crate trained and working hard on potty training. These sweet little puppies can\u2019t wait to meet their forever families! Their adoption fee is $400.00   \n\nSnap - As the only lady of the pack, sweet little Snap is an independent girl who enjoys exploring! She loves to play, cuddle and will melt your heart with her cute little face! \n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

The only difference is Bobby has a bob tail! We can\u2019t believe we found another pup from the same litter! Bobby is arriving this weekend and being fostered with several large dogs in Rosendale. \n\nHe is 8 months old and about 55 pounds! We are told his personality is more confident than his brothers and as you can see he is just as handsome. \n\n\nPlease submit your application for consideration to www.mountainRottierescue.net",

I was brought to CMHS by my former guardian, who wanted to make sure that I found a great home that she unfortunately could no longer provide. From a young age, I was a little nervous around new people. As I grew up, this became what some might call 'stranger danger'. This basically means that I am really unsure when I meet a new person, so I need a very gradual introduction to help me get to know them. But once I know and trust a person, they are my best friend!! As they always say - quality over quantity - right?\n\nIn all seriousness though, this has been a big challenge for me. How am I supposed to find a home when I am not comfortable meeting new people?! Thankfully, I entered the Pawsitive Support Program at CMHS where I learned some really great training skills. I am a rock star a loose leash walking and targeting, if I do say so myself!\n\nPlease give me a chance today and I promise all our hard work will pay off together!",

We think he would enjoy puppy classes so he can learn basic commands (ie: sit, stay, etc.) and to walk properly on a leash so he can go on big adventures with his new forever family. Rembrandt will become a wonderful member of his new forever family with just a little bit of training and a lot of TLC from you!",

When I was a young lad, I walked to doggie daycare uphill both ways.  These days, I prefer a shorter walk and a human best friend who will share my golden years with me.  My foster mom hasn't introduced me yet to children, but so far I've exceeded all of her expectations.  P.S. Will you be my Valentine?\n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $75 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Trixie is a 12 year-young chihuahua mix with the softest coat and so much love and snuggles. She has a scar on her back and a broken jaw (that doesn't require medical attention). Our vet believes at some point she may have been picked up by a predator and dropped. Trixie still has a few years left in her and would love to spend it with a loving family that will spoil her.

            "description": "Kiefer has so many great qualities that we couldn't even possibly name them all! He is a bundle of energy and very much a people dog. He'll love going on any dog-friendly errands with you, happily hopping in the car to go on a ride. He loves going on walks, no matter the weather! Cold or rain doesn't get this happy guy down. Kiefer loves to play and chase after a small tennis ball, and will happily go after it as many times as you're willing to throw it. After some good playtime, Kiefer becomes a little couch potato and loves to snuggle. He is a quick learner and picked up \"sit\" quickly. Overall, Kiefer is a total delight who will make a fabulous companion for some lucky home!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Although Pluto is about knee high, he is a tank!  Pluto came to the shelter as a stray and sadly his family never came to claim him.  As a result, he is looking for an awesome new home.  Pluto is an energetic and fun dog that is looking for a family that can keep up.  He is looking for an experienced home that has lots of time to spend with him and plenty of experience with training.  He loves people and loves to play but needs to work on his obedience skills and leash manners.  Pluto seems to be fond of female dogs but he must find a home without cats or other small animals.  He also loves to snuggle but may be too big and pushy for young children.  If you are looking for a handsome tank to keep you busy, come check out Pluto,\n\nAdoption Fee:  $180.00\n",

Upon arrival at Cedar Bend, Goliath tested positive for heartworms and is currently being treated by CBHS. \n\nAGE: Approximately 4 years. \n\nTRICKS & COMMANDS: Sit\n\nABOUT GOLIATH: Goliath is a sweet man with a very calm demeanor. He can take a little time to warm up to new people and would love a home that's willing to work with him on socialization. \n\nGoliath walks very nicely on a leash and is a huge cuddle bug! He will also take a treat gently and sit on command. Goliath might do best in a home with older children that respect and understand that he can be nervous sometimes. His previous foster told us that he does fine around cats and other dogs but that he prefers females. \n\nGoliath can't wait to find his forever home where he can fully come out of his shell and be a great companion. \n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

            "description": "Are you active, up for some adventure, but also love cuddling on the couch? Then Milo is your guy! Described by his foster as the best guy they have ever met, Milo is wise, gentle, and fun. Milo loves to run, explore the woods, chomp on snow, and cuddle with his toys. Milo is looking for a family that is active, loves being outdoors, will stimulate his mind (he is really smart!), and will treat him like a member of the family.\n\nAge: 3 years old\n\nBreed: Husky\n\nWeight: 60 lbs\n\nKid-friendly: Milo can be a little jumpy, so we are recommending older, considerate children only.\n\nDogs: Yes! Milo is a very mellow dog. He will defer to the \"alpha\" dog in the house, but might get uncomfortable in environments like a dog park, because he is so passive.\n\nCats: Probably not. He has not had experience with cats in a home, but Milo has a very strong prey drive.\n\nCrate trained: No. Milo has ALOT of anxiety being in a kennel. When created, Milo will try to escape the crate, often times injuring his nose. In his foster home, Milo is free to move around the house. He does better if doors are open so he has \"access\" to his people.\n\nPotty trained: Yes!\n\nLikes: Milo loves being outside, eating chicken and rice, running / walking, cuddling at home with his humans, toys, car rides, and marrow bones!\n\nHealth concerns: Milo has had some teeth pulled, and his teeth are not in the best shape. Milo will need regular brushing and dental cleanings.\n\nBehaviors: Separation anxiety. Milo's foster family is working on leaving him alone for short periods of time. They are slowly increasing his time alone, but start to notice signs of SA after 10 minutes. Milo has been destructive when left alone. This is something Milo's adopting family will need to continue to work on, with lots of patience, love, and understanding.\n\nAdoption fee: $425\n\nAdopters will be responsible for continued preventatives, follow-up appointments, and medications (if applicable).\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.",

Bea can be a little shy with new people, but you can win her over with some treats as she loves her food! Bea is about four years old and while we don't know what her past life was like, we believe she was the only pet in the house because she prefers to be the only one to get pampered. However, we are willing to introduce her to a dog that is a similar size and temperament. Bea does have some lipomas (not cancerous) on a couple parts of her body, but they don't bother her one bit! Because they are not hurting her or threatening her life, we have decided it wasn't worth putting her through surgery. She's beautiful with them! If you're interested in meeting this fabulous four year-old, please fill out an application on our website at www.azhartt.org/programs-services/adoptions",

He is a young, energetic mixed breed guy with a beautiful gray -black coat and a curl at times to his tail suggestive of a sled dog...such as a malamute. He has a speckled chest like a heeler! We don't really know his breed, but we do know he is a joyful, loving soul who loves everyone. He's learning quickly basic commands and walks nicely on a leash and rides great in the car. He would be an awesome trail buddy! Call Steve at (505) 705-0099 if you would like to meet Turbo.",

She is very shy and timid at first and she will not allow you to pick her up until she gets to know you better. Once she sees you as her person she is a very sweet little girl and will follow you every where.  She is good with dogs of all sizes (but is not looking for a playmate) and could care less about cats.  We have not seen her around children but because of her trust issues we feel a home without children is best.  She is house broken and rides good in the car.  She takes treats gently and has no food aggression issues.  \n\nUnfortunately, we have some sad news to share.  ?\nWe received the results of Mrs. Peabody's blood work and she has been diagnosed with early stage kidney failure.  Because of this she is not a candidate for anesthesia, so she will not be able to have the surgery to remove the tumor from her backside or to have her dental cleaning/work that she needs.  The vet feels the tumor is not cancerous and it doesn't seem to bother her at all.  For now, the vet has prescribed her some special food to best support her kidneys and we will continue to make her days (however long that may or may not be) as comfortable and happy as possible. \n\nMrs. Peabody will require regular grooming, which will be an added expense for any adopter, but be warned Mrs. Peabody does not tolerate her feet being touched and does not like being groomed. so she requires medication in order to be groomed, which will also be an added cost as well.  \n\nShe is adorable but she is not for every family and we will be choosey as to where she goes.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet little so she can live out her days with her very own family, please fill out an application on our website at fairytails-rescue.weebly.com \n \n\n",

He is good with other small dogs, cats and kids.\n\nDewey is a 1 yr old, 5 pound female Chihuahua who is very sweet but super fearful until she knows you. She is super snuggly and does well with older children.\n\nMalcolm and Dewey are both housebroken and sleep through the night. They are very loving but a bit stunned by their sudden change in circumstances. They just want to find a home together where they can live out the rest of their days feeling safe and loved. Dewey very much looks to Malcolm for security and protection.\n\nBoth are altered and UTD on shots. They are being fostered in Racine, Wisc and their adoption fee is $650 for both which includes micro-chipping.\n\nIf you feel you could give these two sweethearts the loving hone they so deserve, please fill out an application at https://us18.sheltermanager.com/service?account=gd2427&method=online_form_html&formid=32DATCP # 494550",

She's exceedingly smart and already knows how to sit, lay down, wait at doors and for her meals, and is working on giving her toys back so you can throw them again. She is trained to sleep in her crate, though we're still working through the housebreaking process. Moxie lives with a cat and has been well behaved around him.\nMoxie's new home must be one with a physically fenced yard. Electronic/invisible fences will not be considered. No exceptions.\nHer new home must also be one that is willing to commit to two rounds of training classes with an approved trainer or training facility.\nIf you think that Moxie would be a great fit for your family, please head to www.homefurever.com to fill out an application.",

She will try to herd people, dogs, and animals though- so someone who understands herding breeds would be preferred! \n\n She would love to have a yard or an active family. She is an extremely sweet and loving girl! She is housebroken, leash trained, and crate trained. She loves her toys and loves to play! \n\n Chloe is 54 pounds. If interested in this sweet girl please send in an application www.soardogs.org \n\n\nAdoption donation required. This covers altering, DAP series vaccinations to date of adoption, Bordetella Vaccination, Rabies vaccination if over four months, Microchip, Deworming, heartworm test (if over 8 months), monthly flea/heartworm prevention to date, grooming, full veterinary examination, and temperament evaluation. Please e-mail us for more information or go to our website https://soardogs.org/adoption-application for an application. Thank you very much!\u00a0\n\n\nAll SOAR dogs go through a ten-day quarantine period to ensure they are healthy, before being adopted. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis, but screen applicants in order to find the best fit for our adoptable dogs.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.This older lady is easy, sweet and loving. She has had a lifetime of learning how to be a good dog, even though for a long time she was not valued or cared for with love. Her foster says she is outstanding and fit right into her home, as she will to yours, like she had been there all her life. Friendly, happy, outgoing and accepting of whatever comes her way, Cassie could easily be one of the best dogs you have ever had. Her foster says of her ' Cassie loves people and is very affectionate. She walks good on a leash and likes to be outside a lot. She gets along with everyone. She is the best dog ever.' Tell her you will love her and she will be yours forever and ever. It's that easy.\nIf you are interested in Cassie, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://reachoutrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4588 Or contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

He knows the commans sit, shake, down, stay, come, and go night night (go into crate). Winston is food motivated! This makes him easier to train. He is shy when meeting new people so he would do best in a home with no kids. Winston has a lot of energy and needs a backyard to run and play in. He would love another energetic dog to play with. He would make an awesome hiking dog or farm dog. Please fill out an application to meet him!",

He just wants a home he can feel secure in and get lots of love ??. He loves playing with his toys and getting lots of treats. He is house trained and knows basic commands like sit and come.  He seems extra cautious outside.  He may do best with someone that can take time with him outside to learn that nothing bad will happen.  He gets scared when he hears too many noises, so a quieter home might be good.  He also seems to like and do well with a routine.  Still very much a puppy, will jump up on people and he\u2019s still a little mouthy, so will need training.\n\nPlease use\nTo adopt - https://form.jotform.com/92314840069154",

This big eared baby is the German Shepard you have been waiting for. Monique is the ultimate playmate and cuddle bug. She loves to sit on the couch with her toys next to her foster mom and is always up for a game of fetch. At only 8 months old, she has plenty of that fun puppy energy so is looking for an active home. Monique would love a home outside of NYC with a backyard she can stretch her legs in. She is very good on her leash and loves to go for long walks, but can get nervous around other dogs when out and about. She is looking for a cat free home as they are just too much fun to chase. She is very smart and will take to puppy training very well we thing. If you are looking for a happy, friendly, and social dog to brighten up these winter days, look no further Monique is the girl for you. \n\nMonique is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations. For more information about her, please fill out an application at www.ALRcares.com and email Kate@alrcares.com. No cats please!  We schedule meet and greets for approved adopters only, an application is the first step in our approval process. Thank you!\n\n",

He is looking for a\nhome that can be very patient with him as he needs time to open up and trust people. He is still pretty confused and nervous in general with all the changes happening in his life, but is starting to pick up on daily routines, learning to go to the bathroom outside etc. He is totally peaceful with  the other dog and cat in his foster home. Sudden moves and being touched still startles him, but he has started to solicit pets a little bit and follows his foster parents around. \n*\n I see a 75 lb dog who is even afraid of a little cat and i cant help but wonder what the hell his life was like prior to being dumped, but at the end of the day where he came from doesn\u2019t matter. What matters now is where he is going. We are so SO thankful to his fosters for taking a chance with him, being so patient and loving and sending consistent updates on his progress. If you are interested in meeting Yugo, please know that it will be a slow road with him, but he is the sweetest most loving pup once he opens up. He is great with other dogs once he is comfortable and has zero aggression towards cats.",

            "description": "Shane is beautiful, sweet and calm. He's great on a leash and is fond of treats, a fine motivator if he needs more training. Shane came into the shelter as a lost doggie with ID on Jan. 26 but his family could not be contacted. He is about 2 years old and weighs 60 pounds. He has not been neutered yet, but the vet will take care of that soon. He is up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested an microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 811 using ID#627042.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

Still, at almost ninety pounds, he can be quite strong on a leash, so he has been fitted for a harness. He loves to be with people and can be affectionate and loving. He also has fun with toys, (the big strong kind!). Rupert had to overcome neuter surgery, dewclaw removal, and a URI when he first came to the League but now he is raring to go! We are still learning about Rupert but if a big, and we mean BIG dog, is on your wish list, plan to visit with Rupert. He is just two years old and will need a family who will spend a good deal of time exercising and guiding him so that his size and energy does not become overbearing. To meet Rupert, call 513-735-2299 to schedule an appointment.",

I was originally found as a stray in Arkansas so we don't know anything about my history, how sad is that for a sweet little girl of my years?. Fortunately for me, I was eventually picked up, and then I made the long trip from Arkansas to Michigan! It's a good thing that I have an easy going personality and I'm actually looking forward to a new start with my life. Recently, I partook of a temperament test and although I didn't graduate at the top of my class, I wasn't at the bottom either. I passed my food and yummy treat test, my kissy-huggy test and my toy sharing test. I didn't rate so high on my dog interaction; especially with another female, so I would need to meet any new doggy companions before I move in. And as for cats; I wasn't able to introduce myself with any at this time. Also, it's been advised that I live with older children because I tend to jump up when I'm happy! I hope you can come meet me in person so I can share some of my loving with you. Please fill out an application and make an appointment today.",

Nala is still a puppy, so she's learning her manners and getting comfortable with the world. In typical puppy fashion, she can be timid with big loud noises she's never heard, but also rambunctious and playful. This lovable goof may do best in an experienced, adult-only home. She loved meeting all her doggy friends here, and may like a brother or sister to romp around with. She does best with large, playful dogs that can match her energy. Please bring the whole family (dogs too!) in to meet with this social butterfly today!",

She plays with the other dogs at her foster home, and will need a fenced yard to keep her scenting ability from leading her astray. Her foster mom reports that she is even a bit mischievous, stealing shoes and gloves when she is not looking! Missie is a bit thin right now, but will fill out in no time, and is ready to find her forever home. \nShe is spayed and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\nFor more information, please contact France at fbognon@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

            "description": "Teddy, is a 7 month old lab mix and is almost 50 lbs.  He's an absolute sweetie but is very timid and skittish.  The 1st time he meets someone he barks at them but you can see his whole body shaking.  Once he gets to know the person, he won't stop loving you.  He's his foster moms little shadow.\n\nGood with other dogs and wants to play.  Same with cats but can't figure out why they don't want to play.  Teddy likes kids but he's got energy and is a jumper so really small kids would need to be supervised around him.\n\nTeddy loves to go for walks. We've been going for 2 walks a day.  And he's learned very quickly how to walk nicely on a leash.  While he's got energy, he also enjoys laying at your feet in the evening.  Teddy really likes chew toys. A big chewer, we've gone through a number of toys but he never chews on anything but  chew toy.\n\nTeddy does great in his kennel.  Overnight he prefers being able to see you so we have his kennel in our bedroom and he does great.  He's had a few accidents but has been learning fast to go outside.\n\nTeddy is a wonderful snuggler and loves to give kisses.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Mocha and I am a 7-month-old retriever mix that weighs 41lbs. One of my favorite things to do is give kisses! I just love to get my energy out and play with the resident kids (ages 6 and 8).  They run around with me and throw the ball for me. I even like to get in on their dance parties.  I also really like to play with the resident dog. We play tug and wrestle.  The other elderly resident dog likes to be left alone so I do not bother him.  I know my foster mom likes to complain about all of the snow but I just LOVE it! I like to run in it, stick my face in it, and roll around in it. I know when we go outside it is time to go potty.  I have had a few accidents but I am doing better every day. Some things that scare me are when we go for car rides. I am also a little unsure of people I do not know.  I will bark at them to tell them to stay away but if they give me a treat, I will take it from them.  I don't always like to go into my kennel but after a few minutes, I am okay and lay down. I am young and still learning and if you want a snuggly sweet dog, I am your girl!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

It's impossible to believe that this 80-pound love bug was left behind by his previous owners when they moved. Fudge is a healthy, beautiful 5-year-old Lab mix who is well behaved and full of energy. He gets along with people and dogs, but hasn't had much experience around cats. Fudge needs space to run and play, and a home with a fenced-in yard is a must. He seems housebroken, and he's working on his leash manners. Fudge is neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, on flea and tick prevention, and is up to date on vaccinations. Available through Tired Dog Rescue, Gulfport, MS. Fee: $50. Apply at tireddogrescue.org",

She is (our best guesstimate) a Shep/Lab/Terrier mix, approx. 9 mos old, 40 lbs and she is a shy girl. She bonds pretty quickly, she just needs someone to give her the time to build that relationship. She is housetrained, walks great on a leash, good in the car, great with other dogs and cats. A quieter home would be best for her and a home in which there is another dog (she uses them as a comfort). Want to meet her? Adoption fee: $400. Fee includes her spay, current vaccinations, and microchip. For a profile with an adoption application, visit https://spotsavespets.org/dogs-n-puppies/ ..

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.UPDATE: Bruce got adopted and then was returned back to PRBJ. His owner was putting his snap on collar back on him and at that moment Bruce got out of her grasp and went after her dog and bit his ear and her adult daughter got nipped while trying to break them up. We feel maybe his hair got stuck in the clip and spooked him. The owner stated that the night before Bruce and her dog were fine together, no problems they played with no incident, Bruce was wonderful. Bruce has never shown any aggression at the rescue with staff or other dogs. Bruce is a 4 year old neutered male. He friendly with cats and dogs. He is a sweet cuddle bug. He absolutely loves the outdoors and loves nature trails. He can run forever if you let him. When he is indoors he is a couch potato. He is potty trained, crate trained (command word is 'house:). He will pull you when he sees squirrels/lizards when on a leash. He loves to give you kisses. He has been around kids 2 and up and has done amazing around them. Bruce even went to an event where there was tons of people of all ages with loud music playing and did amazing at the event. He listens to positive praise and he does aim to please. He is a very loving dog who just needs a great home with someone who can give him the attention he deserves. Please let's help this sweet dog get the forever home he has been waiting for.\nHis owner had to give him up because he moved back home and parent did not want the dog in home.",

Chihuahua and dachshund mix.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.

I am so handsome and unique, I know I turn heads everywhere I go!\nI am a good-natured boy who just wants to make friends and play! So far, My foster family of small dogs works for me- I take their cues to go away when they tell me to. Kitties are possible IF you work on his training! I am very quiet in the car, and sit for my treats like a good boy. And I LOVE to play fetch! Come meet me to see how special I am! My adoption fee is $250 Put in an application at www.eapl.com\n\nTEMP TEST:\nhttps://youtu.be/Dl-RXF9irmQ\n\nFOOD TEST:\nhttps://youtu.be/kCxRa9dCTuY",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nEcho is a gorgeous 2 year-old Aussie mix with a bobtail who came to us from a rural county dog shelter after having been shot multiple times both in the face and torso. This sweet dog has no doubt had an awful time of it recently at the hands of a horrible person or people but he is now on the mend and ready to make a fresh start in a brand new home. All things considered, Echo was very lucky that the gunshot damage wasn't more serious. The bullet fragments that hit him in the face fractured some teeth that had to be removed while those that entered his shoulder and hip areas didn't hit any vital organs fortunately. Those wounds are now healing nicely. Echo still has some bullet fragments in his body but those are best left alone as it can produce more harm than good to try to remove them. Although he's understandably still a little ouchy, Echo is a very happy, friendly dog who gets along well with other dogs and has done well meeting new people too. He would do best in a mature home without young kids and would enjoy having a canine buddy. Echo would also enjoy having a yard with an aboveground fence to allow him to play safely. He has done well with his crate training in his foster home so should be able to master the house rules without too much trouble in his new home. He will eagerly sit for a treat and may know other commands that we haven't discovered yet. Echo enjoys going for a walk and would make an excellent trail buddy for an active person once his wounds are completely healed. We can't wait to see this wonderful dog living his best life with his new person or family. There are no cats in Echo's foster home so we don't know how he would be living with them. Echo weighs about 40 pounds and his adoption fee is $350. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Echo. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Echo and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

I am laidback and am looking for a quieter home! I am a good boy on the leash and could do well in an apartment! I am a smart boy and have mastered house training but I\u2019m still working on crate training. My love for you could set the world on fire! Fill out an application today! \n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is sponsored and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.

            "description": "Hi my name is Milan and I am female terrier mix found with Vienna running around and neither of us was reported missing so here we are looking for homes. I am only about 9 months old and I weigh 16lbs. I am a typical puppy full of energy and wanting to play and wrestle all the time. I am athletic and can jump and negotiate lots of obstacles, so I will need a secure yard and/or someone who will want to walk and play with me and use up some of my puppy energy! I love to paly and interact with other dogs so a playmate sibling would be a great benefit to me. I am crate trained, but to be honest, I am not a fan and will entertain myself by rearranging everything in the crate and tearing it up !! yes, I am all puppy and will need guidance, training, patience and lots of love to become the best dog ever and your best pal.  If you would like to adopt me, please put in an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org that is the ONLY way to adopt from this rescue. You can also donate there to help keep this rescue open as they may have to close, which would be so sad for dogs like me in need of rescue and a helping hand. \nLove, \nMilan xo",

She definitely needs a fenced in yard to work off her energy and will be fine if there is a male for her to play with but Molli can be rough at times.    Just needs someone to oversee the play time and let her know what is or isn't allowed.   Crating is out of the question for this girl.   She definitely does not like one.     Looking for someone who will be patient and take the time to get her thru a few obstacles.    She can be anxious in the car but over time that can be corrected.    Also, she can be leash reactive but with training, that too can be work with.   We don't know how she is with cats, so it be best that there aren't any.    As for children, no young ones.   Teenagers would be fine.   This girl is sweet as can be and once she adjusts into her new home, will be the love bug you expect her to be.   If interested, go to www.dvdpa.org and then to adopt to fill out the on-line application.",

You see, Eldora did not have it easy when she was born. She was found on the Pine Ridge Reservation with seven other puppies - all of them struggling to find food, water and warmth. Despite it all, she is so sweet and a joy to foster! Eldora is being fostered with Breckenridge, Revelstoke and Lutsen.\n\nBecause of this, Eldora does require a special adopter! She needs a family that can be patient as she slowly comes out of her shell, one that can teach her manners and properly socialize her with other animals and people and one that is committed to handling an energetic, big puppy!\n\nEldora does require a yard with a fence. Everything is brand new to her and she can be easily scared. She will also require a harness and leash attached to her at all times until she is comfortable in her new home - inside and even outside in the fenced yard.\n\nEldora would also do best in a home with no kids or older kids only. The toddler in her foster home scares her with all of his toddler noises but she does do will with the foster's older (10yr+) children. Eldora is mouthy! She was never taught that bones are for chewing - not people! Most kids will not like this - and something her forever family will need to work on.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

At only 2 years old and 30 lbs she was dumped full of milk and the owners refused to turn in her 5 week old pups with her.  I was sickened by this story and needed to help.   She is now on medications to dry up her milk and in rehab with one of our trainers to help her with her anxiety in looking for her puppies.  Right now she just wants to be with her people but is doing well in playgroups with other dogs as well.  We will update more as we know it.    Adoption fee 150.00",

And when the day is done, you can count on lots of snuggles from this sweet guy. He has a beautiful, shiny silver/grey coat, with markings of reddish gold. And that face - oh so handsome!\n\nSweet Brody was on Death Row in a high kill facility in Georgia, and we were able to rescue him in the nick of time.\n\nBrody is 1 year old, weighs 48 lbs, has all of his required vaccines, and is neutered and microchipped.\n\nDid we mention he has the SWEETEST temperament??? He loves other dogs, and he's happy to spend time with humans of all ages.  Because of his activity level, we believe he'd do best in a home with older children or no children.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this delightful young boy, please complete an adoption application at https://www.heartsandtails.org/adoption-application/.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that due to the overwhelming number of inquiries we receive daily, we can only respond to those who have completed an online application, and appear to be a good match.

RAWL does not transport dogs. All potential adopters need to meet prospective dogs.\n\nWith all that said on to Duchess's Bio\n\n\"Duch\" came from a loving home and a wonderful owner who could no longer keep her. Her former owner asked that Duchess be placed in a home with no small children and a fenced yard. Duchess is super friendly, social and even goofy.  She has been good with other dogs she has met, and friendly with the RAWL office cat. However, when our office cat runs Duchess is happy to chase. So a cat that is dog savvy would probably be ideal.  Duchess is having some of her vetting updated on 2/2 and would not be available until after 2/3\n",

She loves to play and chase other dogs.\nSkye MUST have another big dog in the home because she has anxiety when left alone. She is crate trained but not long periods please. She needs someone who works from home or a stay at home person. \n    Must have large yard or fenced acreage. Therefore no apartments.\n  At her foster home there are grandkids 6 years and up. She is rambunctious so probably no super young kids. She has lived with cats.\n  She is really strong on a leash. Could still use some leash training. \n Skye loves to love and get attention. \nIf you would like to meet Skye please fill out an application to start the process.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting/adopting Skye, please complete an online application at our website, secondchancedogs.net.\n\nThe adoption donation is $350.00, of which a portion is tax deductible. All donations are funneled back into the rescue for care of the animals we take in.",

I came to this rescue as an unclaimed stray from a local shelter. I am a very sweet and friendly and athletic medium sized girl. Extremely attentive to people and very gentle when approached. I am a very good jumper, and have great agility! I will need a fenced yard or someone willing to give me long walks to explore and sniff like Beagles like to do! I am good with most dogs but can be a bit picky at times. Nor great with cats as I like to chase them. I am crate trained and working on my house manners. I am happy to be here as it looks like without support I may one of the last to come to this rescue. If you would like to adopt me, please fill out an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org That is the only way to be considered to adopt and you can also donate there to help save this rescue. \nlove, \nVienna xo",

            "description": "This is Athena. She is a female German Shepard mix about 18 mos to 2 yrs. She is currently in foster care in Olympia, Washington. Looking for her forever home. Please apply if interested. Thank you!\n\nThis is a posting for L & S Dog Diggity Rescue. You can fill out and application below. Yes you must COPY and PASTE this application link.\n\nhttps://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-ls-dog-diggity/\n\nAll adopted pups and dogs are transported by our transport unit to WA/OR families when fully vetted, spayed/neutered and microchipped. For information on how to adopt me, please contact my foster parents at info@dogdiggityrescue.com. L&S Dog Diggity Rescue is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, where there are over 350,000 homeless pets. We save homeless and abandoned dogs and find them loving forever homes in other areas, where pet homelessness is not epidemic. All of our pets are located here, in San Antonio, and we partner with rescues to provide transportation for our pets to their new homes. Our adoption fee includes vet care (vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchipping, etc), as well as transportation and health certificate. Please contact us to ask about our adoption process and our adoption fees. You can contact us directly at info@dogdiggityrescue.com, or fill out an application at https://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-ls-dog-diggity/\n\nImportant: If you are interested in this pup/dog, please fill out the application (link listed above). The rescue will contact you once the application is received. Although we strive to answer everyone, due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we cannot guarantee a response to all emails. Filling out the application is the ONLY way and ensures a response from the rescue. In addition, while you are emailing us, if others apply, you lose out adopting the dog you chose. We have hundreds and hundreds of puppies/dogs available so there really is no need to apply anywhere else. However, if you are applying or have applied anywhere else, we do need to know that.\n\nSHANYE'S FOSTERS is a group of foster parents in the Olympia/Tumwater area. We foster dogs for rescues and assist them in adopting/rehoming of their pups/dogs by listing on this site. Many dogs posted here are available to pre adopt NOW directly from the rescue. The only ones in foster in the NW specifically state that. We have very few fosters so most need to be pre adopted. All adoption fees go towards rescuing more dogs in need. No one receives a salary. Shayne's Fosters is not responsible for any experience you have with any dog you might see posted on this site. They are the property of the sponsoring rescue who will supply all medical supporting records which is given with each dog when adopted.\n\nOur adoption fees cover all medical costs to make sure the pups are appropriately vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and spayed/ neutered. It also covers the cost of transportation from Texas and the necessary health certificate documentation. The fees also include a negative heart-worm test for any dogs over 6 months. Some dogs/pups have additional medical, including but not limited to FHO, ACL, hernias, dental, and a myriad of other vetting. If the adoption fees seem high (which never cover the true cost of rescue), we recommend fostering for a good rescue. Fostering ensures you incur no vet bills and no boarding fees. We are always in need of good fosters. We are all volunteers who donate our time and resources to help save as many dogs/pups as we possibly can.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt a rescue pup/dog. Worldwide over 1/2 or 1 billion puppies/dogs are PTS yearly. thousands and thousand daily (yes entire litters, pregnant/nursing moms are PTS daily just in U.S. shelters. Yes even entire litters of puppies yes DAILY in many US shelters! We firmly believe there is NO breed other than rescue for all species. Thank you for being part of the village it takes to save these precious lives.",

She is super affectionate and was living with other dogs and is in a foster home with another female pei.\n\nRihanna rides well in a car, knows how to use a dog door and is potty trained, isn't a fan of crates, and does fine with both baths and nail clipping....easy all the way around. She loves to lounge around with you, but is also great on walks. She does appear to have some selective hearing...could be a shar lei thing or could be hearing loss due to age. and did we mention she loves treats and food?\n\nIf you are looking for a sweet, well mannered, well taken care of pei, Rihanna is your dream girl. She is up to date on vaccines, is microchipping and is currently waiting for her forever home. She is currently fostering in the Los Angeles area.\n\nto learn more, visit www.PeiPeople.com",

She has a soft plush thick coat and is about 10lbs, and previously spayed.  \n\nShe was surrendered to the local pound when her owner passed and the relative caring for her had to move... she was said to be 5 years old but looks more like at least twice that and is definitely an older lady.  She\u2019s been ok with calm dogs but really craves human attention.  We are still getting to know her and she will get a medical work up and much needed dental very soon but email njwoof@cs.com \nif you think you would be interested in meeting her once she\u2019s ready... \n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

We update our website daily just so you will know the status right away).  PLEASE GO TO OUR WEBSITE for up to date information to find out.  Check the Gallery by putting your mouse on the photo. \nIF it says Pending, we chose someone, but they haven't met up yet.  If it says Adopted, then the dog has been happily united with a forever family.\n\nIF nothing is there other than their name, they are still available.\n\nAPPLY if interested so you can be considered.\n\n*Our page is updated daily. Please go to www.wowdogrescue.org for any updates.\n\nPenelope is approx. 4 lb.  Most likely a Jack Russel/Chi/ and Maltese mix puppy.\n(Basing this on what the other pups look like).  She was found in a box in an alley with 3 other puppies.  The lady that found them went door to door asking if they knew who these pups belonged too...but no one seemed to know. One neighbor wanted 1 of them and the 3 came to our rescue.  They are now 13 weeks old and are being vetted and spay/neutered.  Penelope is scheduled for Feb 16th to be spay.\n\nPenelope has been with the foster for a few weeks with out any play mates, but she was great with her siblings when they were all together.  She is good with kids as she likes to play.\n\n1st intro to people is she is shy, but then super sweet. She is getting used to loud noises but she is getting braver each time. Penelope likes to be in her crate at night because she feels safe there.   She will let her foster parents know when she has to go potty by going to the door.  She has only had 2 potty accidents in the home, so shes doing great with that! She is learning to walk on a leash.  She loves snuggling and falling asleep  on any one that will hold her.  She loves playing tug all day with her foster mom.  She rides well in the car, and normally falls to to sleep right away.  She has a kong toy that she loves filled with peanut butter, and it keeps her busy. Penelope's Foster says shes a very good listener\nand learns quickly with treats.  She is very energetic, cheerful and sweet and the foster says she would make the new family proud if they rescued her!\n\nPenelope will be spay, puppy shot series, Bordetella and Microchipped by 2/16/21  Penelope's adoption fee is set at $275.00\n\nWE ARE NOT PETFINDER.
