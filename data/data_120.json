I am an affectionate and loving dog who's looking for a forever home. My favorite pastimes include getting some sun in the backyard, playing with my dog friends, patrolling the fence, and getting a nice belly scratch. I have had some bad experiences in the past so I prefer to be around women, but I do get along nicely with other dogs. Other than that, I'm a great companion and an overall wonderful pup!\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

I love to go fun places and see new things.  I am well socialized and always enjoy a new adventure.  I also like to just curl up on the couch, eat popcorn and watch TV.  \n\nThe nice ladies at Ahimsa Rescue where I am staying tell me that I am quite a handsome one and start singing hunk-a-hunk of burning love and something about Elvis Presley....whatever that means.  Anyway, I always try to be a good dog, and I promise I would try extra hard if you would give me a chance.  \n\nIf you need a good dog like me please come see me soon.\n\nLove,\nTrevor\n\napprox. DOB: January 2016\n\nIMPORTANT:  If you are interested in adopting a pet from Ahimsa Rescue, an on-line adoption form is required. Ahimsa's pets live at private homes in foster care.   Once an application is received an approved a convenient time is set to meet and adopt the pet.  Please complete the on line adoption application at:  www.ahimsarescuefoundation.org to begin the adoption process. \n \nAhimsa Rescue Foundation is an all volunteer, foster-based rescue in Muldrow, OK. Our pets will be fully vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and microchipped before the adoption becomes final. Adult dogs are heart worm negative and on preventative.  To start the process please visit our website and fill out the adoption application at www.ahimsarescuefoundation.org",

Della has been through a lot in her 2 years, she was seized by the police from outdoor living conditions where she was starving. She also suffers from intense fear of almost everything including humans. She is submissive to the extreme and we hope with time she might recover enough to be adoptable. She is receiving medical treatment from a team of wonderful veterinarians including a behavior specialist and is on a long-term medical hold.  Please consider helping sponsor Della\u2019s medical care.\n\nI am a purebred English Mastiff that was lucky enough to be taken in by the folks at Great Lakes Mastiff Rescue, Inc.  I need a loving, forever home.  If you can give me that home, please visit www.glmr.org to complete an adoption application and a volunteer will contact you soon. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:  GLMR ONLY ADOPTS TO THE GREAT LAKES STATES (MI, OH, IN, IL, WI). PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS WILL NOT BE RETURNED UNLESS YOU HAVE FILLED OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION FIRST. A GLMR REPRESENTATIVE WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN 2 WEEKS AFTER FILLING OUT A FAMILY PROFILE.\n\nIf you are not able to adopt, please consider making a donation to GLMR to help with medical bills for one of these gentle giants. Giant breed dogs also come with giant vet bills. All GLMR dogs are fixed, up to date on shots and healthy when they go to their new homes, but they don't always come to us that way. GLMR does not turn away dogs for health problems! So please help us to help them and make a tax deductible donation to GLMR by clicking the SPONSOR ME button above. Thank you in advance!",

            "description": "Meet Simba, named after the character in the Disney movie The Lion King.  Simba means powerful warrior, and his name certainly suits him.  Simba was pulled from a high kill shelter in North Carolina on his very last day.  Simba came to us emaciated and covered with horrible scars and bite wounds.  Everywhere on his poor, frail body had either scabs, open wounds or scars.  We estimate Simba to be around five years old and he is a bully breed mix.  He is a big eater, but does not show any food aggression or guarding at all, which is amazing considering he was nearly starved to death.  Simba would benefit from some training, as he was never taught leash manners.  Simba has a wonderful personality - he is very energetic and LOVES toys.  He loves to carry his blanket around and play with it.  He will play with basically anything he can find.  Simba loves people and will sit still and soak up all the love and attention you are willing to give him.  Simba is wonderful with people and children and does well with cats, but he needs to be the only dog.  We can only imagine what horrors he endured before he came into our rescue and sadly those encounters caused him to not get along with other dogs.  We don't blame Simba one bit and we totally understand - now we are hoping to find a wonderful adopter who also understands and wants to give Simba the loving home that he so deserves.  We promise that Simba will more than make up for that one short-coming with endless amounts of love, loyalty and companionship.\n\nSimba is house and crate-trained, up to date on all shots, heartworm negative and on heartworm, flea and tick prevention.  Simba clearly had a really rough past and although his body will always bear plenty of scars, he did not let his past form his personality.  \"Scars remind us of where we have been, but they do not have to dictate where we are going.\u201d  And this is certainly true for Simba.  Please consider opening your heart and home to this sweet boy and finding out for yourself what an amazing boy he is \u2013 you won\u2019t regret it!",

            "description": "3.5yr old. American Bully/American Staffordshire Terrier mix. Friendly girl to those she knows. Enjoys playing and loves the outdoors. Rambunctious at times so she needs a fenced yard for play time. Loyal to her owner(s). Protective of her home. Best as an only dog but does ok with other dogs her size. She is still young so some training would be a big plus and is recommended. Seems fine around younger kids (she used to live with one) but hasn't had much contact with them in a while. She is manageable around cats...but would do best in a home without them.  Her new home should be 1 or 2 adults. Maybe 1 dog (but not necessary, and a fenced yard). Her adopter should make sure that her breed is accepted where she will live and will continue to have her should a move happen. Training (obedience and/or behavioral) is something that we recommend setting up or continuing (if she has already started sessions).\nAvailable to a good experienced home, only! DOB 12/15/16 \n\nFee is $75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD INFO:\n\n11mo. old American Bully. Parents are registered champions. Friendly girl but very rambunctious. Fine with kids (older are best). Fine with other dogs but would probably do best as the only dog since she doesn't always like sharing her food, treats,  and toys.\nShe did not come from the best situation and home so she needs some love and basic training. An owner experienced in bully breeds is best!\n\n\nFee is $125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD INFO:\n\nThis puppy is an AMERICAN BULLY (a recently formed companion breed dog). 8 weeks old. Owner surrender. Parents of the pup are champion registered and blue bloods (not sure what that means exactly) and are beautiful. This pup and sibling are looking for homes...permanent homes (does not have to go together). Must be experienced with bully breeds and preferably own your own home w/a fenced yard (due to the rising problem with bully breeds being allowed in certain apartments, etc.). Be sure to check with your HOA.\nWill be a beautiful strong puppy that will be a great family dog, also.\n(PICTURES COMING SOON!)\n\n\nFee is 300 (includes shots, spay when cleared by vet, and microchip)\n\n\nInfo On The Breed:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bully\n\nhttp://www.dogbreedinfo.com/a/americanbully.htm",

Nevada Petco, University Village, from 10 AM to 4 PM, on any Saturday.\n\nAbout 2 years old.  \n\nShe will need lots of hugs and patience.\n\nIf you see her at Petco, she will not walk but flattens like a pancake because she is afraid.

He loves to go on walks, to cuddly, to sleep in the bed with his people, car rides, etc. \n\nHe needs a calm environment with not too many strangers coming in and out since he gets a little protective over his \"owners\". \n\nOverall he's a really good and smart dog who loves to learn and spend time with people, He's very athletic, so a backyard would be good for him to have.\n\nPlease call 917-515-6335 for any questions about Lucky Jake or email fabi@agwc501.org.",

His last owner allowed rescue to secure him and surrendered to rescue so he could find a better home.\n\nWHERE IS THIS DOG NOW ?- He is now in foster care in Goderich. He lives with adults and is used to living with other dogs.\n\n**ALL ABOUT TUCKER  \nTucker is fully vetted\nHe is a wonderful passenger in the vehicle (albeit scared to get in initially) and a fantastic dog in general.\nHe was guessed to be about 6-7 yrs old on intake so could be 9-10 now as he arrive January 2017.\n\nTucker had  1 lump removed off muzzle with chemotherapy in June and 4 lump removed in July 2020 and they are all benign.",

Muttsy is a super loving and loyal doggie that immediately captures the hearts of everyone who spends time with him! He is such a mush, he LOVES to get loved on and will lean into you while adoringly gazing up into your eyes. \n\nHe is a wonderful combination of sweet and cuddly, chill out on the couch on a rainy day and active and ready for a 4 mile hike at any given moment! He is a bit insecure without the security of a happy leader.. this does not mean a bossy tough person.. no no! This means a confident happy I got it covered Dude you can count on me type of leader!  \n\nSince he has been with us, Muttsy has learned a lot of obedience and has awesome manners!! He is GREAT on the leash, polite and responsive and never pulls. He is quite smart, picks up on new things quickly...  he's always eager to learn new stuff and loves to be close to his humans. Muttsy will sit automatically on the leash when you stop, he knows lots of commands like sit, stay, look, down, heel!\n\nEmail us with questions and Please contact us directly if you have questions or are interested in adopting by emailing us at lovedogs.bedfordny@gmail.com and visit fortheloveofdogsrescue.org",

We know that it would be too stressful for Peppy to transition to a new home at this point. His foster parents donate their time to caring for Peppy, but caring for him requires more than love. Our rescue provides nutritious food, medications and vital veterinary care.\n\nAdopt A Dog/Save A Life relies on the generosity of donors to cover the cost of medication and procedures required to keep dogs like Peppy comfortable during their remaining days. If you would like make a donation in support of Peppy's care, please let us know!\n\nPeppy is one of the sweetest dogs you will ever meet! He is 12 years old and weighs approximately 12 pounds. He originally came to us with another little Pomeranian. He and Layla were very bonded. Layla also had very serious health issues and she recently passed away due to her heart condition. We did all we could to keep her comfortable until her passing. They were both surrendered to us because their owner was moving and not able to take them along or care for them properly. They did get adopted but were returned. As mentioned, both Layla and Peppy had several health issues when we first rescued them. Thanks to the support of our donors we were able to get them the medical care they required and we are now able to keep Peppy comfortable and happy in his forever foster home.",

            "description": "PLEASE READ: Thank you for your interest in one of our adoptable dogs!  All dogs listed are still available.  If interested, please complete our no obligation application.  This can be found at www.waldosmuttleycrew.org.  Select the Applications tab, then Adoption Application. THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS.  It can take up to a week to process an application.  We are an all-volunteer rescue so please be patient.\n\nOur adoption area is limited to a 4 hour radius of Indianapolis.  We try our best to provide all information in our bios.  If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask during the interview process.  Some of our dogs have special requirements such as needs another dog in the home or requires a physical and permanent fenced yard.  These requirements are not negotiable.  Unless otherwise noted, we do not cat test our adoptable dogs.  We also require that all pets in your household be spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and on a monthly heartworm/flea preventative. \n\nE-MAILS: We do not respond to e-mail inquiries without an application.  We regret that we cannot respond to every e-mail unless you fill out an application.  \n\nAll the dogs we offer for adoption have been spayed/neutered, wormed and microchipped, are up-to-date on immunizations, have been tested for heartworm and are currently receiving a monthly preventative.  If the dog had additional medical issues, those have also been addressed.  Visit our website www.waldosmuttleycrew.org for more information and to complete an application.\n\nFallon is a gorgeous 4 year old Great Pyrenees/husky mix who weighs a \nlean 65-70 lbs.  She's lithe & athletic and simply beautiful!  We are \nvery proud of her as when we got her, Fallon was terrified of all men \nand anxious with strangers; she's come from a very abusive home.  With \ntime & gentleness, she has learned that people aren't going to hurt her \nanymore.  Given a few minutes to warm up and a treat or two, Fallon \nleans into people for ear scratches, her tail waving gently as she \nenjoys the attention.  She's very gentle when getting pet and takes \ntreats so softly.  Fallon is so loyal to the people she knows; her \ndevotion is amazing.  Because she's an active girl who's favorite \nactivities involve high speed chases & games of tug of war, Fallon needs \nto go to a home with a large, playful dog who also enjoys these \nactivities.  We can't imagine her without a doggy companion; she just \nwouldn't be complete.  Fallon is good with most other dogs but she's \ndrawn to large males ... with her looks, they do seem to find her \nirresistible as well.  She will need a physical fence in her new home so \nthat she has room to run & play.  Fallon's adoption fee is $175; she's \nspayed, microchipped and current on vaccinations as well monthly \nheartworm/flea preventative.\n",

            "description": "April\u2019s journey with Adopt-A-Dog began in October of 2015. She came from the Ross County Humane Society in Ohio, and as she settled in we saw how fearful April was and that she would need a lot of confidence-building in order to make her more comfortable in both a home and the outside world. Despite that, we were able to get April adopted within the month, with her family immediately beginning training with us we thought April landed in the right home. After a few months, the family contacted us and decided April was not the right fit for them. During her first couple of weeks back with us, we noticed some behavioral changes in April, including a more reserved and uneasy nature when it came to meeting strangers. Our main goal was to build her trust and confidence around people and once over that hurdle, we realized how desperately this gorgeous girl wanted to please her people. \n\nComing back into our shelter was not the ideal environment for April\u2019s health, so we knew right away that we had to get her a friend. We matched her with Sora and now the best part of April\u2019s day is getting out in the yard with her best friend. This confidence boost of being around another dog led April to be placed in foster with one of our staff members. In that home, she was with three other dogs and we were able to really understand her hesitation with people. As her fosters gained her trust, April built more confidence knowing that they would not hurt her.  \n\nFor April\u2019s adoption, her new family would have to meet her several times and come to learn the excellent training she has learned here at Adopt-A-Dog. Along with her fear-based behavior, April does resource guard from other dogs and humans. Our trainer and Behavior Coordinator would equip any family with the training they need and we would follow up with training after adoption to ensure April and her new family\u2019s success.\n\n An ideal home for April would be one with owners who understand and have experience with fearful dogs and can help build a trusting and lasting relationship with her. We know that this home is out there and April cannot wait to find it!\n\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7",

The ironic thing about this particular frowning dog is that she will keep a constant smile on your face with her adorable antics and loving personality! She is housebroken and crate trained. And she loves to play soccer with you! She is a great dog to practice soccer with but she wants a worthy opponent. She prefers her opponents to be 12 and up. She loves playing fetch with tennis balls, and she LOVES water. In fact, the staff calls her their little Hippo because you can't keep her out of the water or puddles. She would love to have a swimming pool or even a kiddie pool in the backyard\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

I love playing tug, fetch, and hanging out with my doggie and human housemates. I enjoy walks, but really just want to be with you! I am fast learner and will do almost anything for a treat. I know how to sit and lay down and will roll over for a belly rub. I don\u2019t like loud voices or noises and I cannot be in a house with cats. I am spayed and up-to-date on my shots. My favorite way to pass the time is playing with all of my toys while snuggling up next to anyone who will rub my tummy. I hope to meet you soon!\nAdoption fee is for fully vetted pet or a voucher to have this pet fully vetted.\n\nIf interested in this pet please email us at westsideanimals@gmail.com",

            "description": "TRUE BEAGLE LOVER NEEDED! \n\nSnap was surrendered to us by his owner, and has been with us for TOO LONG! \nSnap is now 5 years old, is adorable, active, playful, social, good with other dogs, and just wants someone to love him. \n\nSnap does have separation anxiety, which is well controlled with medication (which will need to be maintained post-adoption). This sounds weird, but he seriously needs a home with a window he can look out during the day...it seems to help his separation anxiety if he can do so. Adopters experienced with separation anxiety are preferred since it will likely temporarily worsen when he is placed in a new home.  Someone who works part-time or does not have a standard \"9-5 + commute\" type of time away from the home would be best, and he needs another friendly dog in the home for sure. \n\nSnap is a typical high energy young beagle, and will bolt out doors, so a fenced in yard is recommended. He loves other dogs, but has times of chasing the cats so we do not recommend a home with cats. Snap CANNOT be crated, so this cannot be a consideration for him. He is housetrained. Any accidents that occur are related to anxiety or being left for too long. Snap loves to snuggle, and gets very attached to people very quickly. Someone willing to take him for walks and give him adequate exercise would be awesome. We are recommending against children in the home given that Snap is very excitable, howls loudly when excited, and will likely jump up on and scare young children. (The howling would likely rule out apartment dwellers and/or those concerned with noise issues.) Snap does have a bite history due to 2 occurrences (over 8 months) towards the same person in one of our foster homes. No incidents have occurred in other environments, but Snap can be \"mouthy\" when excited and when playing which is also why we will not consider an adoptive home for him with children in it.  \n\nSnap is incredibly responsive to positive reinforcement training. Someone willing to continue his training, and even pursue additional training would be his ideal adopter! We can and will share additional information about Snap through our adoption process, so if interested, please review our adoption process, requirements and submit an application here: www.beaglerescueleague.org/adoption",

We think he's part retriever because he loves to retrieve tennis balls so much!                            Cross was actually obtained on Craigslist then abandoned at a local boarding kennel. He lived at the kennel for several years until finally finding a foster home. He\u2019s very affectionate after he gets to know you. He hasn\u2019t been around many people but once he\u2019s comfortable with you, he\u2019s so loving and will follow you and hug on you!\nCross likes playing with other dogs and would do best having another dog in his home who he can learn from. He prefers sweet, playful female dogs most.\nCross also needs a fenced yard to run and play safely in. He weighs around 55 lbs, is vaccinated, neutered and also microchipped. He's never been around children, so no kids under 12 please.\n",

Addie brings so much goofy, happy energy to everyone she meets.\n\nShe LOVES playing in the water sprinkler and on hot days will take a dip in the baby pool. She loves to play with her toys, go for walks, car rides and will sit in your lap to be petted if you let her.\n\nAddie needs a fenced yard with a tall privacy fence.\n\nShe has not lived with children so no kids under 12 please.\n\nShe\u2019s used to being the only pet in the home and is not used to dog parks. She\u2018ll do best as the only pet OR with a sweet, non-dominant male dog who will play but isn\u2019t too hyper.\n",

Tyler needs a tall wood privacy fence, no short chain link fences 4 ft tall. No children in the home, if kids visit, it must not be often as Tyler is not used to kids and was previously abused and has trust issues. \n\nTyler is a beautiful dog, but PLEASE don\u2019t inquire because he\u2019s handsome. He needs a person with extensive dog experience, someone who\u2019s raised multiple dogs over the years please. Tyler does best with women and has only lived with women. He\u2019s met 2 men ever that he trusted. He will not be adopted to a home with men alone, there needs to be a woman in his home.\nTyler is a darling boy but a very special dog with specific needs. \n\nPlease read below and only inquire if you meet his requirements below and are serious about helping a dog with special needs and behavior issues.\n\nTyler is a 6 year old, male,  Terrier/Poodle mix, and weighs around 30 lbs. He's a gorgeous boy and is very loving once he gets to know and trust you. Tyler needs extra time to get used to new people and will do best after a few introductions. He was very scared when we first got him and he didn't trust anyone. A trainer said he was previously abused which makes sense why it takes time for him to become comfortable with new people.\n\nHe loves our volunteers, who he knows and trusts. He needs a calm, loving person and home, and someone with a lot of dog experience. He doesn't like strangers coming up to him until he gets to know them well. He must have the right adopter and right home for this to work out. He will do best in a very calm, quiet home with someone who will be patient until he comes out of his shell. An apartment will not work. Not a home with much company or out of town visitors either. Preferably a one or two person home with no children or grandchildren. Tyler is not good with small kids at all.\n\nIf someone will give him a chance, they will be very happy they did. He\u2019s one of the most loving dogs ever and even likes to give hugs around your neck!\nTyler loves to play with toys and to go for walks and especially likes to hang out on the sofa. He rides great in the car also. He must be the only pet in the home. Other animals who get too close really seems to bother him. He has never been around children and given that he's nervous with new people at first, kids will not be suitable for him. The most important thing is a calm, quiet home with one or two people, preferably someone a little older and more settled. Young adults, out of college, engaged or who will have children in the future won't be the right match for Tyler. He\u2019s still very active so we\u2019d like someone in the 40-60 year old age range.\n\nIn order for Tyler to get used to someone new, it will take several introductions. \nWe've had dogs like Tyler in the past and when we take things slow, they work out beautifully for the dog and for the adopter.\n\nOnly local adopters/Metro Atlanta only - No Exceptions",

Her original owner kept her in a pen outside with no attention. She now lives as in indoor dog in her foster home and loves life! She only weighs 45 lbs and really is the perfect size. She loves to go for walks and is very easy to please, and most of all loves her toys! Sugar Bear has never lived with small kids, so kids 12 and older is best if kids are in the home. She gets along best with sweet, calm male dogs but she would love being the only pet where she can get all the attention! Ready for a sweet baby? If so, she is your girl!

He is slower to warm up to males and would do best in a home with older children only and where he can be the only pet. At his previous house the neighborhood kids taunted and abused him in the yard where he was left- he is a bit untrusting of children now. He was born in February of 2015. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heartworm preventative, heartworm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

Oak's likes to have his own sleeping space and has a protective nature as well as some reactivity toward forward pets from people he doesn't know well. We believe a home with young children would likely have too many new visitors and might receive more focused attention ( and perhaps more uneducated, grabby attention than he'd be comfortable with. Oakley is an smart, active, responsive dog. He requires a knowledgeable leader. \n\nHe loves to play fetch, surrenders the ball easily for another toss.. He does play ball on his own also! He will toss the ball and chase it catch it and repeat.. !!! He is a lot of fun!  Oakley can chill out and enjoy a good lounge but he craves daily activity.. body mind and heart!\n\n***While we are very grateful for PetFinder, we have been having chronic problems receiving inquires.

After people fed them for 3 weeks, they were finally able to catch them. Zelma is still a little shy. She needs someone to show her that people can be trusted. Not everyone is going to love and leave her!\n\n Zelma weighs 9 lbs\n\nUPDATE January 29, 2020\nWe THINK she is between 7- 9 years old\n\nFebruary 12, 2018. Kids love Zelma and Zelma loves kids!

I  have a \"groucho marx\" eyebrow that makes me all the more endearing. I'm sweet and friendly but am wary of strangers and am very selective with dogs.  I am not good with cats and since I'm a bit of a bruiser, it's best if I go with kids ages 10Yrs +. I would love a home in the country with a fenced in yard and need someone who knows, loves and appreciates my breed. I'm medium energy and love to play fetch but I should be an ONLY DOG so I can hog all the attention.I am a super wonderful boy that will be your BFF forever. Come meet/adopt me today!\n\nFor more info/app, pls email: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

We think he resembles a Treeing Walker Coonhound but we really do not know what his mix is other than a hound dog. He and his companion appeared to act like house dogs so we are listing him as housetrained, however, we do not have him in a home where this can be evaluated. We think he is around 8 years old so middle aged but not quite a senior yet. Very sweet disposition. He seems to like other dogs but he will crawl onto their backs to play etc so needs to be a dog that is close to the same size as him and easy going. He has been neutered, dewormed, and vacs. His adoption is $125 to help offset cost of medical. Email pbroklahoma.com for an application for this big boy!",

She is loving. She loves her toys.  Great on walks.  Chloe walks fast. She is 35#.\nChloe is special needs.  After a procedure, she developed 2 strictures in her esphosogus.  We had a specials (2) work on ballooning the strictures to open them up.  After many tries, a large balloon was used but caused a small tear since that has healed.  So she will be a special needs dog which requires feeding her wet food mixed with water 3 times a day thru a tube (in her side - not painful) because she cannot swallow even a tiny piece of food.  If she does, it gets stuck and she regurgitates/coughs it up. So anyone who cares to adopt a special needs must always be careful about food.\nShe is energized, and loves her walks on the beach or anywhere.  She is good with the blond chow and the shep/lab we are also fostering. CONTACT adoptachowla@gmail.com \n\nContact  adoptachowla@gmail.com",

We do need the entire party to be involved when meeting available dogs, including every family member and dog(s) that currently live in your home.  \n\nThis handsome boy is a low energy dog who loves every person he meets.  He loves going for his daily walk, and walks beautiful on a leash.  His favorite past-time is getting to smell all the smells and greet everyone he passes.  He is a calm and easy going dog that is happy to spend time inside with his person, looking lovingly into your eyes.  He is housebroken and crate trained, but is also trustworthy in the house uncrated.  He rides well in the car and actually rather enjoys road trips.  \n\nSome of you may remember him back when we first rescued him from a shelter in 2016 with a large, 2# tumor attached to his paw. After having that surgically removed and assessed at Texas A&M (benign growth), he then went through heartworm treatment and later found a home in early 2017.\n\nHowever, his story unfortunately didn't stop there. 4 months after he was adopted, his single mom experienced a terrible car wreck and was rushed to intensive care, temporarily going into a coma. Fortunately, a thoughtful neighbor knew about the situation and went over, every day, to take care of Kiitos, who was stranded alone at his house. We only became aware of the situation when the neighbor decided to call us from the info on his ARPH ID tag. We quickly went and picked him up and kept him in temporary foster care until his mom was able to be released from the hospital several weeks later... at which point, they were reunited.\n\nSadly, in the spring of 2018, we began receiving repeated calls from good samaritans that Kiitos was running loose... and despite every attempt to continue making it work, his adopter was no longer able to physically care for him and he was returned.\n\nSo... after all this... Kiitos is now, once again, searching for his final and permanent home.  \n\nHe is now approximately 10 yrs old, and keeps getting passed over due to his age.   We just hope that he can FINALLY find some stability in his life.  He is so full of love and affection that he would prefer to have all the attention to himself as an only dog, but we will consider a home with other dogs on an individual basis.  Originally, he was not a fan of felines, but over time, he has proven trustworthy with any indoor cat that is dog-savvy.\n\n\n",

He also knows to sit & wait for his food bowl. Rocco gets very protective of his area & will lunge & bark & even bite at you if he feels threatened. He also lunges and barks at vehicles.  He needs an owner who can be a strong leader.  He would do best in a rural home with with no other animals or children & a fenced yard attached. He needs his space. Homeward Bownd will reimburse Rocco's adopters, up to his adoption fee, for trainer costs.When Rocco finds his forever home, he will be a great addition. He has come a long way in the 3 years he has been with us. Rocco's adoption fee is $150.00.  You can complete an application for Rocco at homewardbownd.org. Adoption Application Form",

He gets along with other dogs and is especially close with his kennel mate, Lola.  Kova is loving and gentle with our staff but can be unpredictable and wary around strangers.  However, after a proper introduction, Kova is friendly, playful, and incredibly sweet.  He is also very smart and will learn new tricks easily.\n\nKova is looking for an active, loving home.  He will flourish with an experienced adopter that will take the time to establish trust with him and empower him to be the best dog that he can be.\n \n\n\n\n",

She absolutely adores all people, including kids. Unfortunately, she is not good with other dogs so she will need to be the only pet in the home. \n \n Sweetie is smart, learns quickly and is eager to please. She already is learning basic obedience commands and to walk on a leash, though she will need an adopter that will be committed to continue working on her leash manners. She loves to play with toys and will do best in an active home, as a typical boxer, is a higher energy girl. \n\n Check out Sweetie's video!! https://youtu.be/g4LlaBqsd8o\n\n  Sweetie does take medication for some skin allergies so her adopter will need to be agreeable to continuing her meds.  \n\n  \n\n  NOTE: SWEETIE IS CURRENTLY IN A BOARDING SETUP, AND NEEDS A FOSTER FAMILY-- PLEASE EMAIL UNDERDOG IF YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING!! \n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

We think he could excel at agility or obedience and likely other dog sports! He hasn\u2019t been trained to herd but shows herding instinct. \n\nWe\u2019ve fostered many border collies and other heeding breeds. He is more high drive than your typical border. He needs an experienced owner with an interest in training or dog sports. He would not do well living in an apartment or without a yard. \n\nHe is a very sweet boy who loves to snuggle as much as play! He is very loyal and wants to please his people.  He is housebroken and crate trained. This boy loves to play fetch as well as the weirdest way of pushing balls around the yard with his face! \n\nJinx has lived with many dogs and does well with most, but can be selective. To be cautious, he should not go to a home with small dogs. He is not a good candidate for going to dog parks. He is not good with cats. \n\nJinx is neutered,  vaccinated, heartworm negative, and microchipped. \n\nHe is not right for everyone, but he will be an amazing friend to the right family!\n\n*Jinx is a courtesy post,  please do not contact MUSHR but instead email his foster owner at megwagner@hotmail.com and include some information about your family. Jinx is fostered outside of the metro area, you must be willing to travel to meet him.*\n\nDue to the high level of interest in dog adoptions due to quarantine I\u2019m having trouble keeping up on inquiries. Emails will only be returned to perspective adopters who have read his bio and understand his needs.",

Our foster families need to be within 1-hour driving distance of our Vet in case the foster puppy needs to be seen while in foster care.  We are unable to approve foster homes more than 1-hour from Portland at this time, but encourage you to reach out to your local animal shelter to inquire about foster opportunities.\n\nWe work with rescue groups in the Magee, Mississippi area to rescue unwanted shelter puppies & dogs and find them loving homes in New England.  Since we do not have a physical shelter, our network of foster families commit to taking a rescue puppy or dog into their home and give him or her love, care and attention.  The average foster period is a week, but can be longer.\n\nWhy foster?\n\nFostering a dog is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have.  By taking a dog in need temporarily into your home you are:\n\u2022freeing up a spot so our rescue group can take in another dog.\n\u2022giving your foster dog the time he needs to be ready for adoption.\n\u2022helping our rescue group learn more about the dog so he can end up in the best home possible.\n\u2022socializing the dog to a home environment and possibly getting him used to being around other pets and different types of people.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about fostering, please e-mail our volunteers at helpingpawsme@gmail.com.  We do require all potential foster homes to complete our foster application which can be found at: helpingpawsme.org",

Most of your questions will be answered in this Biography.\n\n*House Trained\n*Crate Trained\n*Loves Kids\n*Loves to Play\n*Would do Best as an Only Dog\n*Doesn't Well With Cats\n\nZEE ZEE lives to be loved and she's not afraid to show it. Just check out those expressive eyebrows! She likes to play with her toys, chew on her bones, go for walks and snuggle on the couch. Her favorite game is playing fetch, hands down. Ball = Life for ZeeZee.\n\nHer spirit is so loving, and she just wants to soak up what life has to offer, all with the cutest tongue out smile on her face. Zee Zee loves children most of all. She wants to be part of an active home and in the middle of a loving family dynamic. She is crate trained, and potty trained. Though, she isn\u2019t fond of going out in the rain, like many other pups out there.\n\nZee Zee would do best as an only dog and doesn\u2019t prefer the company of other dogs, especially in close quarters. She does well with cats, so long as she has guidance on how to behave.\n\nShe is very much a people oriented dog, and never forgets her favorite humans. She regularly goes to daycare with her foster mom, where she gets showered with love and attention from the staff. She always waits patiently and calmly for a snack, and watches for the signal ahead before she eats her meals.\n\nAn ideal candidate for her adoption would be an adopter that is dog savvy, patient, active, kind and dedicated to continuing her personal growth. Her foster mom is a dog trainer who has spent a lot of time teaching Zee basic obedience and leash walking skills. Continuing her work is essential. (Her foster mom is happy to help out in that department, too!)\n\nZeeZee is a Boxer mix with an estimated date of birth of 1/6/2016. She is also vaccinated, microchipped and spayed.\n\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit our website at www.youluckydogrescue.org and read our Adoption FAQ's and Before You Adopt documents. In addition you can complete an online adoption application from our website. You can also email info@youluckydogrescue.org for additional details.\n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay or neuter and microchipping. All YLDR dogs are provided monthly heart worm & flea preventatives and heart worm tested annually beginning at the age of 12 weeks.\n\nThe breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog. We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue. \n\nWe are located in the metro Atlanta area. We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:  youluckydogrescue.org",

He was housetrained after only two accidents, so you can definitely teach an old dog new tricks, especially when they are as smart as this old man. \n\nThe veterinarian estimated Tam to be about 12 years old, but don't let his age fool you. He keeps up with his young foster sisters on the dog park trails and insists on jumping onto the porch instead of taking the stairs. His recent health check and blood work shows that he is very healthy for his age. He is blind in his left eye, but you would never know it. He is good around other dogs, cats, and children, and he loves to follow his foster mom everywhere she goes. He is an extremely sweet boy that deserves a good retirement home and a family to call his own. \n\nTam is fully vaccinated, neutered and ready to go home!\nPlease read the Adoption FAQ and get an Adoption Application approved before inquiring about Tam.",

Tossed out like a piece of trash!\n Thank God we were able to catch him.\n I took him home. Pogo was infested with fleas and was starving.\n It took me many months just for him to trust me. Pogo is still a bit shy of men.\n On May 3rd of 2016 I was able to get him neutered. This is when I found out he was heart worm positive. The vet I used was\n Clay Humane in  Orange Park. At that time they estimated him to be under two years old.\n Pogo is cat friendly. Pogo is not sure if he likes other dogs or not. I have kept him away from dogs because he gets nervous and cries. He could be dog aggressive but I have yet to find out.\n Pogo has been around other people, but not much. I am not sure if he likes children as I have not socialized him.\n Pogo is being treated for heartworms now.",

Trixie is 3yrs old, spayed, UTD on all shots and microchipped. She is housebroken, command trained and a really nice dog. She is shy at first but not aggressive, give her a few minutes and some treats and she becomes your best friend. Selective with other dogs. Give this poor mama dog a forever home. Apply today for this stunning girl.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Trixie please fill out the adoption application found under the Adopt menu on our website at savingpawsrescue.org or feel free to email us at info@savingpawsrescue.org",

She was surrendered to the rescue alongside her puppies who have since been adopted. \n\nWe don\u2019t know much about her history but could take a guess that she had a rough start in life. She had heartworms when she first came to us, which have since been treated fully, and a tail that looks like it may have been poorly cropped \u00be of the way down.\n\nShe\u2019s a smart gal, who loves to learn new training tricks, play with a ball, and snuggle up next to you while you watch TV. She aims to please and is learning something new every single day. \n\nBecause of her rough start, Sieva has needed some time to go through behavioral rehabilitation, and learn how to be a dog again. She still struggles with other animals, and would do best in a home without other animals or children present. \n\nHer ideal adopter would be someone who is patient, loving, kind and would continue her training. Structure, and routine help her thrive, and be the happy go lucky dog that she wants to be.\n\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit our website at www.youluckydogrescue.org and read our Adoption FAQ's and Before You Adopt documents. In addition you can complete an online adoption application from our website. You can also email info@youluckydogrescue.org for additional details.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay  or neuter and microchipping.  The breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog.  We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue.  We are located in the metro Atlanta area.   We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.",

Very cautious when first meeting, but a love bug and very obedient. He knows sit and stays with you with no reaction towards other dogs except being cautious with males because of his experience. He's been coming out of his shell very nicely, wagging his tail and walking great on a leash. His foster says that he is just the best & will make a wonderful forever friend to some lucky adopter. Who knows, that could be you!\n \nPlease contact us if you'd like to meet Edison!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jose.a.farias.77/videos/pcb.1284249648298902/1284241138299753/?type=3&theater\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jose.a.farias.77/videos/pcb.1284249648298902/1284241194966414/?type=3&theater\n\nVideo on Freedom Day! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncvB66vRuvs",

            "description": "Edison was found as a stray injured when he was attached by another dog. Edison does not get along well housed with other dogs. Very cautious when first meeting, but a love bug and very obedient. He knows sit and stays with you with no reaction towards other dogs except being cautious with males because of his experience. He's been coming out of his shell very nicely, wagging his tail and walking great on a leash. His foster says that he is just the best & will make a wonderful forever friend to some lucky adopter. Who knows, that could be you!\n \nPlease contact us if you'd like to meet Edison!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jose.a.farias.77/videos/pcb.1284249648298902/1284241138299753/?type=3&theater\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jose.a.farias.77/videos/pcb.1284249648298902/1284241194966414/?type=3&theater\n\nVideo on Freedom Day! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncvB66vRuvs",

Are you home during the day? \nCanine Humane Network is looking for foster homes for its rescue dogs.\n\n\nFostering a dog is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have.\n\nBy taking a homeless dog temporarily into your home you are giving your foster dog the time he needs to be ready for adoption and saving him from terrible conditions or in many cases, euthanasia. In addition, you are helping us learn more about the dog so he can end up in the best possible permanent home. Lastly, you are socializing the dog to a home environment and providing him with love and attention, helping your foster dog to grow in confidence and become a happy, well-adjusted pet!\n \nSo what exactly does fostering entail? \n \nWhen you become a foster, you agree to take a homeless dog into your home and provide care, love, and shelter while the adoption team finds a perfect forever home for your visitor. CHN provides you with all of the food, supplies, and support you need; all you need is a passion for helping dogs in need! \n \nIf you are interested in fostering a dog in need, please click the link below and fill out a new foster application! We can\u2019t wait for you to become part of our team!\n\nhttps://caninehumane.org/how-to-help/foster/\n\n",

He is house broke and knows his obedience commands very well.  This is a smart boy!  Chester is energetic and playful and loves attention.  He needs an owner that will be firm, but fair, and continue his training and socialization.  Chester does not care for other dogs, but adores his people. A home with a fenced yard would be best-he loves to run and do \"zoomies\".  Chester is quite smart and enjoys solving puzzle treat toys!  He is motivated by treats!",

He is full of love and is a big energetic dog. He loves to play with ropes and he loves to play in the kiddie pool water too. He has a lot of bouncing energy and would do best with someone who can work with his obedience training and who has the energy to match his.

            "description": "Born Oct. 2011, Maddie is our little Miss Cutie Patootie! She is a short and stocky malamute girl with so much personality. She is guaranteed to make you smile every day.  Maddie has a flirtatious personality but she needs to develop trust before you may reciprocate affection. She is called a little miss spitfire because she is a tough independent little cookie full of sass. She loves her crate where she feels safe & hanging outside supervising everyone and everything. She likes hiking too.\n\nMaddie is happy laying around on her doggy bed and being in the same room as you. Don't let that adorable teddy bear look fool you, she isn't a cuddler and prefers her space. She will give you a show with high fives, and becomes full of excitement for treat time! Just give her space and time to get to know you. \n\nShe had a very rough life and is hesitant to trust people. Despite this, she sits nicely to put her collar on before going on a walk. She also rides well in the car but generally speaking, Maddie doesn't just do things willingly, which is why force-free training works. She likes to protest a little bit just enough so she feels like she had a choice.  \n\nShe does not like other dogs but can be around them. If given the chance she will let other dogs know she is boss and that's why we recommend her as being the only dog in the home. When you are out on a walk she won't get upset seeing another dog as long as they are behaving. She isn't dog aggressive but won't back down from a challenge either. \n\nMaddie was debarked as a pup so she doesn't have her 'woo-woo' but don't let that stop you from giving this girl her second chance. She needs a home with Northern Breed & force-free dog training experience. She has a strict limited ingredient diet --- salmon only protein and fat. She loves KronchUSA salmon treats & cold pressed salmon oil. Typical malamute she cannot be around small dogs or pets including cats. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering this dog, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application. You may also complete an application online thru our web site, www.CHAAMP.org\n\nCHAAMP accepts applications ONLY from Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington DC. The information on your application will help CHAAMP determine which of our dogs is a good match for you and your family, based upon your lifestyle, other pets, etc. A home visit is required prior to all adoptions. Many of our dogs are fostered in private homes and cannot be visited until you have been approved for adoption. \n\nADOPTION FEES\n~Older dogs (eight years old or over) the adoption fee is $100.00 \n\nAll dogs are micro chipped, spayed and neutered and up to date on vaccines. These fees help us cover these costs.  The rates are higher for puppies because they require more visits to the vet and shots. \n\nCHAAMP IS NOT A SHELTER. We are volunteers over a 7-state area dedicated to helping Malamutes in our rescue area. You can read more about Malamutes and about CHAAMP by visiting www.CHAAMP.org",

            "description": "Reyna is a beautiful Shepherd/Doberman mix who was born in August 2016. She weighs about 50 lbs.  Reyna survived parvo as a puppy but unfortunately, was subsequently diagnosed with two other congenital issues - Megaesophagus (ME) and Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI).  Dogs with ME have a dilated esophagus due to lack of muscle tone, which causes food to sit in the esophagus rather than travel to the stomach. Reyna's ME is very mild and is managed by making sure she eats and drinks from an elevated feeder. EPI occurs when the pancreas does not secrete the enzymes needed to digest food and results in weight loss and diarrhea.  Reyna's EPI is managed by adding a supplement to her food that costs approximately $100 per month.  Both conditions are currently well-managed.  Reyna is good with most of the dogs in her foster home but can be pushy sometimes.  She likes to chase cats.  Reyna does not meet new dogs well \u2013 she becomes very defensive, so needs time to make new dog friends.  She is good with people but too active for small children.  She is housebroken and crate trained.  Reyna would love to have a family of her own.",

            "description": "TJ is such a great dog. He is approximately 3 yrs. old and loves people.  His excited state when seeing people he knows is to nip them on their fingers to get attention which could be alarming to small children therefore we believe he would do best with older children who would not be startled with this form of affection.  He does know the \"sit\" command and that helps to calm him down a little.  We believe he is a Staffordshire Terrier mixed with perhaps a boxer. He is currently fostered where he has to stay outside so we don't know if he is house trained.  He does have a large outside chain link kennel he stays in at night which has a designated area for relieving himself and he does use that area so we feel he would be easy to house train.  He isn't a big marker outside so we think that would not be a big issue inside the house but he would need to be watched to correct that issue should it arise.  He gets along with most dogs and has a best friend \"Sofie\" who he runs and plays with and they are in kennels next to each other.  We believe he would do best with a female dog since we already know he does so well with Sofie who is a girl.  We don't know how he is with cats.  Because our adoption process includes a home visit for a yard check, he is available for adoption in the immediate DFW area only. He is neutered, current on his vaccinations and heartworm tested and micro chipped.  If you are seriously interested in meeting TJ outside our adoption events you may email us for a questionnaire to fill out.  If it looks like your home would be a good match for TJ we can set up a meet and greet.  His adoption fee is $150.",

            "description": "Here's Johnny.....! He is an almost three year old chihuahua. He came in to Animal Control as a surrender after his owner died. He is a bigger Chihuahua weighing at about 12 pounds. Johnny is a tough case.... he is a \"bite now, ask questions later\" kind of dog. We couldn't even get him out of the kennel at Animal Control. After about 24 hours, he would let us handle him. His foster mom still cannot handle him if he is in his dog bed.... he will growl and bite and fight to the death. He wants to do everything on his own terms. He is hard to handle in terms of Frontlining, clipping nails, etc. He doesn't like to go outside, so he's been going on a potty pad. His foster mom can't always pick him up to take him out (bites). He does take food nicely from her hand and he will also jump up and sleep next to her, as well as let her hold him and pet him on her lap. She can also pick him up, provided she is not doing something he doesn't like (i.e., taking him outside). He gets along okay with the other dogs and he is okay with the cat too. So, his foster mom will keep working on Johnny. He is going to take a patient and loving, quiet home. Because Johnny is set in his ways, a home with small children is out of the question. Whoever adopts him will need to make sure he has his space. If he's in his bed, just leave him alone. AND, if you love WEIRDO dogs, then this dog is for you! He has come out of his shell a bit and will still bite on occasion, but not too often. He loves to play \"red light, green light\" with his foster mom. He will chase her if she turns around.... then if she faces him, he stops short. He gives weird kisses, but only on his own terms. He loves to get attention when she is sitting. Particularly in the bathroom. But sitting anywhere, he jumps up on her lap. He has a crazy side-eye. But the longer we get to know the little weirdo, he has grown on us. He brings new meaning to weird Chihuahua, that's for sure! Johnny is neutered, current on his vaccinations and micro chipped. His adoption fee is $135.

            "description": "Sprinkles is a little shy and is initially hesitant when meeting new people and dogs.  She likes other dogs and loves her people.  Once she's comfortable, she wants to snuggle up in your lap and grin at you.  \n\nWe guesstimate her birthday in Nov. 2012.  She weighs about 25 lb, so if you want a loving little white pup, sprinkled with color flecks, contact us :)\n\nSprinkles needs to be an only dog or in a home with bigger dogs.  She enjoys playing with other dogs and playing by herself - especially with squeaky toys.  She's house / leash / crate-trained.  She rides well in a car once she is confident in her handler.  Overall, Sprinkles is a calm, docile dog.\n\n*************\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

Everything appeared to be brand new to them and they needed to learn how to just be dogs. They've made tremendous progress and have really settled in to being a part of the family. \nShawn is 8 years old and weighs about 14 lbs and Kyle is 2 year old and weighs about 12 lbs. They seem to be a mixture of dachshund, chi, beagle and maybe a splash of min pin. \nThey get along with other dogs, though may bark at bigger ones until they get used to them. Cats are too much fun to bother. They are good with gentle teenagers.\nThe Shyles are a super-bonded pair and they'll need to be adopted together. They will do well in a home where they can move at a pace that's comfortable for them and we recommend an adopter who has experience with timid dogs. Once they settle in and trust, they are big cuddle monsters, love to play and are little mischief makers.",

He has been with us almost 4 years and calls our free roam sanctuary home until someone opens their heart and home to this wonderful boy.  He has made friends with multiple dogs and enjoys lounging under the shade trees or curled up on his bed inside. \nHe is a loving and very happy dog but suffers without medication to help with anxiety.  Due to a spinal condition that can effects his mobility he takes a joint supplement and anti inflammatory medication.   We love our little Animal and he loves us but we know he deserves the one on one attention he would receive in a home of his own.   A home where he can shine, and grow old with someone who will love him for all of his years.  \n\nAnimal is currently spending time at our sanctuary getting much needed one on one time and exercising in the play yards. Are you interested in meeting Animal? Please email traci.care@gmail.com for more information!\n\nAll C.A.R.E rescue dogs are fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, spayed/neutered, worm/flea free, and dogs are microchipped! So all you need to provide is the love.\n\nFill out an adoption application here: http://www.carerescue.org/dog-adoption\n\nOur adoption fee is a minimum $100 tax deductible donation. All donations are used for rescue and  medical care of animals in need.  If you don't have room to take home a pet but want to support our efforts to save animals in need, please consider making a donation. We are not city or state funded and rely solely on private donations that allow us to continue saving lives.\n\nTo learn more about us or to give a life saving donation please visit http://www.carerescue.org",

            "description": "Most of the animals listed here are in foster homes, but some are still residing at the Granite City Animal Control until they can be adopted or there is a foster home opening. Pound Pets Inc rescue can always use more fosters.  If you are interested in fostering, the foster application is located here: https://form.jotform.com/50784968756173\n\nOur Adoption Process: \n*You must complete an adoption application before meeting an animal.\n*We do all checks on references and vet checks. \n*Please let your references know we will be calling. \n*Once approved, you can set up an appointment to meet any of the animals at the Granite City Animal Control, or the ones in foster homes. \n*There will be a meet and greet and then a home visit.\n*After that you will sign an adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. \n\n$85 for Rabbits / $80 for Cats / $100 Kittens / $150 for Dogs / $200 for Puppies Six Months & Under\n\nThe dog adoption application is located here:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/31997643682166\n\nAll our animals are completely vetted with the required vaccinations, microchipped and spayed/neutered before leaving the rescue. \nIncluding: \nCats will have FIV/FeLV testing\nDogs will have Heartworm testing\nRabbits will have a wellness check \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nMany times we also get feral cats or semi-friendly cats (can be petted but doesn't like to be held) needing barn homes. You will need to provide shelter and food. There are not any adoption fees for barn cats (donations are accepted) but you will still need to fill out the cat adoption form. Just list the number of barn cats you are wanting. \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWe are a small foster based rescue but some of our animals are residing at the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois until they can be adopted, fostered or pulled by another rescue. \n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue can always use more fosters.\nIf you are interested in fostering, the foster application is located here:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/50784968756173\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nPound Pets volunteers cleans the animal control building, we are the caregivers for the animals brought in. Once they come through the door, they become our responsibility. We photograph all animals and post to the Pound Pets Facebook page. We provide them clean kennels, beds, blankets, toys, treats, outside play time, walks and human interaction. We try to comfort the scared, keep the high-energy ones exercised and provide plenty of love and affection to make their time at animal control as less stressful as possible. \n\nSometimes they get reclaimed by their families and sometimes they don't. If they don't it is our responsibility to find the adopters, fosters or rescues to save them from euthanasia. \n\nWe get in sick and injured animals as well. They do not sit in their kennels or cages needing veterinary care. Once we see the need for care they are taken to the vet. Sometimes the illness or injury is minor and the city will cover the bill, Other times when it's not, we do. We do all of this on our own dime. We buy the food, the beds, the blankets, the toys, and all the other things that go into care for the animals. Sometimes things are donated and that is wonderful!! We pay the medical bills that the city doesn't. As with most animal controls, there is a limit on what they will do or cover. At Pound Pets, there is no limit. Broken Bones, Surgery, Parvo, Heartworm, etc., if the animal has a chance the animal is given that chance. This is not a shelter but an animal control. \n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue can always use more volunteers.\nIf you are interested in volunteering, the volunteer application is located here:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/40307066949156\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWe are always looking for licensed rescues to pull cats (including FIV+ cats) and dogs from the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois. It's a very small animal control and strays keep coming in. There are no fees for a rescue to pull. If you can help us, please email the volunteers at poundpetsinc@gmail.com \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nPound Pets Inc Animal Control Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/poundpetsincorporated/\n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/poundpetsincrescue/",

What's your name? Do you want to play? Or go for a walk? I love going for walks. I behave very well on the leash and love to get out of the house. However, I do get nervous if there are other dogs or cats around. We don't tend to get along very well.\n\n I am very good with people, but I do best as the only dog. I can get protective of my food and space because other dogs can be a bit scary. I would love to go to training to help with my fear and I'm willing to work really hard. I've learned to play fetch and many other tricks, but I'm eager to learn more. Would you be willing to teach me?\n\n I also can jump really high, so I need a closed-in backyard with a high fence. I sometimes like to roam around the neighborhood, but I'm trying to be better. Other than that, I love being pet and getting lots of attention. I am very nice and will be the best dog I can be.\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

I am a strong, spunky girl and I love doing \u201czoomies\u201d.  If you need to know what \u201czoomies\u201d are my people can send a video to your people.  I am super friendly and love people.  I love easy going walks where I can stop and smell the roses on the way there and back, I also like to stop and talk to the neighbors.  I was an owner surrender at the local shelter and it really was a blessing in disguise for me.  I  absolutely love every human I meet.  Nothing can get this girl down.  Although I am a volunteer favorite at the rescue, I am at a foster home in Seattle but would love to have a comfy bed and some new digs to call home.  Oh, and did I mention that I love children!  If you have kids I\u2019m your girl.  I would even babysit for free\u2026well, maybe not for free.. it would cost you that bed I was talking about earlier.   \n\nP.S.  Don\u2019t let my serious face in the photos deter you\u2026I am as sweet as Southern sweet tea.  To meet me is to love me!\n",

Dani is an abuse case and has several injuries, including multiple upper and lower jaw fractures as well as a fracture to one of the bones in her left ear that assists with hearing.  Dani underwent weekly procedures for about 6 months and several surgeries and is now healed.  Unfortunately given the severity of the abuse, Dani will never appear normal but don't tell her that!  \n\nDue to the abuse, Dani suffers from Microcephaly.  Dani also has severe separation anxiety/stress induced anxiety.  We have seen numerous specialists for this and Dani has been on multiple prescription medication but unfortunately none of these have assisted.  We believe that much of this is due to her brain injury.  \n\nDespite all that she has been through, Dani is simply the happiest dog!  She does not know a stranger, 2 legged or 4 legged!  In typical lab fashion, she is an active girl but not overly active!   \n\nDani has earned her CGC, TDI, and CGCA titles.  \n\nDani cannot be crated.  She is about 90% housebroken but will have accidents once she is stressed and she will spin in her accidents.   \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Dani, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org.  Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions.  Thank you.\n\nPlease note:  All of our dogs are fostered locally a minimum of 2 weeks.  Adopting a dog that has been fostered locally is a very important consideration. Animals that are fostered locally in private homes allow the fosters to learn more about the dogs personality and allows for making the best match possible.  Also, animals that are transported into our area and placed directly often carry diseases, including parvo and distemper.  Animals can also become ill on transports to the northeast, as they are exposed to other animals in route.  If you have any questions regarding these diseases and the risks of not adopting locally, please contact your vet.  \n\nAlso consider any group that does not require a home visit.  If they are not conducting a home visit consider if they are vested in where their animals go.  As an organization, we invest a significant amount of time into all of our dogs, including crate training, house breaking, obedience training, and determining each dog's personality to consider making the best match possible.\n\nHelp Orphan Puppies is registered with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Our Rescue Registration Number is RR047.\n\nPlease note that Petfinder requires us to identify a breed/breeds.  We do our best to determine a puppy's breed but without both parents present, we are unable to guarantee a puppy's breed.",

She is a mega-watt cutie who hasn't let a single challenge dim that irresistible smile. Diamond would make a valuable companion for an active family that can (try to) keep up with her!\n\nMiss Diamond has had a turbulent few years; her former owner was unable to keep her and reached out to Adopt-A-Dog to try and re-home her. This resilient pup quickly settled in at our shelter, and started revealing the quirky personality underneath. Some of Diamond's favorite activities are: leaves, chin scratches and playing fetch. She is completely house-trained, and is now just looking for a family to take her on runs and who will always have a ball ready to play fetch.\n\nThis Diamond in the rough deserves a soft bed and pile of tennis balls to call her own. Fill out an application below if you are interested in bringing her home!\n\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7",

She prefers a hands off approach until she is comfortable \u2013 but would love to toss toys with you right off the bat! \n\nLove all the time! Lulu loves attention! She\u2019s all about as much affection as she can receive! After slow and gentle introductions with people, her bold and expressive heart appears and she will shower you her smiling face, toys and snuggles on the couch.  She\u2019ll share everything with people and everything but food with dogs. She\u2019s a wonderful hangout buddy but needs mental and physical stimulation to keep her happy and settled in for the evening!\n\nImpressive resume! Lulu is a smart gal. She already knows the commands look, touch, sit, down, shake, go to bed and is working on spin! She\u2019s even learning the name of toys. She could certainly learn a lot more! Cars, baths, brushing\u2026no problem! She\u2019s housetrained and she\u2019s so good, she doesn\u2019t really need a crate, but handles the crate well.\n\nNot perfect but close! Lulu needs slow introductions to everyone, especially dogs. She\u2019s also best with dogs with similar energy levels as her. With people, she needs slow introductions and minimal touching until she trusts them. \n\nLulu is happiest with lots of walks and/or runs especially if you live in an apartment. Her ideal family will give her regular outlet for exercise but she doesn\u2019t need you to be super physical. She simply needs energy outlet and love. \n",

She is also good with kids over age 10 yrs.  \n\nTypically Huskys are small animal prey driven, which means they can not be placed with small animals, including small dogs and cats.  They also do not do well in apartments, unless the owner has a very active lifestyle.  \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoptions at C-A-L Ranch, located at 232 N Jones Blvd, Las Vegas, right off the I-95, on the weekends from 10-4.  Please email us to confirm the dog you are interested in will be attending that particular weekend.   We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to adoptions. Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet ( if applicable ). \nIf you are interested in this husky, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to find out which location  he/she will be at this weekend. \n\nHuskys are altered, current on vaccinations,  microchipped and come with a free vet visit. Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information below before contacting one of our volunteers. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed please contact us regarding how you can foster or volunteer for our organization.\n\nHusky adoptions may require a home check prior to placement.",

He is senior dog but still full of energy and loves to run, play ball, and lounge on comfortable furniture - not surprising after his early life chained up outside. Finley still has some lingering allergies that require attention, but very manageable. He loves everyone he meets. He may be best a single dog or with a non-dominant dog.

            "description": "ONE PERSON DOG, needs House and Yard.  NJ\n\n4y 75lb Bruno Brunelli needs a solo person home.\nBruno is everything we love about the bully breeds: Very friendly, loose wiggly body and a waggy tail. He allowed counselor to pet him and rub his belly. He knows his commands of sit and stay. He allows all handling As per the client Bruno is house broken and friendly towards strangers. He has never bitten or scratched anyone to his knowledge. Bruno will chew up shoes if they are left out--so don't leave your shoes out as chew toys! Best in a home w/ no small children due to his energy, and because he is a big boy, w/ experienced bully adopters who know enough to be the alpha in the pack:)  He can be a bit territorial about his toys and food w/ other dogs so we think his ideal situation is a home w/ a yard and access to other doggies for playtime.  He definitely is not a city critter.  He loves puppies of all sizes and is a purrfect puppy nanny--Very tolerant of their play style.  \n\nA volunteer writes: Bruno is a wiggly, playful, sweet bundle of joy! He pulls a little on leash, seems housebroken, sits for treats, and manages to immediately initiate a romance with any tennis ball he finds! I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever met a dog who entertains himself as well!. He play bows with the ball, waltzes with it, rolls on his back with it, eventually chews it up, and then starts the whole cycle with the next one. Just watching him is enough to put a smile on anyone\u2019s face, but he also loves interacting with people (and, so far, other dogs too!). He seems to be one of those dogs who sees a friend in every stranger (the kind of friend he can give kisses to and get belly rubs from!), but I can only imagine the extra-special-lovin\u2019 he has reserved for his family. \n\n11/08/2016 BEHAVIOR AVERAGE Client came to drop off a dog that he stated was left in his apartment by his roommate. Intact, Owner Surrender Previously lived with: Adults\nSAFER ASSESSMENT: 11/8/16 Look: 1. Dog\u2019s eyes are averted. His ears are back, his tail is down, and he has a relaxed body posture. Dog allows head to be held loosely in Assessor\u2019s cupped hands. Sensitivity: 1. Dog leans into the Assessor, eyes soft, soft and loose body, open mouth. Tag: 2. Dog is not fearful, but is unresponsive to the Assessor, and approaches the Assessor at the end of the game (need coaxing to approach.) He is focused on stimuli other than the Assessor. Squeeze 1 & 2: 1. Dog does not respond at all for three seconds. His eyes are averted and his ears are relaxed. Toy: 1. No interest. Summary: No concerns were seen on this assessment.\nDOG-DOG INTERACTION ASSESSMENT: Summary PLAYGROUP: Bruno was surrendered as a stray so his past behavior around dogs is unknown. When off leash with dogs at the Care Center, Bruno engages in gentle play with male and female dogs. He is sexually motivated but able to continue to play when solicited. The Behavior Department recommends that Bruno be placed in a home with dogs that match his gentle play style and that a dog-dog interaction be conducted to ensure compatibility. MEDICAL BEHAVIOR: 11/04/16 During his initial medical examination, Bruno readily allowed all handling without issue. ENERGY LEVEL: Bruno displays a high activity level in the care center. RECOMMENDATIONS: Average (suitable for an adopter with an average amount of experience) Note: see potential challenges section below Potential challenges: _X_Destructive behavior: Bruno is a young, active, enthusiastic dog with lots of energy. He will need daily mental and physical exercise and stimulation to channel that energy appropriately. He is also reported to chew up shoes if they are left out, so this will need to be managed in his future home.\n\n11/05/2016 GROUP BEHAVIOR EVALUATION When off leash with dogs at the Care Center, Bruno engages in gentle play with male and female dogs. He is sexually motivated but able to continue to play when solicited. The Behavior Department recommends that Bruno be placed in a home with dogs that match his gentle play style and that a dog-dog interaction be conducted to ensure compatibility. 11/5: Bruno displays loose and wiggly body language when greeting a novel female dog. He displays bouncy body language when the female solicits play. He explores the pen for a bit before attempting to mount again. 11/8-11/13: In a group of playful male and female dogs, Bruno displays soft body language when greeting the novel dogs. He is playful, engaging in and soliciting gentle play. He tolerates novice play styles.\n\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted here)\nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends \nTwitter: zanisff \n\nPlease fill out an application at http://zanisfurryfriends.org and return to \ndogs@zanisfurryfriends.org \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Sundays and sometimes on Saturdays--please ask by writing us at dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application by Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n\nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nNala is such a pretty pittie!\n\nThis beautiful lady is Nala, a 4-year-old female Pit Bull Terrier mix. She has a smooth chocolate brown and white coat and is a good size dog weighing about 58 pounds.  Nala was pulled from our local animal shelter where she had been surrendered by her owner and down there for almost 3 months.  She had been adopted out one time down there but returned.\n\nNala is very friendly, playful and full of energy.  She loves to play with toys, especially tennis balls.  She would be a great dog to take on long walks, hiking or jogging cause she has a lot of stamina.\n\nNala plays well with other dogs and should be fine with children ages 12 and up. She may have too much energy for an apartment.  She will require a fenced in yard and a home visit will be done to verify.  We have started on her crate training. Nala is up to date on her vet care, spayed, heartworm negative and is microchipped.  She is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nNala is a very loving dog that will make a great companion for a very lucky owner!\n\nOur adoption fee is $75. Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html. Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

He was found abandoned and neglected unable to walk. After spending time at a local animal control, he went through an extensive rehabilitation to be able to walk again. Denver also has a bad skin condition and is now heart worm free. Denver gets along with other dogs in his household. Denver can be possessive of his yard and home (with other new animals), as that is a trait of the black mouth cur breed. To see more about Denver, visit his Facebook page www.facebook.com/aprdenver  \n\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.\nIf interested in adoption, please complete an online application on Alcovy Pet Rescue's website at www.alcovypet.com. You must have a vet reference to adopt. We verify the care of past/current pets. Applications without a vet reference will not be approved for adoption. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs and cats and therefore we reserve the right to approve or deny an application based on what we determine is in the pet's best interest.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Tate, but you can call me Tater or Tato, like my foster family does. I was born in September of 2016 under a shed in a rural area outside of Atlanta and boy am I lucky that a rescue group found me and my siblings and took us in.\n\nMy Mom was a Border Collie mix and I am not sure about Dad but he was obviously one handsome dude. I am a medium size dog and weigh about 40lbs.  I am house trained and crate trained and I\u2019m a super smart boy. My foster mom says I\u2019m the smartest dog she\u2019s ever had but I have a lot of anxiety and am very nervous in new situations and with new people. Once I feel comfortable though I am just a big goofball and my favorite thing to do is snuggle. I need a home that will understand that I do not like to do the things that most dogs do, like go for walks. I prefer to stay inside where I feel safe so I will  need someone to be patient with me and give me time to get acclimated.  I will do best in a home without small children or other pets and with a fenced yard.\n\nI am looking for my forever family. Wanna meet me? Just send an email to info@barkvilledogrescue.org or submit an application for me at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications\n",

He does better with females.   Shiloh may not do quite so well with a male dog but loves to play with some female dogs. He keeps himself occupied with toys and running in and out of the house, but would do best with another small female dog he gets along with. Loves car rides and walks well on a leash. He can be cautious when dogs approach him. Is good with kids but not small ones that would make fast loud moves. Children over 10 would be better as he still gets frightened with sudden noise and movement. He is not cat friendly.  He does well in a crate but should not be in for long hours. He is potty trained with a doggie door.\n. \n\nThis dog's adoption fee is a minimum $200.00 donation to help us save more dogs. Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue, SoAZBR is an all-volunteer group. One hundred percent of your donation is used for the care and treatment needy beagles. Your donation is 100% tax deductible, too.\n\nWe URGENTLY need fosters so we can help save more dogs.

Thanks soooo much for making adoption your first option - so many of my buddies need to get adopted too... so tell a friend to visit our website and help in the goal to have more pups find forever homes. If you are viewing me on Petfinder or one of the other rescue portals - please go to our main website: www.tlcwithpups.com - where you can find our adoption fees and our main profiles. There and you can fill out an application too. If you want it expedited be sure and call 951-742-8689 and email us at beaglesrbest@yahoo.com for faster service.",

With my own brand of surprises, life with me will keep you constantly on your toes, and the fun is guaranteed. (Socially motivated)\"\n\nPrepare for wiggles and a dog that thinks he's part Kangaroo! Po is very nervous of new people, especially strange men, and strange dogs. We are looking for a relaxed household with experience (or someone willing to attend training classes) to help this boy overcome his past and social issues. Once he opens up to new people he is a total charmer, however and he is sure to be the goofball of the family. He would not do well in a family with children under 13 years old, or in a home with other dogs. This is merely so we can set him up for success. He had a rough start at the beginning of his short life: an island dog with no home, and then a lack of socialization made him unsure of his world. He's learning that people can be good, but he's got a ways to go. Once you are his person he wants to protect you, and he is as happy as can be. If you think you could be the knight in shining armor that Po is looking for, please give us a call to set up an appointment to meet this sweet boy. You can also email our trainer at jessica.barlow@aacspca.org for more info about him.",

When I was rescued, I had no coat at all and now everyone says I'm the most handsome guy around. I like to play with other dogs and I'm a good boy in the house. I live with cats and other dogs and do well when I'm out on walks. I like to live the active Florida life. I love to snuggle and be with people. When I eat my meals, I need to be fed soft food by hand because of an issue with my larnyx. I'm otherwise healthy though. Come see me in Seminole, just  north of St Pete. \n\u00a0\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nTo apply to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida, please visit our website at http://www.lrrof.org. Your support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today.\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family! All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison.

            "description": "This guy loves to be outside so a person w/ a lot of outdoor time and then snuggly time is Zazu's ideal home.  But he is for EXPERIENCED adopters only, a solo person in the home, no guests, no children and not in a City environment.\n\n8y 38lb Zazu fka Zebracake is a good looking gent, reasonably well groomed and dressed in a lush dark chocolate and black coat. His amber eyes light up his face. His muzzle is very slightly grey, and his mouth opens often into a lovely smile. Zazu is a little shy in his kennel, but gets leashed fairly rapidly. He is a very good walker, marks a little his territory, and eyes the pigeons as well as the squirrels in the park. Well, he is just doing his job, as he is part of the herding group of dogs. Zazu does not mind being stared at by me and the camera. He will sit on command, and is not at all interested in my treats that I thought were quite tasty. He seems to like my caresses all over his body. He is a really very gentle and well-mannered pooch. As we were early visitors at a nearby park, we did not meet many dogs, and those we encountered did not elicit much attention from Zazu.  He is an easy going character, friendly, a little shy\u2013at least inside our walls\u2013and a lovely Collie/Retriever mix who is sure to attract connoisseurs of the breeds. \n\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted here)\nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends \nTwitter: zanisff \n\nPlease fill out an application in copy/paste format into the body of the email at http://zanisfurryfriends.org and return to dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Sundays and sometimes on Saturdays--please ask by writing us at dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application by Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes or in boarding so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n\nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

I get so excited to explore that I sometimes pull on my leash. I also like to imagine my next adventure, so I love to look out windows to see what's going on. I would love to go do whatever my humans are planning on doing. \n\nWhen I'm not adventuring, I love to take naps on the couch, especially after I eat. I also love to climb up on the couch and snuggle with my humans and give them as many kisses as possible. \n\nMy foster mom said I would be great for a couple who likes to go out and about on weekends walking or camping or something as long as they are willing to train me on how to be a good girl.",

This pretty girl is very affectionate, such a sweetie and a total people pleaser. She loves playing fetch, getting pets and running around in the play yard.  Bella is good on a leash and would love a home that enjoys going for walks and adventures. Bella does need to be the only dog companion in the house, no cats either. Bella will do best with kids 10 years old or older.  Bella is house and kennel trained as well.\n\nBella will do best in a home that is willing to continue her training needs, keep her active and make her part of a day to day routine.\n\nIf you would love to meet gorgeous girl, please fill out an adoption interest form at www.pittiemerescue.org/forms.html.\n\nBella\u2019s adoption fee is $75 and covers her vaccines, rabies, microchip and spay",

Found walking across 5 lanes of traffic, a very busy intersection. with 2 people who didn't care.  No leash and I flipped around thru a gas station, a red light and pulled into a shopping center asking if he was their dog...NO...fine...I looped him.  Happy Boy!  My truck was empty of stuff...back doors open...he didn't want any of it!  No jumping up and I had my work clothes on...don't get me dirty...dog!  I shut all the doors and went for my passenger front seat - oh boy - he was ready for the Ride!!!  Jumped right in!\n\nSomebody's dog...neutered, clean, happy boy, Lost with a collar and no tags, drove him straight to the vet to scan for a microchip...nothing!\n\nSo I posted Found on websites, put up fliers, nothing...no Lost signs either...oh well.\n\nHe needs a family who cares!  He's pretty good on leash, wants back in the house!  But he jumps on the door - and out he goes...probably why he was Lost!.\n\nHe loves the fenced in back yard and is happy to come when called.  He's young, happy and will stay that way here.  Great in his crate, tail waggles at everyone he meets, gets really excited at children playing in neighborhood...speaks Spanish, I'm sure...  Playing great with Lexi (listed separately).  He was HW positive, and now he's negative!\n\nfor more Info - call Julie 770-329-4742 or email for application:  jachambers4806@yahoo.com\n\nPet Adoptions - Sat. 2-6 pm - call ahead for attendance and location.",

She would do best with no other animals in the house though she does fine when out on walks and loves to play with the other dogs across the fence. Basia currently weighs 60 pounds and would do very well with a family with a fenced yard so she can get the appropriate exercise.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190.

            "description": "Meet Carson Dukes. His eyes (one blue, one brown) are unique and strikingly gorgeous, one myth even says that dogs with two different color eyes can view heaven and earth at the same time.\n\nCarson is an adult Border Collie mix who has been with us since he was just a pup. Like some of our others he can be a bit shy and timid around new people so he would benefit from an adopter who is willing to spend some time with him at our kennel. Once he figures out who will be his friend he is very loving. Oh, and he is a bit of an escape artist, six feet or chain link does not hold a challenge for him. He never leaves us; he just doesnt like to be fenced. Carson would be a great indoor companion with supervised outdoor exercise. \n\nCarson recently spent some time in a foster home. He adjusted well to being a house dog, is crate trained, and almost housebroken. He got along with the other dogs, really enjoyed stretching his long legs running and playing in the yard, and was happily contained with the 8ft privacy fence. His foster family describes him as, \"lovable, sweet, playful, and quirky in the most endearing way.\" \n\nCarson's adoption fee includes neuter, microchip, current vaccinations, and up to date heartworm/flea/tick prevention.\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

            "description": "Ruben & Tyler are a BONDED pair and being returned to our rescue after 4 years and need an foster home ASAP!!\n\nEstimated date of birth: 8/15\nRuben has an interesting story that proves he is a true survivor in the harshest of environments.  Back in April 2016, some very kind citizens in Stockton noticed 3 little dogs running around the area where the City Food Bank is located.  Not a very safe area for dogs to be wandering off leash.  These dogs were very skiddish.  They were able to catch Shirley, then a few weeks later her brother Tyler, but little Ruben went MIA, but would show up now and again, all by himself, alone and scared.  The citizens never gave up on him and continued to try to get him to safety.  Well, they finally succeeded.  He is a shy boy, but when he is in a safe stable environment, he comes out of his shell and loves to be a lap doggy.  He also likes to snuggle in bed with you, but is crate trained as well.  Little man Ruben deserves a wonderful home where he will be cherished and kept warm and safe. He is neutered, microchipped and current on his vaccines. If you'd like to meet Ruben,  please contact EOE at eoerescue@yahoo.com, or 209-815-5186",

My name is Java!\n\n Here's what you need to know about me: I am a great family dog that is looking for a forever home. I love playing fetch, playing with my toys, and playing with my humans. I can be on the protective and territorial side, but that's only because I want to keep what I love as safe as possible. I'm looking for a family that's willing to work with me to feel more comfortable so I don't have to be on guard all the time. I know my basic commands, but I'm always eager to learn more. I am very smart, after all.\n\n Besides all that, I do well in the car and like to go on walks. I'm eager to please my humans all the time and love when they give me lots of affection. I am a big ball of love and I strive to show it the best way I can.\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

This boy is only 17 months old but has a nice maturity about him. He readily leans up against the person who is next to him. He walks nicely on leash. He was described by the person in Florida from who we got him as a 'sweet goofy young'un'. He is one of those 'mooshy' boys that we have come to love. Johnny is 17 months old and although he loves people, no cats, please.Update by Prison Inmate who is her primary handler in the Prison Foster Program:'I think my dog would be great to adopt for several reasons such as he is easy going and docile. He has good qualities such as being very friendly, not barking aimlessly, and good house etiquette. Johnny can make a great addition to a family.'Foster Update 4/3/32015Broadway Johnny--He is just a baby, he turns 2 at the end of April. Johnny loves to be with people and enjoys the company of other dogs. He is always happy to go out side and play with toys. Johnny will need to be adopted into a family with another dog. Johnny would be very happy if he could snuggle with other dogs. He is so sweet and just wants to please.",

He is playful and sweet with his foster furry and human siblings. \n\nHe would love a family with no small children, but will need a patient, experienced owner that is willing to love him through some initial possible marking, resource guarding and stubbornness.  He is crate trained and potty trained.  He eats and sleeps in his crate!  He is improving with his collar sensitivity but new owners will need to work with him as well.  \n\n**He NEEDS AN EXPERIENCED OWNER! We will not accept applications for first time owners!**\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an adoption and you live in Texas , please complete the application (links provided below). The process includes a vet check, calling references and doing a home visit. \n\nhttp://www.texassleddogrescue.org/web_documents/tsdr_application.pdf\nor\nhttps://www.formstack.com/forms/?1632205-WX2Zb144ZP\n\nPlease note the following:\nWe rarely do out of state adoptions.  (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience and will require same adoption process.)\nChildren in the home or that visit often must be at least 6 years of age. (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience.)\nAdoption donation is due at the time of adoption.  Puppies under 1 year are $300. Dogs 1 year to 7 years are $200 and dogs over 7 years are $150.  As this is a donation, it will be non-returnable if dog is returned to rescue.\nDogs are not placed on a \"first come, first serve\" basis but rather the best home for the dog. \nAll dogs placed by TSDR will be:\nspayed/neutered\nvaccinated for distemper/parvo, rabies, and bordetella\nheartworm tested and treated if needed\nmicrochipped\nother vetting as deemed needed\nNew owners will receive copies of all available vet information and must agree to keep them current on all of the above.",

He loves to be on the go, but is often happy for a good romp in the yard. Pretty much if his humans are doing it, he is down for it.and at the end of the day, he is happy to settle in for some couch time and a good cuddle.\n\nBane is crate trained and has good house manners. He knows his basic obedience and loves to learn. \n\nBane gets along with dogs medium and up, though he can be overwhelming for some dogs. True to the Terrier in him, he has prey drive. So small dogs cats and other creatures of small and furry variety are a no go for him. Bane does love humans of both the large an small variety, he just requires that they adore him too. \n\nThis boy has energy to burn and can be high drive. So daily exercise is an absolute must. He needs a 6 foot privacy fence to keep him safe. Our bully breed adoption guidelines apply.\n\nBane is ready to find his Happy Ever After, if you feel it may be with you and submit an application. \n\nBane's adoption fee is 250.00 and he is fully vetted\n\nAdopter must be local to the Saint Louis Metro area.\n\nInterested adopters must submit an adoption application through our website, steppingstonebully.org to be considered.",

            "description": "Pixie is a member of the Dolly Goodpuppy longtimer's club who is hoping 2019 is the year she finds her forever home.\n\nPixie has been with us since she was just a pup and is repeatedly overlooked by adopters as she is timid around new people. It takes her a little bit to adjust and be comfortable with strangers but once she does, she is as happy as can be. Being shy is Pixie's only fault; she is playful, fun, spunky, loving, overall a nice medium-sized terrier mix who plays well with other dogs. Pixie would benefit from a home with a confident dog and patient humans to help her overcome some of her shyness. In fact, a family willing to spend time with her at the kennel would be ideal.\n\nWe really would love for Pixie to find a family where she will be loved, adored, spoiled, and finally know what \"home\" feels like.\n\nPixie is crate trained, up to date on shots, spayed, microchipped, and current on heartworm/flea/tick prevention.\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting? complete our application at dollygoodpuppy.org\n\nPLEASE NOTE: At this time we are unable to adopt out of state and are not accepting applicants located outside of Georgia.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Chunk and I am an American Bulldog, Staffordshire mix. I am known as an AMERICAN BULLY.\n I am a short dog, but I weigh over 75 lbs. I was recently surrendered to Valhalla Rescue with my friend, when my people moved and could not take me with them. I am friendly with other dogs that are friendly with me, but i do better with girl dogs. I love people, but I do need a little slow introduction because before I came in to rescue I spent my entire life in a fenced backyard with little interaction with new people. But I do love the way everybody's been so nice to me and it only takes me a couple minutes to warm up to you\n\nThe rescue has really helped me come a long way. I had yeast infections in my ears and on my skin, I had bad eye lids called entropia which is common for the breed, they neutered me and gave me all my vaccines. I am doing so much better now and I'm ready to find my new forever home. I've been okay with cats so far but no one has left me alone with them yet and I like kids but sometimes I can get a little excited and may knock one over because I weigh so much.\n\nMy adoption fee is $300 and it helps to ensure that Valhalla Rescue can continue to help dogs like me. A wonderful group of people dedicated to helping dogs with medical conditions get the treatments they need and then find their forever homes. Without them I would still be in bad condition in someone's backyard.\n\n If you are interested in adopting me visit their website and submit an online application. Www.valhallarescue.org.  you can also call them at 360-559-4972 for more information.\n\nThank you so much for taking a look at me and I look forward to meeting you soon!!!",

He gets excited over playing ball, or playing in his water trough, which he absolutely loves!  \n\nBear was found living on his own on a vacant lot where trash was being dumped.  He was emaciated and had no food or water.  For almost 6 wks, food and water was hauled to him twice daily until his trust was gained.  He made his freedom ride to Acres of Love Animal Rescue fairly well and now has his own yard, and even comes inside when weather conditions get extreme.  Bear is just the happiest boy I've ever seen with personality plus.  Loves to be groomed, bathed and smooched on!\n\n**Bear MUST BE NEUTERED BEFORE ADOPTED**",

She runs and walks and she doesn't seem to be in any pain. She doesn't realize that she has a handicap and everyday we see improvement. She is now ready for her forever home.Sienna was surrendered to a local shelter and pulled by a good Samaritan with the intention of finding a rescue. We were eventually contacted and Sienna became an ATDR dog in July! The vet specialist believes she was hit by a car and is very wobbly in her rear. Originally what the shelter thought was IVDD or a back injury appears to be the aftermath of some kind of trauma. She is learning to walk again and very unsteady on her feet thus far. She will be receiving special cold laser treatments and accupunture to try to get her to bounce back from her injuries and possibly walk again. Please say a prayer for this beautiful girl that she will one day walk without problems and find a home to love her forever! If you'd like to sponsor this baby by making a small monthly donation for her laser treatments there is a donation button on our home page. We have seen some improvement on her laser treatments.\n2017 UPDATE: Sienna aka Miss Wiggles is in a new foster home. She got her nick name on her first day because when her foster put a slip leash on her to take her out for a walk, it took exactly 2 seconds for her to wiggle out of it. Sienna is an energetic, happy, sweet baby who doesn't know she has a disability. She races around the house playing with her Doxie friends and the cats in her foster home. She is head strong and pushes her way to the front of the line for dinner and for pats and loving. This girl doesn't want to be left out of anything and doesn't want to be left alone. She's good with cats, good with dogs both small and large, and probably would be good with children.",

We believe he was left tied outside most of his life. We aren\u2019t sure who cut his rope when the water started to rise but the person surely saved his life. The firemen cleaned him up, fed him & contacted APAWS. Sparky does well in the car, likes toys, playful, affectionate & goofy. We believe Sparky to be a Shepherd/Lab mix, approximately 4yrs 7month old(June), approximately 64lbs(July), neutered, microchip, current on age appropriate vaccinations & working on finishing his house training. He is good with kids, other dogs & even cats! Sparky wold do best in a home with another dog for him to play with. Please consider opening your heart & home to Sparky.\n\nIf you would like more information on this dog please contact Apaws at info@apawspets.org\nif you would like to begin the adoption process and fill out an application please use our online application available here: http://www.apawspets.org/dog_application_display.php\nif you cannot adopt or foster, but would like to donate to the rescue to help with the care of this dog and the others, please go to http://www.apawspets.org/donate.php",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. located in Romoland CAA little rough around the edges, Cedar is a mix of confident gentleman meets backyard bruiser, but he is mostly misunderstood. Cedar was in an abusive home before coming to the Akita Ranch which is why he can still have some trust issues in new situations. But deep down he is much more refined and likes to take care of his own. Working with him during his time at the ranch we have seen much growth from some of the issues he had when he arrived: he can be food aggressive but has learned to trust with his food if you give him space and a safe place to eat, he is selective with people he meets but is very willing to follow the lead of a person he trusts. He is very responsive to a respectful, loving person who is willing to train him with consistent positive reinforcement training and give him his space when he needs it. Once he feels safe, he will come to you on his own and loves scratches and affection. Due to humans who broke his trust many times, for a time, he will keep an eye on you until he sees that you are dependable and he then begins to let down his guard. Cedar is a noble, honest, character and one of the greatest personalities at the ranch. He really wants to make his people happy but needs time and patience to continue to overcome the pain from his past. He walks well on leash, loves going for car rides, is very well-mannered at the park and in new situations if his person understands his limits and respects his fears. If you have patience and a tender heart, and are willing to help him work through his past, Cedar would love to grow with you and see what this great big world has to offer!\n\nCome meet debonair Cedar at Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA (open 10-5, 7 days)\nor email: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information.\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

            "description": "Due to COVID-19, our Sanctuary is temporarily closed, with a small number of staff running our daily operations. For this reason, we are suspending  adoptions and tours for an undetermined amount of time. While we will try to respond to emails and phone calls as best we can, we do not have a dedicated office staff and are prioritizing the care of our animals and health of our staff.\n\nWe want to thank you for your understanding, patience, and support during this time. \n\nHutch was a transfer from the SFSPCA with his brother Rickie. They were overwhelmed by the noise and activity of the city and needed a quiet place to decompress and process all the changes in their life. Hutch is a shy, funny and quirky dog who loves treats and curling up in a warm and comfy bed. He would do best in a quiet predictable home. He frequently stays in the sanctuary manager's office during the day and is happy to nap away the day on a couch or in an ex pen with other small dogs. If you are looking for a small dog with low exercise needs and a cat-like personality, Hutch may be your guy!\n\n\n\nAll of our animals are up-to-date on their vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, and have had a physical exam. At adoption we provide: veterinary records and vaccine certificates, castration certificate, lifetime lost animal support, one month\u2019s worth of flea medication and heartworm medication, one week\u2019s worth of food, a leash, a collar, an ID tag, and a familiar toy or blanket to help them settle in. We also provide lifetime basic positive training support.",

Foster mom thinks it would be best if my mom and I are adopted out as a bonded pair. We are pretty much inseparable and I have been with Tiffin (my mommy) all of my life. If mommy can't see me, she starts crying and searching all over. I am so happy that foster mom and dad have discovered this, we will be together always and forever.\n\n My name is Taffy and I'm a very small Coated Xolo. My coloring is remarkable, I am a bowl of ice cream sundae for your eyes! A little bit of this and a little bit of that and you get a beautiful girl like me. I have stunning eyes and a beautiful coat. I get along with other pups, but when it's feeding time, I need to be crated to eat because I just might eat someone else's food and I will let everyone know what my intentions are.\n\n I came from Mexico where my previous owners wanted me to be euthanized. They didn't want us anymore. My goodness, I'm only two years old and deserve far better than that!A very nice lady came to my mommy's (Tiffin) and my rescue and saved us from sure death. This nice lady brought us all the way to the United States so we have a better chance of being adopted to a loving family.\n\n I love other pups as long as I am introduced to them slowly. I was bred to hunt squirrels, so I need to stay on my leash at all times while I'm out for a walk. I do need a fenced in backyard, and it must be secure. I can jump pretty high and I can run fast!\n\n I saw my doctor today, I am HW negative, UTD on all of my vaccinations, spayed and microchipped. I am ready for my forever home! I couldn't possibly be any more healthy than I am now.\n\n I love people, I love to give kisses and I make the perfect lap pup. It did take me a small minute to warm up to my foster daddy, but we are inseparable now. No small children for me, I am very fine boned and need older children that can respect my small stature. I'm a lion in a small package!",

            "description": "Thunder is a handsome 7 year old WOLF DOG Shepherd/ Malamute mix. He can be aloof and standoffish with strangers, but very affection when he warms up, to the point of being a big goofball! Thunder is a quick learner and knows several commands including sit, down, and spin. He is a very high energy dog and would do best with an experienced, confident owner willing to participate in activities like walking, jogging, and hiking. \n\nThunder can be food aggressive, especially over raw food but he is currently being worked with regarding this. He will need an experienced owner that would know what to expect with him. Routine and consistency is key with Thunder. He was not socialized to other dogs until he arrived at our rescue, and we have noticed he is awkward around other dogs and has problems communicating, but has not shown any real aggression. He requires a fenced in outdoor enclosure that is at least six feet in height. He was raised inside, but would not settle down or relax in the house and get into everything.\n\nPlease no small pets such as small dogs or cats. Thunder is part wolf and will only be adopted to areas where wolfdogs are legal to own. \n\nIf you're interested in Thunder, please read our adoption requirements first at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/adopt_a_wolf_adoption_requirements.html\n\nthen submit an application at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/wolf_adoption_adopt_a_wolf_application.php\n\nor contact us by calling (732) 534-5745\n\nDo not inquire about or apply for Thunder if you live in any the following States: Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine.  Wolfdogs are illegal to possess in these States.\n\n\n\n",

I'm the victim of a new baby and my owners have no time for me and they feel I would be better with a person/couple that will have the time to give me daily interactivity that I am not getting. It's OK, I'm ready to move onto my next adventure and to a QUIET HOME where I can be the \"apple of someone's eye\" I'm just a great golden guy with a huge smile and just love everyone!!. I'm low active and as you can see I'm a bit overweight due to lack of exercise. I love going for walks and rolling in the leaves and to play with toys on my own. In the house I'm easy going, mellow and a couch potato. I'm housebroken and crate trained and am excellent on the leash. My only vice is that I'm a bit \"food funny\" and also like to GUARD MY TOYS so I need someone EXPERIENCED with RESOURCE GUARDING. I am fine with other dogs but am a bit dominant so I would be best with a submissive large dog or tough small dog but of course I would be happiest as your \"one and only\". Unfortunately I'm NOT GOOD with CATS. I'm a great dog for someone that needs a 4 legged Companion to hang with.   Pls come meet me today!\n\nFor more info and app; Pls email: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

            "description": "Maya loves people.  She also needs an experienced handler and must be an only animal.  Maya got herself into trouble chasing (and catching) a neighbor\u2019s chickens.  Sweet and silly, Maya can be protective of \u201cher\u201d people which can be problematic.  With a little training Maya will be a fabulous companion in a household with older children (or no kids).\n\nWill you be her new forever home?\n\nMaya's approx. DOB is 2/1/2014.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted to adoption@pupsquad.org or via the online form. \n\nWe are happy to transport our dogs out-of-state as we have lots of experience doing this and love to see our dogs to the best homes possible! We will assist with the whole process to getting your new pet to you. Feel free to email us regarding availability or any other questions. Please remember all breed estimates are just that...estimations based on our experience. \n\nNOTE: We will only do transport if the dogs are 4 months of age or older as this means they are fully vetted and spay/neutered at this age and ready for transport.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi there, I am Morgana, a 30-pound female Feist/Hound mix, possibly Mountain Cur.  I\u2019m about 6 years old.  I have an old leg injury, most likely from being shot since I do have numerous birdshot showing on X-ray.  I can run and jump similar to other dogs.  I am very playful with people and chew toys.  I love to steal the chew toys from my foster brothers but I don\u2019t really play with my foster brothers.  I have a sense of humor and I am happy most of the time; sometimes I have irritable moments, which might be PTSD.  I cannot be crated and I\u2019m unable to walk up stairs due to knee issues.  I do have accidents if I\u2019m not let out routinely; so before bed and before you leave, you have to make sure I relieve myself.  I love car rides.  My foster parents say I am a perfect little girl despite my few issues.  I love to be hugged, petted, and have my tummy rubbed. So come and see me soon and see if I'm the perfect girl for you.\n \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus. We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step. Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

            "description": "May 2020.   Smokey was one of 21 small dogs rescued way back in November 2009.  FFL took 17 on November 22 of 2009 and acquired the other 4 over the next couple months. 17 of the dogs were sent to Save a Dog rescue in Sudbury, MA, over the following months and were adopted (THANK YOU, SAD!).  Smokey is right around 15 lbs. He's a little long in the back and short in the leg. He's listed as Special Needs because of his lack of socialization (but he would come around pretty quickly if he was with dogs that liked attention from people). He's also Special Needs because he lost an eye in November, no idea what happened, but it could be genetic because Oscar (a possible littermate to Smokey) lost both eyes 2 years ago to the same symptoms, also undetermined as to the cause. ??  Smokey is available for adoption ONLY to a person, couple, or family with at least one other dog that he can buddy with, because he's used to being around other dogs (NO CATS); and he, she, or they must have the patience and the time to work with him AND keep him the rest of his life so he doesn't have to be traumatized by more change.  He's also available as a Sponsor Dog.  Please contact FFL at wvcompanions@yahoo.com or call 304 667-1387 and leave a message if you would like information on becoming a much-needed faithful Sponsor.  This info used to be on FFL's Home Page on Petfinder, but sadly, the Home Page was done away with. FFL finally has a website at friendsforlifewv.org but we're just getting it started.  (NOTE: The picture of the four dogs- Skip, Newt, Oscar and Smokey from left to right- was taken in May of 2011.",

            "description": "MAY 2020:    Oscar (a.k.a. Little O, Oscadoosky) was one of 21 small dogs rescued way back in November 2009. The owner had begun with a male and a female (possible littermates) 4 years prior but had never had them fixed. The other 21 dogs came from those first two, and we assumed that most of the dogs were inbred. Some were obviously not socialized and were feral. Sadly, the owner, who'd been hospitalized, passed away a couple days after the dogs were removed from the home and we weren't able to get any information about the dogs. 17 of the 21 dogs were accepted and placed through Save A Dog rescue in Sudbury, MA, over the next year (THANK YOU, SAD!).  Oscar is around 14 lbs and is listed as Special Needs because he is feral, and now because he has no eyes. Both eyes were removed in Feb 2017.  No infection was seen, and we have no idea what happened. (It may be a genetic thing, because in Nov 2019, Smokey- a littermate or close relative- also developed the same symptoms in his left eye, and after treatment failed, lost that eye.) Oscar has done very well, and gets around well.  He's available for SPONSORSHIP ONLY, because of his age now (possibly 12-15 years), being feral, and his handicap. He's been at FFL for 11 years now.  (NOTE: The picture of the four dogs- Skip, Newt, Oscar and Smokey from left to right- was taken in May of 2011, as was the close-up.) The one of him with the blue E-collar and the flaps over both eyes was taken 02/03/2017 during the treatment before we had to resort to surgery.  The one of his shaved eye area is the day after the surgery to remove the eyes, and the other two (poor quality!) pictures are more recent. He's hard to photograph; he never stops moving and does NOT want to be handled.  Please contact FFL at wvcompanions@yahoo.com or call 304 667-1387 and leave a message if you'd like information on becoming a Sponsor. Thank you!",

            "description": "Skip was one of 21 small dogs rescued way back in November 2009.  The owner had begun with a male and a female (possibly littermates) 4 years prior but had never had them fixed. As a result, all of the 21 were assumed inbred except for the original pair. Skip is one of four males who refused to socialize with people over the years (although they love other dogs), and to this day he still does not want to be touched, petted, or handled in any way. Skip is about 14 lbs. and is listed as Special Needs because of his lack of socialization and his age, which is probably 11-12, possibly even 14 years.  Skip is available for sponsorship only, because of his age. His most recent bloodwork was perfect, he had his teeth cleaned in Feb 2020, and he's in good condition.  (NOTE:  The picture of the four dogs- Skip, Newt, Oscar, and Smokey, from left to right- was taken in May 2011. The primary picture was taken in Nov 2019.)  If you would like information on becoming a Sponsor, please contact FFL at wvcompanions@yahoo.com or call 304 667-1387 and leave a message.  FFL needs Sponsors!",

I am Big Daddys son and I am looking for my forever home.  \nMy Health: I am healthy, although a bit overweight  and should live a long and happy life.\nAbout me and what I need: my previous home was rural. I am doing well on leash. I am crate trained and getting socialized with all sorts of people and other animals. Of course I need to have my training continue so that I will continue  to be a social and friendly dog. \nThe best home for me: I am good with Kids and other calm dogs. The best home for me is one that has the time to care and teach me. I would do best in a place where I can continue to learn and spend as much time with my humans as possible\nDo you want to meet me?\nAll our dogs are in foster homes so if you would like to meet in person, an approved application must be on file. You can fill out our online application at, www.valhallarescue.org. It is on the \"adoption page\" about half way down. If, for whatever reason, you can't access our online application please send an email to adoption@valhallarescue.org and request one be emailed to you.\nAbout Valhalla Rescue:\nWe are a 501(c)3 recognized charity. Our volunteers dedicate all our free hours to our dogs and finding a good match for you, so please be patient with them and our process. \n\nIf you have more questions, please call 360-559-4972.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR SAVING THE LIFE OF A RESCUE DOG",

            "description": "Name: Rex & Rocko\nBreed: American Bully (Rex) & American Pit Bull Terrier/Lab (Rocko)\nAge: Adult\nGender: Males\n\nRex and Rocko, more affectionately known as \u201cThe Boyfriends\u201d, are two best friend bully breed mixes who love each other more than anything in this world.  They may not really be attached at the hip but they sure act like it!  They are seeking a home looking for 2 dogs who already adore each other, get along perfectly, and who are better dogs when they\u2019re together.  While they came into rescue separately-Rocko an owner surrender when his owner went to jail, Rex from a local shelter who didn\u2019t feel he was placeable due to his separation anxiety-they found each other in rescue and instantly became inseparable.  Rocko loves to swim and could spend hours in the pool while Rex is content to lay next to the pool and be the lifeguard. They love to play fetch, though for Rex its not so much fetch as grab the ball and forget to keep it in his mouth on the run back, but Rocko is always happy to pick up the dropped ball and carry it back for his friend.  He\u2019s got Rex\u2019s back after all. They have similar good qualities.  They\u2019re friendly, love people, playful, love to chomp on bones, excellent walking buddies, housetrained, know basic obedience and tricks, and are always down for a good snuggle. They also struggle with separation anxiety.  Separately they struggle far more than when they are together so they actually do make each other better dogs but separation anxiety is an uphill battle that takes patience, consistency, training, and a forever home willing to commit for the long haul and put the time and work in.  They need a home willing to continue to work with them, invest in a sturdy, reinforced crate, and someone who is home more often than not.  We know it is a tall order to find them a home together at all let alone with their separation anxiety but we owe it to them to try to keep this pair together.  These boys have some of the kindest hearts we have ever known.\n\nRequirements: Adopter must own home due to breed mix.  Someone home more often than not, willing to invest in an \"indestructible\" kennel, and will continue training for the separation anxiety.  No cats.\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104540557144\n\nYou can email laurahhk9@gmail.com with questions and for a preadopt application. This dog has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated as age appropriate, tested for heartworm disease if age appropriate, and dewormed.",

She is one of the longest stays in our rescue and recently came back to us from previous adopters due to no fault of her own. Bebe is staffordshire terrier mix and is the perfect age. She is still playful out in the yard and would be a great companion for walks, hikes, etc but she also loves to snuggle! \n\nShe would do best in a home as an only dog and/or a home with another very submissive dogs. She likes to be in control and can be a little dominant. She is a lady after all! She does not do well with cats and would do best in a home with older children. \n\nBebe is up to date on shots, spayed, microchipped and on preventative. She is also HW negative. Bebe is available for meet and greets. We also offer a 2 week trial adoption for potential families.",

I am as sweet as sugar :)  Now can I just tell you I lived with people who didn't believe in getting any of their dogs fixed so by the time I was 6 months old I became and unwed mother;  I have 3 little girls who are adorable and I am very close with my little Laurie as she is the smallest and seems to want to be with me most :)   All my girls are well behaved and my foster mom has promised me they will never have to be teen moms like I was YAY!  I'm gentle and loving and boy do I love my friend Holly!  We came in together and we run like the wind in our foster home back yard.\nMy foster mom is requiring a fence for us so we can have lots of fun running like we like :)  She also says no young kids because I am so small and easily broken;  So no children under the age of 12 and a more laid back home would be awesome!",

Savannah has lived in the same home since she was a puppy, but they recently had to give her up due to some family issues and no fault of her own, so poor Savannah has found herself without a \"fur\"-ever home. Savannah is up to date on vaccines, is Heartworm negative, and spayed. We will cover a microchip for her as well upon adoption. \n\nSavannah's approx. DOB is 3/25/2010.\n\nSavannah has a good amount of energy (that's a Hound/boxer mix for you) and she loves zipping around the yard, so she would probably do best in an medium/active home that can give her lots of love and attention. \n\nShe loves playing with other dogs her own size (or bigger, too). Savannah does tend to have a bit of a prey drive, so smaller dogs or cats could be an issue. \nShe loves dog toys of all kinds. Bones, antlers, and rope toys are great, as they last longer for her! She loves to explore, but is well behaved and at the end of the day lays right down on her dog bed for a snooze. \n\nSavannah is a very sweet girl. She, especially loves getting attention from her humans. She can be a little shy at first when in a new situation, but her confidence is growing and once she warms up to you, she is very loving and just wants to cuddle. She has a very calm, soothing demeanor--she loves to rest her head on her lap and give little kisses. She hardly jumps on her humans, either! \n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted to adoption@pupsquad.org or via the online form. \n\nWe are happy to transport our dogs out-of-state as we have lots of experience doing this and love to see our dogs to the best homes possible! We will assist with the whole process to getting your new pet to you. Feel free to email us regarding availability or any other questions. Please remember all breed estimates are just that...estimations based on our experience. \n\nNOTE: We will only do transport if the dogs are 4 months of age or older as this means they are fully vetted and spay/neutered at this age and ready for transport.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org",

            "description": "Update Rusty is about 5 -1/2 years old 5/2020. Posted 9/16/16 Rusty was picked up as a stray from one shelter and transferred to another, this poor guy was passed around like candy. He is fine with dogs as long as he isn't on a leash. He is crate trained and housebroken. He does have resource guarding issues so we will not place his with any children. He is NOT good with cats. He needs a person that is a little dog savy. Once he gets to know what is expected of him he is a wonderful dog. He is not the type of dog to be around too many strangers he can be a bit afraid. Give him a chance and he will be a great companion. His adoption fee is $175 he weighs about 40lbs and is about a year and a half old. All the dogs are Spayed or Neutered, Heartworm tested, UTD on vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas and overall Vet checked. We offer a 30 day money back guarantee along with an adoption kit . Application REQUIRED. Adoption fee required. If interested contact Denise @ (717) 469-7325 Email: Doggieden@aol.com\nThe FIRST STEP to be considered for adopting a pet is to fill out the adoption application COMPLETELY .Fill Out Adoption Application HereOR thedogsden.rescuegroups.org",

True to my Ridgeback instincts I am also very loyal and very protective of the ones I love, so I will need an adult only, low-traffic home where I will be allowed plenty of time to warm up to strangers. I\u2019m young, active, and when I\u2019m in my playgroup I do love playing with the other dogs almost as much as I hate kitty cats! With proper introductions, I may be able to share my home with the correctly matched dog but going to the dog park is a bit more than I can handle. I am already crate trained and housebroken too \u2013 Sure, I could use a bit more in the training department, but I\u2019m smart, pick up new things really quickly and am super eager to please my person, so that should be fun! I am lacking in the confidence department so a good confidence boost will do wonders for me! This whole rescue business has my head spinnin\u2019, and I can\u2019t tell which way is up! But I promise, you help me find the surface, and I\u2019ll promise you to be the sweetest companion I can.\n\n5 years old-58lbs. My adoption fee is $200 and includes spay, microchip & registration, 1 month pet health insurance, reduced-cost training class, free vet exam, leash/collar, toy & treat packet, food sample.\n\nPLEASE VISIT https://www.familydogsnewlife.org/policies FOR ADOPTION POLICY/PROCEDURAL INFORMATION",

            "description": "Merlin is a 7 year old, 6 pound neutered male Chihuahua. Merlin can be a VERY difficult chihuahua. He has resource guarding issues and is very nervous and untrusting of anyone. Merlin will eventually allow you to exist in his world, but it took months and months for him to allow his foster mom to show him affection, pick him up, and play with him. He is mostly fine with other small dogs in the home. Merlin\u2019s ideal home will be an adult only home with a fenced yard (he will not be easy to harness). His potential family should understand that Merlin will be extremely difficult to acclimate and it will take several months to gain his trust. He is not a snuggly dog and it's likely you will not be able to pick him up, so patience, understanding, and a willingness to not push his boundaries are a MUST!\n\n**Only very experienced and patient dog people should apply - he has significant behavior issues that you cannot \"love away\". You will need to respect his boundaries and be okay working around his terms.**\n\nIf you wish to be considered for this animal, please download an application at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ or email fallstonrescue@aol.com to request one. It can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond. \n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications on one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n",

Ava is willing to learn and very anxious to please people.  She absolutely loves her belly rubbed and ADORES people!\n\n\nAva LOVES children but is listed as 'not a good fit' for children only because with her aggression toward other dogs, it is too risky to have children in the house that may leave a door open or a fence gate. Ava needs a very responsible controlled environment with someone who can keep her safe and protect her.\n\nIf you would like additional information on Ava, please email us at rufftimesrescueadoptions@gmail.com \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Ava, please go to www.rufftimesrescue.org to fill out a pet of interest form. We will get in touch with you to set a good time for you to meet this sweet loving girl!",

            "description": "Trooper is a magnificent fellow, a mixture of German Shepherd and possibly malamute.  He weighs in at about 80 pounds.  He is discriminating in who he bonds with, so he will need time and patience to establish the trust that he needs with his new owner.  \n\nHe walks nicely on the leash and has shown no aggression towards other animals, however, he is not fond of pushy or rough playing dogs.  Trooper is basically a one person dog and would do best with a single individual who prefers a quiet lifestyle without a lot of people coming and going.  He also needs to be the only dog in the household.  \n\nTrooper will guard his home and bark at intruders, therefore, his new owner must be confident and set rules and boundaries for him.  On-going obedience training is required.  He is crate trained, however, he will need some brushing up in that area as well as appropriate behavior.  \n\nGiven time, patience and consistency , he would make a top notch and totally loyal companion.   He does know some basic obedience and his desire to please is very high.  Trooper loves physical attention from his chosen person, he is not \"everybody's\" dog, he reserves his special attention for his selected person\n\n  GEPDA dogs/puppies all come neutered/spayed, micro-chipped, DHPP  shots, a bordetella, and have been de-wormed.  They will have received their first flea treatment before going home.          \n\nWe are located in San Martin, CA and we DO NOT  put on any of our dogs/puppies on transport, or shipped to adopters.        \n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our dogs or puppies please our website at http://gepdaus.org/Adoption1.html and fill out an adoption application and forward it to use with your email to ksrottiesrus@gmail.com.         \n\nadoption/donation fee is $250.00 which will have prepared our dogs and or puppies for adoption and to help other rescued dogs with dire medical needs.        \n\n ***Breed is solely up to the shelter and GEPDA vet.***       \n\n Learn more about us at our (501c3) website at www.gepdaus.org.\n         \nThank you for wanting to save a life!",

            "description": "Billy is a senior and was sadly surrendered with his 'brother', Peppy, to the Arizona Humane Society due to their human entering a care facility.\n\nAHS didn't require that they be pulled together, but given their worlds have recently been turned upside down we thought it was in their best interest to do so. Peppy has since found his forever home, but Billy is still waiting for his perfect family to arrive.\n\nBilly is friendly, housebroken and can use a dog door. He is good with other dogs and supposedly cats but he has not been tested in his foster home. He has been crate trained too. \n\nBilly's foster has been practicing walking on a leash and he is getting better and better by the day. We love his cute little prance when he walks, because it look like he's on a pogo stick.\n\nBilly does well with other dogs but has a habit of rambunctiously grabbing treats from your fingers when they are offered so we'd recommend a forever home with older children.\n\nDuring his time in foster care Billy's foster mom noticed his ear thickening. She took him to the vet and he was diagnosed with an aural hematoma.\n\nAural hematomas often occur when trauma of some sort has happened and the ear respond by filling up with blood. We're not exactly sure how this happened with Billy (maybe he bonked his ear in the doorway coming inside?), but he's fully mended.\n\nNow Billy has one permanent floppy ear, but we think it just adds to his already adorable character!\n\nInterested in learning more about Billy?

Due to her behavior she was slated fo be destroyed at the pound when volunteers got her up to Meade Canine.   \nReyna has a most unusual howl and often sings!!  She is a dog worth getting to know but she has chosen to know us now and is here to stay.  She would fight tooth and nail if we had to move her.\nPS yes, she will insist on sleeping with you and isn't too fond of sharing a lap so to be an only or one of few would be her ideal home. Having said that, She will not be one to leave MCR easily as she has settled in and is difficult to catch..  \n\nAnd she is great with cats!",

            "description": "January 2021--   Maxx is a people-lover!  He's VERY strong and loves to play.  He is kennel trained and does not soil his inside run.  He will sit on command (if you have food) and has learned \"stay\" for his Kong with some kibble in it.  He's figured out he needs to watch the human and not the treat. Good boy!  He's settled down SOME as a senior dog (10 yrs old) but still has plenty of energy, and plenty of exercise will keep him more settled.  He's developed arthritis in his lower back and has been stiff and painful of a morning during cold weather, despite pain medication and a heat pad under his bedding. He's had laser treatments and injections of Adequan in the past and is on joint supplements. This winter he's not been affected by the arthritis for some reason- yay, Maxx! He gets along well with multiple dogs here.  Please, NO cats, rabbits, squirrels, other small animals, birds, snakes, or garden hoses!  He has a very strong prey drive. He also has a thing about water, like some dogs do-- he wants to catch it (we think) -- from the hose, or as it drips off the roof.  He's been known to zip through a group of people and snatch a mitten off a hand, slick as a whistle.....  He was originally brought to Friends for Life in November 2011 when he was 10 months old when his humans had to move and couldn't keep him. Maxx will add lots of life to YOUR life!  Background check, veterinary reference and 3 personal references required.  If you would like to sponsor Maxx, we need sponsors!  Please contact FFL at wvcompanions@yahoo.com or leave a message at 304 667-1387 and someone will return your call.",

He will hide in your home ..one of our fosters lost him and he was hiding under her deck outside..we are scared for him to go anywhere unless you can commit to keeping him on a leash most of the time until he knows he he is home.\u00a0 This would be after we have a approved application and home check. We should have named him frozen... he freezes when u pet him or pick him up.\u00a0 His buddy was adopted and we feel he needs another dog as he likes other dogs to help him gain the confidence he so needs.\u00a0 If your in a certain area we have a trainer to send to your home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bonnie and her friend Clyde were playmates before he moved on, so she is ready for the companionship of her own family.\n\nBonnie is only available to meet at the Home At Last grounds in Godley.\n\nSee www.halah.org for more information and photos.

He is as sweet as can with every person he meets and would make a wonderful family dog. \n\nHe does not get along well with other dogs, and we think he would thrive most as the only dog in a household.  He will need at least a 5-foot cyclone fence or wooden fence if kept outside unattended. Buster is crate trained and knows basic commands. Buster is a really loyal, active, sweet, and smart dog. He would be a great running partner! \n\nHe has all his necessary vaccinations, is microchipped, and is neutered. As of 2020, He is around 6 years old.",

People were not committed nor prepared for a strong dog that needs consistency.\nHe's been in Rescue longer than with anyone.\n\nHe is funny, silly, stubborn, playful and loving. Not big on strangers without introductions and due to being teased by children we are saying no kids unless under strict supervision.\nHe's still a puppy and doesn't always know his strength.\nHe\u2019s 4 years old, knows some commands, walks well with a training collar and just wants to belong and feel safe.\nRural home only, fenced yard is required and knowledgeable Big Dog owner. Has done OK with cats, not been around small dogs. Does pretty well with other large dogs that aren\u2019t pushy. \nSuper companion in the right home and hands.\nEmail alterupet@aol.com with your qualifications and background.\nPlease don\u2019t inquire unless the above criteria is met.",

            "description": "PRINCESS came into our program on 2/14/16. She came with her own \u201cFairy Tale\u201d story that we know will have a \u201clives happily ever after\u201d ending.\nLast December her owner was murdered and she was given to a neighbor to care for in hopes that a relative of her owner would come for her. When no one came for her, the neighbors called animal control to pick her up. She had been waiting at the shelter for several weeks before we were contacted. During that time several of the staff members became attached and worried about her future, as she is blind. We did not hesitate to take her, as we know that we will find that perfect home for her.\nWe don\u2019t know much about her, other than her owner was a man, and she was hit by a car when she was a puppy which, we are told, caused her blindness. One eye was ruptured and the other has a detached retina. She is approximately a year old, and we are guessing that she may be a Sheltie mix of sorts. We immediately took her to a veterinarian, where it was decided to take out the ruptured eye and spay her at the same time. She is pictured here 3 days after her surgeries.\nWe do know that she must have been very loved by her owner. She will jump up when you go to pick her up. She loves to be held like a baby and hugs you tightly with her head. She is also not a dog to pity, as she is very self-confident and once she knows the area, you would never know that she is blind. She does, however, need a special home that understands how to be her guide dog in strange places, and her limitations, as she doesn\u2019t want to admit she has any. We are still learning about this little girl, who is about 15 lbs. Princess is in a foster home in Wichita, Kansas and will not be shipped. Requirements to adopt Princess are as follows: Her adopter will have to be in the Wichita Metro area or surrounding area; no out-of-state adopters because we need to do a home visit. A secure fenced yard is a must; invisible fences not acceptable. A veterinarian reference is required showing that your present/past pets are up-to-date on shots, spayed/neutered and on heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $200.00. For information on how to apply to adopt Princess, please go to our website www.palsrescue.org",

We have her listed so that we can share her story and perhaps find someone that will understand her needs and have the patience to see her become a wonderful companion dog. There is always hope.\n \nI am her foster mom.  She is timid and fearful and although she allows me to touch and pet her, she is a very special case.  She is currently fostered outside in a large dog pen and has run of my backyard at night. I often have other foster dogs and cats/kittens so it is always a busy time for taking care of everyone.  She loves her dog house and comes out sometimes when called. \n\nShe was trapped on the property of a school in Homestead.  We rescued her pups and then trapped her.  She had serious mastitis and needed surgery.  This was 2.5 years ago.  We had a couple of trainers come to my house and work with her.  She does not like the leash although she was able to run alongside a trainer on a bike ride. She loves cheese.  \n\nShe has never been fostered inside of a house, though we do think that would change her perception of life.  We have just never found a foster that would accommodate her special personality and be able to spend the time that she needs.  Rainbow has been around my dogs and she has never been assertive or aggressive. She does sometimes bark at the dog next door through the fence.\n \nRainbow weighs about 60 lbs.  She eats well and probably doesn\u2019t get enough exercise.  She is probably about 6/7 years old.\n \nRainbow is not your typical dog.  We do still keep hope in our hearts that someone will come along that will devote time and care to her so she can be the dog that she was born to be.  If you would rather have a dog that is already trusting and ready for adoption, we have others.  \n\nPLEASE SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR DOG!  EMAIL US FOR FREE OR LOW COST RESOURCES.\n\nDonations help us to continue rescuing dogs and cats and helping to make sure that they are healthy and properly socialized before being adopted.Thank you for considering a rescued dog/cat from This Is The Dog!. To donate www.thisisthedog.org\nFollow us on Facebook www.facebook.com/thisisthedog \n\nADOPTION PROCESS:\n1. Email adopt@thisisthedog.org for an application.  Complete Adoption Application and return to us at adopt@thisisthedog.org or fax to 305-247-9127\n\n2. Meet with the dog or cat. Bring treats/toys if you would like.\n\n3. If adoption is approved - Complete Adoption Contract\n\nAdoption Donation - $85 for cats and $200 for dogs.\nOut of state cat adoptions are $150 Two for $200\nOut of state dog adoptions $300\nPure breed dog adoptions $500\n\nAll donations are tax deductible.\n\nAdoption donation for dogs includes Spay/Neuter, Up to Date Vaccines, Microchip,  Deworming, and Heartworm Check if needed.  \nAdoption donation for cats/kittens includes Spay/Neuter, Up to Date Vaccines, Deworming, FeLV/FIV testing and Microchip\n\nThank you! This is the Dog! does not have a shelter. Our dogs and cats are in foster homes primarily in Homestead, FL. We are a small group of volunteers making a difference in the lives of people and the dogs/cats that we help. \n\nTOUCH a SOUL.  CHANGE a LIFE.  PERHAPS your OWN.\n\nFREE spay/neuter email adopt@thisisthedog.org\n\nThis is the Dog! (TITD!) makes no representation, warranty or guarantee about an animal\u2019s breed, temperament or behavior. We also make no representation, warranty, or guarantee as to the size at maturity, health or disposition of any dog because This is the Dog!  is  uncertain of its background or \nhistory.

Once he is picked up we will remove his profile. Please do not write to us for an application. Sorry for any inconvenience.\n\n\nMax is a delightful little guy whose goofy grin and wildly wagging tail get a smile from everyone he meets!  He is housetrained and good with other dogs and cats who are tolerant of dogs.  \n\nMax is about 1-1/2 to 2 years old and about 7 lbs. He is an affectionate, sweet boy. He has blossomed in foster care and has overcome most of his initial shyness at meeting new people. Max thrives in the company of other dogs. He has become play pals with a gentle Aussie and is currently in a foster home with two small dogs. Max has met several horses and was also good with them. \n\nHe would also do well with younger children as long as they treated him gently.    Max absolutely loves his walks! He becomes so excited when he knows that he is going for a walk that he dances on his hind legs (he does the same at meal time!). He has boundless energy while on walks and is well-behaved on the leash.   \n\nAt home, Max is a calm and happy dog who loves to cuddle. He'll win your heart when he climbs into your lap and takes a nap while you watch TV. He does not seem interested in playing with toys. He does like to sleep with his person at night and sleeps through the night with no problem.   \n\nMax would do best in a home with another dog (or dogs) or if his person were with him much of the time. He is a special little guy who deserves a stable and loving long-term home.\n\nMax\u2019s adoption fee is $275. He is being fostered in Martinez, CA.\n\nArrangements to meet our dogs occur after an application has been received.\n\nPlease contact us at dogzonerescue@yahoo.com for more information about this great guy or for an application to adopt.",

            "description": "Pearl is a determined spunky little girl with a mind of her own.  She is learning to trust and that she can be safe around people, and it has been amazing to watch her change.  She is affectionate, goofy and very sweet.   She would do well with a patient adult-only family that has another dog (she loves to play with other dogs!) that will keep helping her build up her confidence and be the best dog she can be.  She promises to love you back forever if given that chance.\n\nWhen I first met her, she was so shy she would not let me take her for a walk. After a little while, she decided I was safe enough to hang out with, so she sat down on the grass next to me, but always keeping the shelter door in her sight.  Great improvement!  Pearl was relaxing a bit and then I realized she was silently TALKING!  You see, when Pearl wants something, she sits and is pointing at it.  Very polite of her! So, we sat like that for a while, chatting, just us girls\u2026 Pearl telling me she wanted to go back inside, me telling her it was ok to be outside.  It took a couple of tries and some sweet talk, and she finally let me walk her to the end of the road. Now we stroll around town - you might have seen her fashionably walking up and down Main Street with EXTREMELY good leash manners for the little shy dog that she is. Pearl is around 5 years old.\n",

My name is Max! I like movies, romantic dinners, and long walks on the beach -- just kidding, this isn't a dating ad. But, I am looking for my forever home!\n\n I love hanging out with my humans. I like going for walks, hiking, riding in the car, and sitting in your lap. Don't let my size fool you, I am a lap dog and love to cuddle. I like playing with other dog friends and with older children that like to play outside and give me toys. I'm not that fond of babies, however. They are a little too needy and take up too much space. Other than that, I'm pretty easy going and am very smart. I know all of my basic commands and am pretty obedient.\n\n So now that you know more about me, are you ready to go on that first date? Gotcha again! Let's go home and play!\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

He's okay with other dogs but we feel he would be best being the only animal in the home. \n\nSaylor has lots of energy and loves to run and play, he would make a perfect running partner.  He adores attention from his human, he is so happy cuddling and gives the best hugs ever! Saylor also did well in basic training classes and has learned sit, down, stay, touch, and how to walk by your side. He's a smart boy that is eager to please.\n\nSaylor is about 6 years old, 55 pounds, neutered, and up to date on shots.

Addison's disease can be serious illness BUT dogs who have it do respond well to treatment,and can live normal, healthy, long lives. Shea is now 8 years old and has had Addison's since before he was surrendered to us. \nBesides his illness and his aversion to cats, Shea is a wonderful companion and a terrific family pet. He welcomes all other dogs into his home and loves people, even strangers. He glides along on a leash and loves his walks. Even though a calm home is helpful for his condition, car rides, snuggling, children, and performing tricks are also high on his list of enjoyable activities. \n\n\nADOPTION FEE:$150\n\nFollow this link to our online application\nhttps://rawhiderescue.org/?page_id=13\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION DOCUMENT THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.pdf\n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n http://www.rawhiderescue.org",

            "description": "My name is Moose! I am a 9 year old Black Shepherd/ Pit Bull Mix. I am a big guy with a big heart! I'm a little shy and \"barky\" upon meeting new people, but once I warm up, I love to roll over for belly rubs. This part of my personality also makes me one amazing guard dog. I also get along great with kids and other dogs, especially female ones, and I love treats of any kind and getting attention! I'm a mellow guy and don't require a lot of exercise, and am perfectly happy to just be with my people. \n\nI am unfortunately allergic to many things including grass. I would do best in a house with mostly concrete. I do like to play ball, so that would be cool also.\n\nI was found as a stray under a freeway over pass by the All Paws Rescue's founder who just couldn't leave me behind. I've been waiting for my forever family for quite awhile now, and would love to find a forever family of my own. Please ask to meet me because I'm sure once you get to know me, you will fall in love with me.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting me, please go to our website and fill out an adoption application. I am currently being fostered in Chino, CA. My adoption fee is $150. http://www.allpawsrescue-rehab.org/#!adoptable-dogs/c1hor",

He was very confused and scared, and in lots of pain. After a week of intensive care and orthopedic surgery, he came home to Molino de Suenos. He is now fully recovered and this is what Buddy has to say...\n\nHi my name is buddy and Im a spunky little guy. Ive been through so much, I even have plates in back. But that's all in the past and now Im looking for my forever home. You may not be able to tell from the picture but I have beautiful green eyes and I also get along great with everyone.

Dogs with megaesophagus have a dilated esophagus due to lack of muscle tone, which causes food to sit in the esophagus rather than travel to the stomach. As a result, it is not unusual for her to regurgitate.  She is on a structured feeding routine and eats in a Bailey Chair. In spite of this, Clementine is an otherwise \u2018normal' dog. She is very friendly with everyone \u2013 including other dogs and cats \u2013 and especially loves children. She is housebroken and crate trained. Clem\u2019s megaesophagus will be a lifelong medical condition that will need continued monitoring.  She is an incredibly sweet dog and would love to be part of a family.",

She is not destructive, does not jump up and doesn't bark unless there is something to bark about.  Peg came to us from a situation where she was used fro breeding purposes and her needs and comfort were not met.  Upon arrival she was very distrustful and frightened of our volunteers, shrinking in the back of her kennel.  She was not aggressive toward us but  unsure about us.  We worked with her daily to gain her trust and day by day she has responded.  For the first time in her life she has enjoyed playing with balls, squeaky toys, tummy rubs and the affection of humans.  She now greets us with her tail wagging eager to get out for potty and play time.  She is still cautious with strangers but warms up quickly.  Peg has come so far and it has been heartwarming to watch her bloom.  She will make someone a wonderful, loyal companion.  She will need a patient owner who will allow time for bonding.",

Andromeda and her sister  Artemis were rescued from a home where they were kept in a basement closet with minimal light, minimal exposure, and minimal socialization. \n\nShe is thriving in her foster home and is doing well. She lives with older kids, and dogs. She is very playful, and enjoys someone who is heedful. She is crate trained and housebroken.  She is mouthy and would need someone who can work with her and provide structured guidance to maintain safety for herself and to others. Not recommended for a home with children. Experience with the bully breed required. \n\nEmail harescue1@aol.com or haar13@aol.com You can fill out our application at the link below by copying entire link and pasting it into the search engine that you use: http://fs30.formsite.com/HAARescue/AdoptionApplication/index.html",

Puncher had been starved, had very little fur and it appears duct tape was used to tape his mouth shut. Those days are long gone, though, and now he is a very happy-go-lucky boy. Puncher can be playful, is quite the ladies' man (female dogs love him & vice versa) and once you're in his circle, he'll protect you with his life if danger is sensed.  He is not handsome in the traditional sense but his beauty lies in his confidence and ability to make people smile in clowning around. Puncher is neutered, up to-date on vaccines and microchipped. A forever family would make his life be what every dog's should be about...could that be you?",

She was taken to the shelter where they put her on the EU list. \n\nWe came and got her and took her straight to the vet for care. Her pelvis is healing very nicely and she will be spayed in the coming weeks.\n\nIris is current on all her shots and has been chipped. She is good with other dogs as we have seen with her foster.\nIris is full of energy and feeling good.\n She is in great spirits and is a happy girl. \n\nIris is approx 3 yr old and still a puppy that will need a strong handler because she is a strong girl.  She loves her toys and loves belly rubs.\n\nShe is currently in the DFW area so if you are interested in her, please fill out our application. A home check and vet check is required. \n\nHer perfect home will have a 6' fenced in yard as she can jump a 4' fence and no cats.\n\nWill you be her forever home?\nPlease ask about Iris when you contact Blue Angel Weimaraner Rescue of Texas. \n\nFor donations, please send via paypal to: blueangelweims@att.net Phone: (469) 844-0425 www.blueangelweimaranerrescueoftexas.org.

This probably means that somebody missed the mark dropping him off at HUA. Bumper is such a nice young man. He possesses a talent the likes of which we have never seen - he crosses his ears. It is really something else and of course gets us laughing. Bumper loves to make us happy, so the ear crossing is a big deal and he performs this trick often. Bumper still has some puppy left in him and loves to climb and explore, so a secure, fenced-in yard is a must for him. He gets along so nicely with the other dogs and adores all humans. Bumper will be a great addition for an active family.",

Daisy was surrendered back to us as the family had to move and it was disclosed at the time that a member of the family had abused Daisy. It was a male so she is wary of men at first. \n\nWe are guessing there is Beagle and Foxhound in her background.  Daisy weighs about 35 pounds and is about 4 years old.  She prefers females but warms up to men who are patient and she is not suitable in a home with children.  She needs a nice big FENCED yard because she likes to run. Daisy is good with most dogs when properly introduced. She needs a patient adopter that will take it slow and earn her trust. Maybe come out and visit her a few times to let her learn who you are, then maybe work from there. Nothing worthwhile ever comes easy. And Daisy is a doll and quite the character once you are in her circle. Hot dogs help! \n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180.  This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you have questions about an animal, please complete an adoption application at sqrescueinc.org  FIRST.  Someone will reach out to you once you are approved and be able to answer all your questions. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs. Missing or incomplete information will delay processing of applications.  For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nWe have a special angels for SissyGirl!!!  Concetta Fisher and Elizabeth Ashe!!  SCMR thanks you and so does SissyGirl.\n\n\n\nUpdate Sept. 2018\n\nSissyGirl is still sweet as can be, but her physical condition is deteriorating. She has a form of myelopathy which is causing her to lose the use of her back legs. She has to be carried outside several times a day to potty. Otherwise, she lounges on a pee pad in her favorite bed where she can see everyone and what all is going on.  \n\nShe's still very interested in all the activity around her. She used to be very enthusiastic about her food, but her lack of activity may have affected her appetite. She has to be spoon fed like a baby now. She will eat as long as it's soupy, and she is well nourished with good bowel function.  \n\nWe believe this little angel is in her twilight. It might depress her to have to relocate as she nears the end of life stage, and she could continue to live for a long time interested in all around her. Also, her physical disability might affect her negatively...we don't know.  \n\nMost people aren't interested in adopting a hospice dog, and that is understandable. However, you can help by becoming a sponsor for SissyGirl and helping us pay for her ongoing care. Please become one of SissyGirl's Angels now, and help us help her!\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

She smiles -- so cute.  \n\n  Roxy loves the park, swimming, and desert walks. She's very friendly and likes people, dogs, and children. She plays fetch and loves tennis balls, toys, and shredding things (put your shoes away!).  \n\n  Due to Roxy's physical strength and lack of leash training, she needs a strong, active owner who will help her with further training. She knows basic commands (come, no, sit) but she often ignores them if she is distracted.  \n\n  Roxy is beginning to understand \"stay, heel, no bark, and stop\" but needs additional training. Roxy has a tendency to happily bark as people walk by, and we are currently working on that. She responds very well to positive reinforcement, such as \"Good girl, no bark!\" as she very much wants to please.  \n\n  Roxy may display protective reactions around the home area and is a good watchdog. She has learned a lot in short period of time, wants to be where you are and is a  good friend and companion! \n\n  Due to obesity, Roxy 5  requires strict  diet, thyroid medication,  and exercise daily. \n\n \n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

I'm looking for a home with a consistent schedule, snacks, a place to do zoomiez, and daily snuggle time. I really enjoy walks and car rides! I\u2019d prefer if your hobbies included sharing your dinner, but we can negotiate further after I\u2019ve made myself comfortable. I\u2019m not much for commands, but I get the jist. I will sit, snuggle and kiss on command.  Sometimes I can even catch things thrown at my face! I love toys, especially the squeaky ones. I also love visits from human friends! If you're away from the house for over 6 hours a dog walker is a great option for me. I\u2019m an amazing companion that will keep you entertained with my goofy personality! I need to be the only animal in the home, no exceptions. I like kids, but living with them will overstimulate me and I get too grabby with toys so a quieter household is needed to set me up for success. I require adopters own their home and have a fenced yard.  You can check me out on Facebook! facebook.com/gruntygoober  My adoption fee is $150.00\n\n\n\n",

He is a great dog, very playful, loves to be petted, house trained, crate trained, gets along well with all female dogs.  He is a bit choosy about his male dog friends, but as you can see from his photos, he gets along with some male dogs.  Opie was brought to us because his previous owners could not keep him when they moved into an apartment.  That blasted insurance stuff again.  \n\nIf you'd like to meet Opie please contact us and we'll set up a meeting.",

She even escaped one of her first nights here but was back the next day as she realized this is as good as it gets right now. She is mostly black with a white chest/toes; one blue eye and one brown eye.  Winnie is not approachable. If there is anyone who could come and visit her a few times a week with meat treats/ cheeseburgers, and spend time with her, she could learn to trust. It would take a fairly long term commitment, but she is a gentle soul who could bloom with some attention. \n\nFor an adoption form write a note to pintler_petsmt@yahoo.com.\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.",

Thank you.\n\nTripod Tinker Bell was rescued by a Good Samaritan, Nelly in June 2015 from a very bad situation. She was starved and emaciated at that time, and eventually had to have her back left leg amputated due to severe neglect by her previous owner.  Ms. Tinker Bell does not see herself as a handicapped furry however, as she still gets around perfectly fine.  In fact, being a very happy tripod has actually gotten her extra love and attention by everyone she meets which she always enjoys!  Tinker Bell is a sunny and cheery girl who's smile is contagious.\n\nTinker Bell is approx. 3 years old with beautiful green eyes, has 1 amputated leg, spayed, current on vaccinations, not microchipped, 45 pounds, housetrained and crate trained.  She adores people and kids but is dog selective so a proper meet and greet is needed. She is healthy as a bug, loves car rides and walks, and to play with squeaky toys.  Tinker Bell is a jumper...yes, even as a tripod!... so an 8' fence is a requirement but doesn't have any bad habits like barking, chewing or digging.  Any chance she gets, she'll want to snuggle up to you and give tons of affection and kisses. \n\nIf you think Tinker Bell will be a perfect fit within your family and would like to meet her in person, or have any other questions about her, please contact Nelly at hon3y24@hotmail.com or via phone at 323-503-6402.  Thank you.",

Supposedly poor Mutt Mutt was tied to a tree and mistreated by people and children.  To this day Mutt Mutt is extremely afraid of strangers and needs time, love and understanding before she trusts a new person.  Once she knows and trusts someone, she is the most loving and affectionate dog, always ready for a belly rub or tug-o-war. She is potty trained and knows how to use a doggy door,  Once properly introduced she gets along great with other dogs.  She truly will bring love and fun into the life of whomever adopts her, but does need an experienced dog person because of her mistrust of strangers.\n\nShe is now about 5 years old and  about 50-55 pounds.  She is spayed, micro chipped and up to date with her shots.\n\nPlease call 661-724-0642 if you want to meet her.",

My rescue mom always tells everybody I was like an intruder- but, the good kind! Hence my name, Trudy! \n\nTo be honest, I was just so happy to have someone notice me. I\u2019d been running the streets and I was getting worried & more scared by the day. I found it really hard to be alone with nowhere to feel safe. But, anyway...\n\nI am an 80 pound Doberman mix. I\u2019m a lot of fun & full of energy! I really love walks & could play all day- if it\u2019s with you or other fun dogs! But, I want you to know that I\u2019m great at vegging-out on the couch on a lazy weekend, too. The thing is, I need someone or a whole family to do these things with. Seriously, you\u2019d never look back as soon as I come into your life! \u201cWhat was our life even like before Trudy?!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019re some of Trudy's attributes:\n-- Doggie door trained\n-- Leash trained\n-- Loves riding in the car\n-- Highly curious \n-- Always interested in doing & seeing new things. \n-- Enjoys being outside in the yard, but needs a good fence because I like to go visiting - given half a chance! \n-- Great with people, including children that have good doggie manners. \n-- Favorite thing to do- be anywhere the family is! \n-- I must be an indoor dog & I\u2019m good at it!\n-- Loves dogs! Cats- not so much. \n-- Not to brag, but I\u2019ve been told I have a beautiful face & a sweet disposition. \n\n\u2022 To help us ensure the best forever match between our rescues and adopters, we require the following:\n-- complete & submit an adoption application.\n-- compatibility testing to ensure the applicant's pets get along with our rescue.\n-- home visits conducted prior to all adoptions.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a special friend to share your home & life with, Trudy would love to be your girl. She\u2019d be your best girl-for sure! \n\n\u2022 Please call Phyllis at 405-826-2917 or call or text Sherry at 405-641-7831.\n\nSaving Pets at Risk can\u2019t wait for you to meet Trudy! She needs you.",

This enables us to understand their behaviors more clearly and help match them with the appropriate family, so the adoption will be a forever, happy and successful placement. We focus on educating our adopters and the community about spaying and neutering of animals, and why it is so critical for the healthy life of animals, as well as to help reduce the number of animals that are euthanized daily. We specialize in Chihuahuas and Chihuahua Mixes. \nCheck out our website and fill out an application to foster.\nhttp://www.limbochihuahuas.org/\n\nphoto credit: rchumanesociety.org.",

            "description": "Tracy is a very sweet, happy, female Boston Terrier/AmStaff mix.  She is approx. 12 years old, weighs about 45 pounds, is short & stocky, and has adorable ears that flop over when she perks them up.  She loves to go on leisurely walks and sniff all the interesting scents.  She walks well on a lead, but at times can pull a little bit.  She loves to cuddle and have her ears scratched, but prefers not to share her human(s) with other dogs, so she sometimes gets jealous if her canine housemates try to encroach on her cuddle time.  She would be fine as an only dog or living in a home with other calm dogs (more assertive dogs can make her a little bit snippy).\n\nTracy is a lower energy gal who loves Nylabones and would much rather snooze on a comfy sofa or dog bed, than play with other dogs!  She is afraid of storms and fireworks, and hasn\u2019t been cat tested so we're not sure if she can live in a home with cats.  She does not currently live in a foster home with children, but she likes when kids pet her at adoption events.  Tracy is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated, And microchipped. \n\nIf you have additional questions about Tracy, please email us at info@barkvilledogresscue.org.  If you'd like to adopt Tracy, please submit an adoption application at www.barkvilledogrescue.org.",

Caleb is looking for a home as an only dog with no cats or kids. He is a high energy boy who would enjoy a fenced yard with regular walks and playtime. He rarely barks & walks well on a leash, but can be fearful and skittish towards new people & places.  He startles easily, but is quiet and well mannered indoors. He loves to hide his toys and will thrive with a person who is firm but calm. He is a sweet, smart dog who responds well to training and learns fast. His foster mom is working with him to overcome his fearfulness and he is making slow but steady progress.\n\nFor more information about Caleb, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

Her favorite things to do are entertain people, snuggle, and play with her toys, but she is a dominant female with a high prey drive & doesn't particularly care for other dogs, so an only dog home with no cats or other animals is required.  She loves to be outside, and is strong & active, so she needs an experienced, dog savvy person/family to exercise her, enforce good leash manners, and drain her energy daily.  She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.\n\nFor more information about Scarlett, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

            "description": "Queenie is a spectacular pet in need of a home experienced with German Shepherds.   5-6 years old in age, she is a protective girl who is not very stranger tolerant, so the meet-and-greet procedure with her must be more drawn out and she belongs only in a home comfortable with not allowing strangers to make direct contact with their dog.  Other than that, she is pretty close to perfect.  She can be in public settings where strangers are respectfully hands off.  Approximately four years old, she was pulled from a high kill shelter in Texas heavily pregnant and successfully raised a litter of puppies while being a wonderful mom.  She is now ready to move onto a forever ending of her own :)  She is purebred, although her ears did fail to stand, and a real deal GSD.   She is GREAT company - very playful, joyful and extremely affectionate.  If a German Shepherd can be merry, that would be her.  She is highly intelligent (both the good and the bad....she is an escape artist who can range from smart to daring), very responsible, forms a strong bond, and is an energetic girl with an extremely playful and fun personality.   For the breed, she is not a noisy dog, does great with other dogs, and is ok around cats. Older children only, please, as toddlers make her nervous.  \n\nTHE RIGHT HOME for Queenie needs to have breed experience.  Queenie is territorial and protective by her nature.  When displaced, she forms a strong bond, but meet-and-greets will require patience and understanding as she is not receptive to strangers.  This is a higher energy girl who belongs with someone active.  She crates well and is overall a good housedog, but if bored and under stimulated will be destructive.  She will do fine in a home with another  dog and has learned not to bother cats, but she should not be around smaller children - they are very foreign to her and she finds their movements unsettling.  If you need a dog who can thrive in social settings, she is not the dog for you as while she can be socialized better with strangers, her social circle being an elite group of knowns is inherent to both her and the breed itself.  If, however, you seek a adventurous companion, up for anything, who bonds strongly and is extremely loyal, she could be the dog for you.\n\nApplications are available via contacting Lucy at maramuser@gmail.com.  Her adoption fee is $450.\n",

Unable to find owners, this happy boy is looking for a new home. We think Bosley it around 6 years old. This boy is a stout bully not sure what he is mixed with but he loves people and wags his tail and anyone he meets.  He thinks he is a lap dog but unfortunately we didn't have boarding and had to live at sanctuary for a couple of years. Now he is back and in a foster home with children. We would prefer a home with no other pets since this boy deserves to be spoiled rotten since he has waited so long for a home of his own. If you would like to meet this sweet bully please contact Animal Network at AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com.",

He would make a great pet for a home with no cats and older kids. He's energetic and happy and everyone that sees him comments on how handsome he is. He likes to go on hikes and I take him on daily runs with my bike. He's friendly with everyone we meet and I've never seen him aggressive even with his food or toys. He's big and strong, but he's a big baby.\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

I love riding in the car. I also like to run, play with toys and go for walks but im also happy to follow you around the house and chill. Im a really good boy and i know basic commands. My favorite toy is a big red tug ball and a squeaky heart. Unfortunately I do not do well with other dogs so I must be the only pet. I love giving lots of kisses and being snuggled. \nI do need a large fenced yard. \nWould love a pool or lake. \nGreat dog for a large piece of property in the country. \nNo HOA neighborhoods \n",

He had so little fur a few of us nicknamed him \u201cHairy\u201d. He spent many months on medicine to get better. Thankfully he has made a full recovery and has now been waiting for the perfect family for him.\nCeasar is a big boy with a big energy level and great athletic ability. But he\u2019s not just a jock he is a smart boy too. He is very treat and food motivated which means you can teach him anything. \n\nMore information please email our adoption coordinator or stop out and meet Ceasar today! \n\nIf you are interested, please fill out an application at the link below:\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/acoofohio/form3/index.html\n\n*Animal Charity cannot guarantee the purity in breed of each dog. Therefore, all of our dogs are considered mixed breeds.",

Menchie can be dog selective and seems to have a high prey drive so we don't bother testing her with cats. She can be relaxed in most situations yet playful when you rile her up.

She was part of a cruelty case when a dozen dogs were discovered in the woods tied to trees, with no food or water.  All of the dogs at that location had their ears hacked off, clearly not by a vet.  Demi was also heartworm positive. \n\nDemi is currently on medication for her heartworm, which we will provide to her new family.  Demi gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home, but is, naturally a bit shy, which is why we recommend a home without small children. She will need a patient family, like her foster family, who has done miracles bringing her out of her shell. \n\nIf you would like to make Demi part of your family, please go to:  https://goo.gl/forms/PkzEp1Id67UG1mDl2 and complete an online application to adopt.  Remember, reference checks and home visits apply to all Im-Paws-Able dogs, but especially to special girls like Demi!!!",

She is not a fan of other dogs or them of her. Sadie loves going on walks and playing ball. \n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application. We do adopt out of state and will arrange transports. Our dogs are not allowed to fly cargo at any time.",

Because of his previous life, Harrison is afraid of teenage and adult males. In time though, he has bonded with male Volunteers who took time to allow him to slowly gain his trust.  He does get along great with most dogs, he is well mannered and loves to snuggle. He is house trained and sweet but no cats please. \n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FROM OUR WEBSITE: www.hoperescues.com.  Our adoption fee is $225.00 for all our dogs. \nThis fee includes: Spay/Neuter, microchip, all current vaccinations, and flea/tick treatment. Our dogs are also given monthly heart worm medication in our care.\nDisclaimer: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of our dogs, we are only guessing at breed mix.

I live to play ball - got any baseball or softball in your background? Belly rubs & snuggles are appreciated after a hard day's work. I get along just fine with both dogs and people. So here I am, hoping to find my forever home soon - do you think you might be the ones I'm waiting for???This dog can only be adopted in the DC Metro area.",

Luckily, he was taken in and provided with food and a warm bed. Albert was grateful and quickly took to his rescuer. Albert is now waiting for a forever home and hopes to find one before the holidays this year!\nAlbert is learning his manners. He is doing pretty well for a pup who isn't used to following anyone else's rules! He can sit and walk well on the leash. Albert will do pretty much anything for a treat. Albert is a little insecure and takes some warming up to new people. Who can blame him, being treated poorly and left alone. Nobody had ever given Albert a reason to trust them and he is trying to learn how to feel safe with people. Once he feels safe, he is a most loyal companion!\nGive this beautiful pup reason to smile again, be himself again, be free of fear and worry, and live the life meant for a dog as amazing as him\n\nAlbert is available for private party adoption through his respective owner. Saving Grace Pit Bull Rescue (SGPBR) is assisting in helping his owner find an adoptive home by listing him here. His owner does not represent SGPBR. Albert is not owned by or associated with SGPBR, including SGPBR's adoption and foster programs. SGPBR has not evaluated Albert and makes no claims regarding temperament/disposition and behavior. All information provided is from the owner. SGPBR has not generated or substantiated any information above. SGPBR does verify that all dogs in the courtesy listing program are current on vaccinations and spayed/neutered. \n\nIf you are interested in Albert, we can put you in direct contact with the owner directly for additional information. You may utilize SGPBR's online adoption application as a guideline/tool for providing information to the owner, but all inquiries should go through the dog's owner directly. If you choose to use Saving Grace's application, Saving Grace will foward your application submission to the owner. Thanks!",

Whatever their breed, one thing is for sure they are smart, playful and fun.  He and Marla came to us with their mother and their 8 siblings when they were 12 weeks old.  So basically these wonderful dogs have grown up in our rescue and together and we could not bare to separate them.  Malone absolutely adores children, if you ask her kids are his favorite for sure.  She plays wonderful with other dogs as well as cats. He warms up quicker to new people compared to Marla and he really is a support system for her.  Malone is crate and potty trained to a doggie door.  It would be best for them to go to home with a fenced in yard.\n\nIf you are interested in adding Marla and Malone to your family, please go to www.hcwdogrescue.com and complete an application.\n\n*Adoption Fee*\n$200.00 includes the following:  spay, parasite free, rabies vaccination, DHLPP vaccination, Bordetella vaccination, microchip, heartworm negative and current on prevention.\n\nThanks for choosing adoption",

He likes other dogs but can be a little pushy, so we recommend a passive dog. Unknown how he reacts around cats.. Loves to play with his dog siblings, and is learning to play with toys. Needs someone who is willing to work with him to help him get past his anxiety and fears, a calm home is the best. He was born in August of 2015. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heartworm preventative, heartworm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

She really is wonderful and every time we think we couldn't love her more, she looks at us with that goofy smile and we just melt.\n\nGypsy is a 2.5 year old Pit Bull mix, is spayed, UTD on shots and micro chipped. She gets along great with dogs but a meet and greet is a must. However, she does not want to share her home with cats or small kids.\n\nIf you are meant for her, please come to the AWSOM shelter in Stroudsburg, PA, any day, from 11-4. Gypsy is a work in progress...but aren't we all?!\n\nAge of Dog: Approx. 2.5 years\n\nAll of our adult dogs at AWSOM are spayed or neutered and fully vaccinated prior to adoption. AWSOM will pay for puppies to be spayed and neutered when they are old enough and that is covered by our adoption fee. We will honestly represent our animals to the public. We welcome you to come to our facility to meet our dogs. Thank you so very much for thinking adoption. If you would like to meet this pet or get more information, please visit http://www.awsomanimals.org/adoptablepets/adoptionprocess.html or call 570-421-3647.",

CHANGED TO NEMO\n\nHe didnt answer to his former name and perhaps a new start with a new name will bring this beautiful boy great adventures with an owner that will keep him FOREVER!\n\nThis boy had a home in Miami Dade county since a small pup, but was forced to leave  by a disgruntled neighbor who called MDAS...and he was sent to an unknown, unchecked foster who placed him in BCAC due to him \"nor liking her\", needless to say that twit caused his near death when we took him out of the \"end of the line \" room of BCAC.\n\nWe took him with the hopes to reunite him legally with his family, however when told we could  possibly do this, the response was not what we had hoped and therfore he belongs with someone  who will go the distance to have him. He is worth at least that!\n\nHe was born May 3rd 2013  and is housebroken and such a good boy. However he is OBSESSED with water and an amazing swimmer. So if you have a pool.. he will get out on his own, from any side, however trying to stop him from going in is more of the issue and having him stay out is as well ...so if you have a pool be prepared to go in after him to get him out. Check out his own Facebook page   \"NEMO the swimming pit \"   He has crazy strong swimming skills!\n\nTo adopt contact www.misfitresq.org  Provide a phone number as well. \n\nAll dogs are spayed or neutered, chipped and vaccinated as well on current flea and hw prevention. Many are crate trained but he doesnt need one.",

Buddy gets along with other dogs, is highly food motivated, a typical hound, and very loyal. The nose rules so watch what you leave on your counter, but he responds well to correction with a tone making-type of collar for training. He is a gorgeous guy and has been a family dog since he was adopted 4 years ago. We suggest a home with no small children, due to his size. He has a fatty growth on his belly that is benign and won't need intervention unless it gets larger. (We would cover.)\n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you have questions about an animal, please complete an adoption application at sqrescueinc.org FIRST. Someone will reach out to you once you are approved and be able to answer all your questions. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs.

He was adopted when a young puppy.  In early June we received a call from an animal facility in St. Louis reporting that he was with them.  He had been brought in for observation at the age of 3-1/2 years because he had nipped a child.  When the 10 days were up he was not reclaimed by the family.  \nReport from the facility is that this was a play nip and there were no ER or medical or police reports filed as this was a minor and non-vicious incident.  Since his return Scooter has been in a home with several other dogs and is doing well there.  He has shown himself to be affectionate, smart, playful and certainly of good nature, although he does still nip in play occasionally.  He is in need of a new home where he is corrected with training and is never abandoned again.\nBorn 12/25/12",

Gets along with large more easy going dogs or those who will put her kindly in her place. She could use a good mentor dog. No cats or smaller dogs. \nShe's still getting weight on but turning into quite a pretty girl.\nNeeds continued training. Knows sit and learning to chill.\nMust have a fenced yard and a knowledgeable large dog owner who has the time and patience to continue to help her blossom.\nIndoor, loving, lifetime homes only. Children over 10 may be OK, she is real bouncy so no little ones.\nTon of potential.\nEmail alterupet@aol.com to inquire.\nPlease look over the criteria before inquiring.",

            "description": "PUPDATE 16 April 2020: The decision has been made that it is in the best interest for Syd to live out her life here. She will be considered a sanctuary dog and will be cared for as we care for our personal dogs.\nPUPDATE 26 April 2019: Yes, Syd is still here. Sadly, the experience she went through while in placement have made her difficult to rehome, so she will remain here until the perfect human for her is found.\nSyd is truly afraid of children and strangers. While she is lovely with people that she knows, she is fearful of the unknown and is pro-active in her reactive behaviour to protect herself. While we have found her to be easy to manage, her people must be diligent and advocate for her.\nSyd's perfect home would be a woman who loves to train and enjoys having her dog with her a lot. She would have a fenced yard and an outdoor kennel for when her person is away. Syd would LOVE to be an on-leash hiking partner and would truly thrive being part of a small pack and enjoying her people.\nPUPDATE 19 May 2017: Syd had been adopted, and was returned to us, as she was not managed appropriately in her home, and she became reactive to people entering the home. On return to the farm, we have worked with her and found that she quickly returned to appropriate behaviour when managed appropriately. Syd is currently in 'board and train' with our trainer on grounds.\nSyd will do best in a calm, multi-dog home that is interested in classes and continued learning for their dogs.\n*********\nThere's not much Syd couldn't do with the right person to partner with. She is currently picking up agility like a pro, and is eager to learn. Sid will do best in a home with another dog, and a human willing to fill her head with stuff. Syd needs moderate exercise to be happy here, though she does have other dogs to play with.\n\nPlease read our procedures prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. \n\nPlease go to our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time. The same dog may later become available if the adoption falls through. \n\nOur website www.mabcr.org will give you details on our adoption procedures as well as an application for adoption. An application must be submitted prior to 'matching' an adopter with a dog as all dogs do not fit into all homes. We pride ourselves in our adoption process, we take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can place a dog with them that they can enjoy for years to come.\n\nPlease understand that we will not discuss dogs with individual adopters until after the application process is completed.\n\nOur rescue does not have a public facility, therefore there are no visiting hours. Appointments to visit with the available dogs are made after the application process has been completed by our staff.  \n\nTo assist any dog within the MABCR organization, please consider making a donation to the general fund or to the medical fund. All dogs coming into our rescue are fully vetted (s/n and innoculations) prior to adoption.\n\nRescuing animals is quite expensive. If you are unable to adopt, but would like to help this, or any other animal in our system, please consider a sponsorship donation. \nFor information on our sponsorship program, please contact Sarah at SLR@mabcr.org. \n\n DONATE ONLINE USING PAYPAL\n\nThank you for your interest in Mid-Atlantic Border Collie Rescue.",

            "description": "Last Weigh-in: 82.8 lbs\n\nFoster Update: \u201cMilton is SUPER chill!  He loves to be outside but doesn't want a long walk. He prefers to layout on the porch in the sun.  He is very smart and will do just about anything for a treat. He is VERY food motivated!  He loves all humans, young and old, large and small. He is particular about dogs. So, I haven't had him around very many.\u201d\nMore about him from his foster:  Not very active, Leash trained, Does well in a car, Obedient, Affectionate, Gentle & Goofy  \n\n------------------------------------\nMilton's Story\nMilton was dumped into someone's backyard who unfortunately had no means to keep him. So he was then transferred to a local emergency center here in Memphis where his time was running out. Milton was abandoned underweight, sickly with a severely injured foot. So the founders of Streetdog Foundation were contacted and updated on his situation. And we did what we do best...swoop into the rescue! \n\nMilton was transferred to our vet where it was determined that his front leg had too much nerve damage and had to be amputated. He is also heavy heartworm positive and will undergo treatment for that as well once he recovers from surgery. Milton is an absolute rockstar and won't be letting anything hold him down. He's recovering at our vet right now but will be ready for a foster soon to help him down his road to wellness. Welcome to the best club around buddy we are thrilled to be here with you every step of the way to finding your forever home!\n\nMilton enjoys short walks and LONG naps.  He is super sweet and loves to snuggle.\n\nMedical Update\n2/16/18: Over the last several months, we\u2019ve noticed that Milton\u2019s amputation has really affected his mobility. We\u2019ve had a few dogs who have gone through this surgery and do well with getting around but Milton seems to really struggle. This is why we have chosen to get our sweet boy some new wheels! As supporters of our mission, you know that we do whatever is needed for our pups no matter what it takes. They\u2019re our family and we will always be their biggest advocates. At 3 years old, Milton has a lot of living to do and we don\u2019t want him restricted by his mobility. A new set of custom wheels will allow him to move in comfort.\n\n4/8/18: Milton got his wheels! Today we fitted Milton for his new cart. ? He was such a good boy and learned so fast! Stay tuned for more photos and videos!\n\n Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

Tito is such a Sweetie - he was rescued blind but with treatments he is able to see now!\n\nMy only special needs will be moisture drops over the counter. adoption fee is on my main profile at our website. I have been given all my age appropriate vaccinations and dewormed. I may need more depending on my age, puppies continue to get their vaccinations and dewormings up to 14 to 16 weeks. If I am a puppy, I will have an appt. to be altered (at our vet) my alter fee is included in the adoption donation fee. I have been treated with Frontline for fleas & ticks. Thanks soooo much for making adoption your first option - so many of my buddies need to get adopted too... so tell a friend to visit our website and help in the goal to have more pups find forever homes. If you are viewing me on Petfinder or one of the other rescue portals - please go to our main website: www.tlcwithpups.com - where you can find our adoption fees and our main profiles. There and you can fill out an application too. If you want it expedited be sure and call 951-742-8689 and email us at beaglesrbest@yahoo.com for faster service.",

He will be neutered soon and will be ready for adoption.\n\nThis little guy came to us with a limp and an abscess between his eyes.  After his vet visit we found he has a broken elbow and an infection. He is now on the road to recovery but will probably always have his limp.  He is very mild mannered and loves being around people.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you are interested in Patton or any of our adoptable pets, please e-mail us at bullysangelsdetroit@gmail.com.

I sometimes have a hard time making new friends, but I'm always trying to learn. My new family should come spend some time with me at the DAWG farm, so I can feel 100 percent comfortable. I always get told how smart I am and how lucky my new family will be. I am potty trained and know my basic commands. I love my fenced in yard to play, so that's my one request for my new home. Maybe you can come out to the farm to be my new friend! \n\nIf you want to bring me home or come see me, fill out an application at www.dawghous.com so my friends can put us in touch.",

We rescue Satos from the streets and beaches, give them medical care, food and shelter, and plenty of love. When they are healthy, we send them to one of our shelter partners for adoption into loving homes.\n\nDogs listed here are available for adoption only in the USA, unfortunately we are not able to adopt directly to an individual on Puerto Rico, unless we investigate and approve what will be the dog livings condition . We work exclusively with reputable partner shelters in the Northeast to find homes for our dogs. Once the dog has been transferred to a partner shelter we remove the listing here. If you would like to inquire about a specific dog we would be happy to provide you with the partner shelter contact information when the dog is transferred in order for possible adoption direct from the partner shelter. Please feel free to contact us at info@saveasato.org with any questions.",

            "description": "Hi, it is me... Simon!\n\nYou have probably seen me around here.  Are you in interested in adopting me? Please make sure you read my entire dating profile below before inquiring or applying for me.  These humans want what is best for me so they are not going to compromise on finding me my perfect furever home.  \n\nMy foster mom calls me a goofball.  I love to throw toys in the air, guard the backyard from birds and squirrels, and walk around the house with my dog bed on my back.  I march to the beat of my own drum and I am looking for a home with someone who \u201cgets me\u201d.\nThe humans in my family need to be kind and patient (I had a really rough start to life before coming to WSRH almost 5 years ago).  I like to push boundaries (no means yes, right?) so I need people who have good discipline and are not afraid to tell me no in a firm but nice way. I need people who will take the time to get to know me and my specific needs until I trust you.\n\nMy furever family:\n\n\u2022will be an all-adult household with no contact with small children (living in the house or visiting)\n\u2022will have a doggy door and a securely fenced backyard with a lock on the gate\n\u2022will not have a cat or any other small creature to stalk and catch\n\u2022will be a Westie (or similar) experienced household\n\u2022will have experience with \u201cdifficult\u201d personalities and will follow the guidance of the rescue\n\u2022will have a vet team that will work with specific needs ie. anesthesia for grooming, ear cleaning, and most medical procedures.\n\u2022will not put me in situations with humans I do not know and trust such as dog parks or public patios\n\u2022will live within 4 hours of Houston, TX to minimize stress during travel and transition.\n\n* Please note: Simon is safe with us and will stay that way until the right forever home is found. We absolutely will not consider a home in which he will come in contact with children nor one without the required experience.\n\nSimon is around 9 years old and has been fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $300 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Simon, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: www.wsrh.com. *** Please describe your experience with dogs with behavioral issues.\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life but I do my best to always keep a positive attitude!  When I was found I was barely hanging on, I had heartworms, rocky mountain spotted fever, and was anemic.  I required blood transfusions and wasn't health enough to eat normal food.  But look at me now!  Im healthy and happy.  My foster family and BTN have been life savers (literally)!  I\u2019m still a little timid, but can you blame me?  I also don\u2019t do well with cats.  Now that I\u2019m a healthy, happy dog again I\u2019m ready for my forever home!",

He had a terrible start, as he was found alongside a road, just lying there, his poor little ears had been freshly cropped. A good Samaritan took him in and fostered him until he made his journey to us. His ears are badly hacked but you cannot help but fall in love with him.

I am looking for a home where I can be an only dog.  I love to play and be goofy.\n\n \n\nI was found as a puppy as a stray.  I was very underweight.  My foster family took me in and got me healthy.  I was adopted to a single mom and several young children.  I loved the kids and was great with them.  But their life changed and they had to return me.\n\n \n\nI am a sweet boy who loves attention.  I am very gentle with humans even through I am a big guy.  I love to go from walks and car rides.  I love belly rubs and treats.\n\n \n\nI am looking for a home with a fenced in yard, a soft bed and hands to pet me.   \n\n \n\nIf interested in giving Blue a forever home, please complete an application at www.safeanimalhaven.org.  Thank you!\n\nWE FINALIZE EVERY ADOPTION WITH A HOME VISIT THEREFORE POTENTIAL HOMES MUST BE WITHIN A HOURS DRIVE TIME OF CHARLOTTE NC.
