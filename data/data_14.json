We could hang out and do dude things\u2014I mean, I am the rough-and-tumble sort! We could go the beach and scope out babes, or dudes, you know, whatever. I just want to hang out with you and be besties! I\u2019m fun and adventurous, so an active lifestyle is right up my alley. I love alleys\u2014they have so many interesting smells! I love to go for walks and take in the aromas of the world. I get along great with the other dogs here but try to boss around the more sensitive pooches in my playgroup, I will adore all the fun and attention that sturdy children 12+ have to offer, but I need a cat-free family that understands I lack some impulse control. A family savvy with herding breeds will be ideal! My crate training is going very well, and I know how to \u201csit\u201d and \u201cshake\u201d when asked! I have so much to learn still and am hoping for a patient, committed, and energetic person to show me the ropes. Let\u2019s see if we could be friends! You will never know another Buddy quite like me!",

Barry is a totally Hollywood picture worthy Shepherd mix who is about a year old and weighs around 50 lbs full grown. Barry is a mostly blond guy with the typical black muzzle and a personality that is huge, both in terms of fun and energy as well as outgoing. He is definitely the social butterfly of any group. Barry is great with the other dogs, boys and girls alike and could easily fit into a home with another dog. He would love adventures and activity and would likely love to go just about anywhere with you, hoping to learn about the big wide world as well as the comfy home of you and yours. Barry can walk on a leash and is learning lots of things about crate training, proving to be smart as well as handsome. He is the total package and cannot wait to hop in the car and skedaddle on home with you ASAP!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

I am a 5-year-old spayed female blue merle rough Collie, and I am looking for a very special family because I am a special needs dog. I am super sweet, fully vetted, housebroken and love hanging out with my foster mom and her fabulous Collie Casey. I usually spend my days lounging on my bed, sunning myself on the deck if the weather is good and doing typical Collie stuff like checking for crumbs on the floor. I'm not real active because when I was a little puppy I had a head injury but I need folks that will keep me moving with gentle walks. I have recently discovered the joys of T-touch. My foster mom has been studying T-touch on the Internet and she called Hope one morning and said, \"Miri has awakened!\" The stimulation of gentle hands all over me has made me feel alive! I don't let my disabilities stop me even though I am blind in my left eye, a little hard of hearing on that same side and I walk with a little shuffle. I would love a stay at home mom or dad, with a one-story house that is easy for me to navigate. I have a passion for eating, so I am on a low calorie diet with fresh veggies added. I also take thyroid meds every day and need a couple of drops in my eyes twice a day. Easy Peasy, huh? My foster mom says I blossom every day and make her smile, so I think I would make a great family member with your love and patience. But remember, I am not just a pretty face.\n\nThe first step toward any placement is a completed adoption application which you will find online at www.colliesheltierescue.org. Without a completed application, there is no place to start a conversation.\n\n2/2/21 4:21 PM",

He's a beautiful dog with lots of energy and enthusiasm for just about everything and everyone in his path. He taught this small dog owner a thing or two about walking a larger, strong dog on a leash. Once I got the hang of it he was ready to play. Wasn't sure how affectionate he would be until I sat on the grass and he joyfully jumped on me for a minute until desperately wanting to find what might be in my backpack. His suspicion was correct. He enjoyed a quick treat and off we went. Nitro seemed most excited at the sight of children playing and he reacted well (stayed close and quiet) when small dogs lost their cool and barked at him. He's a good boy and loves to be praised. At the end of our walk I was a sweaty, muddy mess (did I mention he was playful?) and he looked at me with this priceless expression that seemed to say, \"Thanks. You'll get the hang of this. Let's do it again some time.\" Check him out and see how he's even more gorgeous in person!\n\nNitro is a sweet boy he was found by some people who were driving after a storm. They posted him on the proper sites in hopes of finding his owner. He is a love bug, likes to cuddle, and is very playful. He love loves his ladies so he would do best in a home with females only as he is not comfortable with men. Although he does come around when given the time and reassurance. He loves to swim, play fetch, and give lots of kisses.",

She's now available for adoption through PCPOUNDPUPPIES.\nBella is a 6 month old solid black lab mix currently weighing in at 36lbs. She's up to date on all her vaccinations and is scheduled to be spayed on 2-10-21. Bella has been working on her house training and is getting better with time. She does fine in the kennel with occasional barking if something interesting is happening. Bella loves food time and eats twice a day on an elevated feeder beside our other dog. She will sit for a treat and loves her hard chew toys. She is currently in foster with both a small and large dog and two cats. She does fine with kids too. Know that Bella has A LOT of energy and loves to walk and wrestle with other dogs. She also sheds quite a bit and will be in need of occasional brushing. Overall she'd make a perfect family pet, especially if there is another dog to play with. If interested contact PCPOUNDPUPPIES or fill out an application through their website.\nHer fee is $150. We have a two week foster to adopt trial program where we can loan you a crate, leash and collar. ***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

He\u2019s friendly and outgoing and would like to have a nice yard in which to run and play with his family.  He\u2019s very sweet and friendly. \nWe will add more information as we get to know him better. \nIf you\u2019d like to meet Chase, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nChase\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.  The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.  Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.  Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.  We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human. \nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason. \n",

It seems he was previously well taken care of as he was clean and well fed. He is a friendly boy who has crate manners. He has been great with the other dogs in his foster home, the kitty, and the children so far. We are guessing that he is a husky mix or cattle dog mix, but do not know for sure. If you believe Huck would be a fit for you please submit an application using the link below. \n\nAdoption Application:\nhttps://airtable.com/shr305FuyR4v4JWQb\n\nFacebook Link:\nhttps://m.facebook.com/furrytalesanimalrescue/\n\nWebsite Link: https://furrytalesrescue.wixsite.com/home\n\n** We are based out of Blue Bell, PA. We allow out of state adoptions to NJ, MD, DE, and NY. At this time we do not adopt out to homes who are over 120 miles from our location. We do prioritize more local applications who are a match for the dog/puppy they are applying for.*\n",

I am on the search for the best thing I could ever ask for: a forever family. Word on the doggy grapevine is that this is the place to make it happen. So I was hoping to wander my way here to FDNLS, and thankfully I was able to hitch a flight, all the way from Maui! Can you believe my luck? So here I am, and Habibi is looking for love! I get along well with all the other dogs here, but tell those pesky cats, no way! I'm working on my crate training here and will need to continue working on it and my basics in my new home. As long as your little ones aren\u2019t tail-tuggers, I think I could get along just fine in a family with kids! I do have arthritis so I like to be treated gently. Now maybe you would consider having me wander into your life?",

You know, all I really want is to be loved\u2026and to give love in return. Have someone give me comfort and stability. People like to assume that because of my size I am overbearing and oafish. But I am really just a laid-back guy who likes head scratches and long walks with my people. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve got some brute strength that you mostly see when I\u2019m on leash\u2026so a good walking harness will really come in handy! I'll do great in a home with sturdy children or other dogs, but cats and I just don\u2019t get along. I know crate training well and love to have my own little den to call my own. Step up to do battle with me, little David, but cast no stones. Let love be the weapon of choice, and companionship the prize to share.",

A low-traffic home where I can take my time getting to know new people will be best. I am playful and very loving, but I get stressed out easily, so a calm environment and slow intros to new things will suit me best. I love to play with other dogs, and am used to living with cats too! My crate training is coming along great and I am housebroken already, but due to my sensitivity to overhandling I need a family with kids 12+. So what do you say, are you ready to sink your teeth into a lifetime of companionship? \n\n",

            "description": "Teddy is a 1-2 year old cute and goofy boy! Teddy loves everyone he meets. Teddy gets along with cats and dogs, but he can play a little too roughly with them. He would currently do best in a home with no small children, as he is high energy and can be a little rambunctious at times. Teddy is a great dog, and he just completed training with a personal dog trainer. He is still the goofy and playful boy he was before, but he has learned to mind his manners and understand boundaries better. \nTeddy is in urgent need of a home! Please fill out the adoption application below if you are interested in meeting him! \n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, at least one round of parvo distemper vaccine and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

There has been talk since I arrived at the farm about lab mix, hottie (I think I like that one), sweet guy and something about 2 years or so old. Being a happy and flexible guy, I am pleased with just about anything when it involves love and attention. I love to be outside, love to run with friends, and consider most everyone a buddy, people and dogs alike. I am well behaved, don't jump on people, don't bark my head off, and I will let you know when I need to go outside. I would love to have some of my own chew toys, but I won't chew on anything not offered to me. Personal space is not a concept I'm aware of, as my favorite spot is right by your side. I've been total I'm a real couch potato and leaner. Honestly not sure where I learned manners, but I do know how to act like a gentleman they say. When it comes to my crate, happy to wait there or take a nap, I'm easy going that way. I don't know too many tricks, but am happy to practice with some yummy treats. What I really want more than anything is some people of my own, to live with furever. Love, attention, snuggles, and smooches are top on my list for 2021 and everything else is just gravy. I've heard about gravy.can we add that to my list of wishes? Last thing....swear! See you at the farm! Love, Kravtiz\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

I have lots of love to give and I'm looking for my forever home.\n\nI love people and lots of attention so I would be happiest in a home where my people are home most of the time and can dote on me everyday.\n\nI love to snuggle in bed or hang out on the couch and relax. I enjoy car rides and walks too.\n\nI haven't been around kids much as I lived only with my owner in my previous home. I would most likely be ok with an older respectful child, we would have to meet and see how it goes. I have always been an only dog and prefer that as I can get a little jealous if another dog is around.\n\nI am housebroken, weigh about 25 lbs and know most commands. I will need to be groomed regularly to maintain my handsome look. I am neutered and up to date on my shots.\n\nI would really need a fenced yard as I love to romp around in the backyard and explore all the sights and sounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting me please fill out the adoption application. Scout's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives plus a free basic obedience course at Cedar Run Pet Boarding & Daycare in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home vist.",

She snorts, she snores when she sleeps, she runs around with unbridled joy. She loves toys and loves love more. She has the funniest and sweetest expressions and mannerisms. This girl is so grateful to be alive. Maple most likely had some tough beginnings. She was bred way more than any dog should ever be and shows the remnants of that treatment. Her spirit is not dampened in the least bit by anything she endured previously. She is a party in a dog coat and has us laughing daily. She is short and stocky and will probably top out in the 50 lbs range, once she gains some weight. Her face looks as if she is a combination of  a Bulldog and a Pug. \nIf you are interested in Maple, please go to our website at peaceandpaws.org to begin the application process. We can answer any questions once your application has been approved.\nAdoption fee is $475 and includes her spay, vaccinations, HW/Fecal tests, deworming, microchip and health certificate. All dogs are on heart worm and flea and tick preventative.",

Max loved his family and they loved him, so their decision to re-home was a difficult one but ultimately a safety issue (due to resource guarding) and best for Max. \n\nBecause Max has a tendency to herd animals and people, he is better suited for a family with older children and no cats or chickens.  Max has a very high prey drive!  His high prey drive makes him a perfect dog for anyone wanting to excel in herding, obedience or agility.  Without proper training his prey drive can potentially be a safety issue as he has no impulse control over chasing cars and fast moving objects \n\nHe is smart!  Max knows: Go To Your Mat and hold a Down/Stay, Come, Sit, Down, Stand, Touch/Hand Target, Walking Loose in Leash & Leave It.  He knows the cue \"Go Potty\" when you take him outside to eliminate.\n\nMax is nervous meeting new dogs. He has some food guarding issues (another reason for no small children) that need a savvy owner to continue working on.\nMaxi is looking for someone experienced with herding breeds, have a plan for his energy level & Border Collie prey drive, and be committed to continuous consistent daily training. \n",

He is a goofy and super friendly boy that will make a loyal companion. We know he will make a great pet to someone who gives him a chance! \n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, at least one round of parvo distemper vaccine and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

He's approximately 5 yrs of age and he came from a cruelty case. He was kept in a small kennel and was not treated very well although he doesn't show any signs of neglect on the inside. Dudley has retained every ounce of sweetness and is a loving and affectionate dog. We will get to know more about him in the coming weeks but wanted you all to meet him too. Dudley LOVES toys and loves affection with equal enthusiasm. We are working on crate training, house training and all the basics. He is a bit underweight at the moment but imagine he will top off somewhere in the 60lbs + range. \nIf you are interested in Dudley, please go to our website at peaceandpaws.org to begin the application process. We can answer any questions once your application has been approved.\nAdoption fee is $475 and includes his neuter, vaccinations, HW/Fecal tests, deworming, microchip and health certificate. All dogs are on heart worm and flea and tick preventative.",

            "description": "Hefner can't hold a candle to Hughseriously folksget this young lab mix a smoking jacket and silk kerchief and you have a media mogul on your hands! Hugh is a completely adorable, handsome, charming and fun as heck young lab mix who likes people, dogs and surely even bunnies though he likes to keep things clean and wholesome so will stick with the non human kind of those! He is about a year or so old and weighs a lean 45 lbs, though could use some extra kibble to fill out and fatten up a bit. Hugh is all about fun and games and loves pretty much everything he meets. He is a super sweet guy who is also clearly built to be athletic with a sleek black coat and a wonderful energy level that keeps him moving and grooving without even seeming like exercise. He would love a family with another dog for a playmate but doesn't need one to be happy. He is active and loves going and doing, can handle being on a leash well and knows all about being a good boy in a crate. Add Hugh to your family and you're instantly famousin the neighborhoodbut who can't use a celeb in the house right?\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

He's chill with the cats, and he's chill with the dogs, and he's chill with the horses and of course, he's chill with all people. Woody was found in the middle of nowhere probably faithfully waiting for his family to come back for him. It took his rescuer the better part of an hour to earn his trust and save him. Now he's the best pet. He's grateful for meals and minds his manners! He gets along well with everyone and is super easy. His family who dumped him must have quit feeding him and didn't protect his heart from heartworm disease, but the rescue will provide moxi-doxy treatment until he tests negative. He has gained weight and been brought up to date on his vaccinations and will be neutered very soon. He's almost ready to join his forever family and share his faithful and chill personality! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters so every meet and greet can has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online.We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

            "description": "PLEASE READ: Thank you for your interest in one of our adoptable dogs! All dogs listed are still available. If interested, please complete our no obligation application. This can be found at www.waldosmuttleycrew.org. Select the Applications tab, then Adoption Application. THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. It can take up to a week to process an application. We are an all-volunteer rescue so please be patient.\n\nOur adoption area is limited to a 4 hour radius of Indianapolis. We try our best to provide all information in our bios. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask during the interview process. Some of our dogs have special requirements such as needs another dog in the home or requires a physical and permanent fenced yard. These requirements are not negotiable. Unless otherwise noted, we do not cat test our adoptable dogs. We also require that all pets in your household be spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and on a monthly heartworm/flea preventative.\n\nE-MAILS: We do not respond to e-mail inquiries without an application. We regret that we cannot respond to every e-mail unless you fill out an application.\n\nAll the dogs we offer for adoption have been spayed/neutered, wormed and microchipped, are up-to-date on immunizations, have been tested for heartworm and are currently receiving a monthly preventative. If the dog had additional medical issues, those have also been addressed. Visit our website www.waldosmuttleycrew.org for more information and to complete an application.\nFrederick Douglas, a 6 year old rottweiler/beagle mix weighing 55 lbs, is the Belly Rub Connoisseur ... he's gotten it down to a science! He's figured out the exact head tilt to use in conjunction with his soft, brown eyes that will make you stop whatever you are doing and give that belly a rub. Freddie is also adept at contorting himself into the ideal position so you can find the perfect spot! Freddie is such a silly boy! And when you get home, he loves to greet you with a hug and a wagging tail! He loves all people, big & small! Freddie doesn't always realize how big he is so can knock \"wee ones\" over without meaning to so would probably be too much for kids under 8 years of age. Frederick is submissive & eager to please, so learns quicky. He's an active boy who loves to run & play and would be a great walking companion. He does great with other dogs as well; he's just has a wonderful temperament! However, Fred would not be recommended with cats; he gets too interested in them so we can't guarantee that he wouldn't chase them. He still has occasional accidents so will need a bit more work on potty training. He will require a fenced in yard in his new home so that he has room to run.\nWe rescued Frederick from a shelter 3 months ago where he was going to be euthanized for space. He had a chronic cough that was not going away despite treatments of various rounds of antibiotics and the use of inhalers. We finally took him to an internal medicine specialist had tests run and have found that Freddie has chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchioles in his lungs). At this point, it's a permanent condition that just means he will always have a cough. He will need to be kept on very low doses of steroids (which are very cheap) for the rest of his life to keep the swelling in the bronchioles down and occasionally may need a cough syrup at times of increased coughing. Other than that, he's a",

            "description": "PLEASE READ: Thank you for your interest in one of our adoptable dogs! All dogs listed are still available. If interested, please complete our no obligation application. This can be found at www.waldosmuttleycrew.org. Select the Applications tab, then Adoption Application. THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. It can take up to a week to process an application. We are an all-volunteer rescue so please be patient.\n\nOur adoption area is limited to a 4 hour radius of Indianapolis. We try our best to provide all information in our bios. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask during the interview process. Some of our dogs have special requirements such as needs another dog in the home or requires a physical and permanent fenced yard. These requirements are not negotiable. Unless otherwise noted, we do not cat test our adoptable dogs. We also require that all pets in your household be spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and on a monthly heartworm/flea preventative.\n\nE-MAILS: We do not respond to e-mail inquiries without an application. We regret that we cannot respond to every e-mail unless you fill out an application.\n\nAll the dogs we offer for adoption have been spayed/neutered, wormed and microchipped, are up-to-date on immunizations, have been tested for heartworm and are currently receiving a monthly preventative. If the dog had additional medical issues, those have also been addressed. Visit our website www.waldosmuttleycrew.org for more information and to complete an application.\nWe adore our Romani! She's so gentle & submissive; and you want to talk a great smile? She seriously grins when she's happy to see you! It'll melt even the coldest of hearts! Romani is a petite 2 1/2 year old german shepherd/border collie mix currently weighing about 40 lbs; we'd like to get another 5 lbs on her as she's still a bit thin. This girl has had a tough life. She was a stray for at least two years; animal control caught her twice during that period but she escaped from them both times. The third time they asked if we would take her. It's amazing that despite spending almost her whole life on the run, she loves the feel of human touch so much! She leans right up against you and snuggles as close as she can get!\nRomani is in a foster home with 7 other dogs and co-habitates well with them. Our girl doesn't really engage in play with the others; she doesn't seem to know how sadly. She will lie on the sofa near the others and doesn't mind if they are around her and does like barking at squirrels with them. Romani really needs a home where she can get tons of attention; she craves affection & is happiest when she's being touched so she'd be thrilled to not have to compete with so many dogs for cuddles. Because she can still be a bit timid with new people & new situations, we do feel she would do best with one other confident dog in the home who would show she could cue off to see that everything is safe. Romani will also need at least a 5 foot physical fence as she can easily scale anything shorter. \nAlthough she is extremely easygoing, we do not think that Romani would do well in a home with small children as she is still fearful of new situations. She needs a calm & quiet environment filled where she can continue to grow in confidence. If you think that you would be a good fit for Romani, please let us know. Her adoption fee is $250; she is spayed, microchipped and current on vaccinations as well as monthly heartworm/flea preventative. Applications are available at waldosmuttleycrew.org .

He is a high energy puppy so will definitely need an active family and would love love another playful dog in the home.  Butters would do well with kids but he is still a puppy so he can be rough in play and bite.\n\nButters is working on crate, leash, and house training as he is still very young.  Continued training will be needed in his forever home. \n\nButters is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.

We were strays wandering around and found by a nice lady who cared for us for a few days before bringing us in.  We have lived up to what she said about us!  We are both very dog friendly.  I am about 40 lbs and 1.5 years old.  I love playing and would love a home with another friendly dog to play with.  I also love kids!  We shower them with kisses and of course want to be all over them.  We have met two cats (pretty large cats) and we were more afraid than anything else - (come on -they were big!).  We are very food motivated and take treats gently.  We need to perfect our housebreaking and of course our leash etiquette but overall, we are just awesome young dogs.  We are not bonded BUT could still go together of course.  We love each other but don't NEED each other to survive.

Riggs was rescued from a local shelter.  \n\nRiggs loves to play with toys and people. He loves running and playing in the yard with sticks and other dogs. He is a high energy puppy so will definitely need an active family and would love love another playful dog in the home.  Riggs would do well with kids but he is still a puppy so he can be rough in play and bite.\n\nRiggs is working on crate, leash, and house training as he is still very young.  Continued training will be needed in his forever home. \n\nRiggs is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Riggs and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

She thoroughly enjoys a game of fetch or tug o war. She enjoys dog friends, but might be too rough for dogs that don't want to play. She is high energy and likes to wrestle with other dogs. She is fostered with large and small dogs. She is fostered with cats, but needs to be reminded not to chase them. She is sometimes reactive to loud noises so we feel she is needs a home without small children or a lot of commotion. Bells prefers to eat her meals in crate. She is well trained in her crate and enjoys peanut butter kongs to keep herself entertained. She would love an active family, maybe even a running partner. She also loves to snuggle on the couch and watch a movie. If you are interested in meeting this adorable girl and adding her to your family, she is accepting applications for adoption now!\nAdopters must be willing to travel to meet Bells in Huntington, WV.",

We were strays wandering around and found by a nice lady who cared for us for a few days before bringing us in.  We have lived up to what she said about us!  We are both very dog friendly.  I am about 50 lbs and 1.5 years old.  I love playing and would love a home with another friendly dog to play with.  I also love kids!  We shower them with kisses and of course want to be all over them.  We have met two cats (pretty large cats) and we were more afraid than anything else - (come on -they were big!).  We are very food motivated and take treats gently.  We need to perfect our housebreaking and of course our leash etiquette but overall, we are just awesome young dogs.  We are not bonded BUT could still go together of course.  We love each other but don't NEED each other to survive.  Please email erin@asecondchanceforziva.com for more info!\n\n\n*********************************************************************************\nA Second Chance for Ziva, Inc.

He is instantly best friends with every two or four footed being who comes across his path. There is no cat in his foster home to test out if he is cat-friendly.\n\nBuck is also heartworm negative, kennel trained and largely potty-trained. Not surprisingly, he\u2019s a \u201cvelco dog\u201d who wants to be with his people and will keep you company every step of the way.  And he\u2019ll probably have a ball in his mouth while trotting around after you.\n\nBecause he\u2019s only 1.5 years old, he\u2019ll need regular exercise and playing to meet his youthful energy level. \n\nEmail info@habitat4paws.org for an application.\n\n**Because we require home visits, we only adopt locally to the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Little Lincoln is a handsome 2-month-old boy who currently weighs about 11 pounds. We think he will grow to be 45 to 55 pounds as an adult. A perfect day for Lincoln would include a trip to puppy socialization class, a nice walk with his favorite person, and lots of cuddles. Lincoln's adoption fee is $350 and he is a SHELTER HERO! Which means 100% of his adoption fee goes towards other animals in the shelter. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Lincoln or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the PUPPY'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

            "description": "***CONSIDERABLE GERMAN SHEPHERD AND/OR OTHER WORKING BREED EXPERIENCE REQUIRED***\n\nMeet Bailey, our happy and spunky senior GSD boy!  Bailey is approximately between 7-8 years old, but he is still full of energy!  Bailey was originally surrendered to our facility in very poor condition.  He was missing most of the fur on his body, and he was severely emaciated.  After bringing Bailey to the vet, it was determined his condition was from extreme malnourishment and a severe flea infestation.  He has since been treated for the fleas and has been eating very well.  In the short time he was with us, Bailey gained a ton of weight from regular feeding and some of his hair did grow back.\nHe was adopted from our shelter into a great home for a couple months.  Unfortunately, for no fault of his own, Bailey was returned to our shelter.  \n\nDespite what Bailey has gone through, he is still a very loving and friendly dog! Bailey loves getting attention from people!  Bailey is very food motivated and loves treats.  He can be grabby with treats as he was underfed for so long.  Bailey seems to be fine with other dogs, but he is not a fan of cats. \n\nWe are requiring potential adopters to have CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE with German Shepherd, and/or other working breeds, to adopt Bailey.  He does seem to listen better to men than women. Bailey can be adopted into a home with another dog pending a meet and greet.  He can go to a home with older children, preferably 13 years old or older.  He is neutered and up to date on vaccinations. Although some of his hair has grown back, Bailey does have Alopecia, and will most likely not grow anymore hair on his body in the spots where he is already bald.  \nBailey is ready for his forever family to take him home and give him the life he really deserves!  If you are interested in adopting Bailey, and have the experience we require, Please Email us at Adotp@savingpawsct.org for more info!\n\nMAC IS OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK (M-F 8-4pm) (Sat-Sun 10-4pm) Appts to meet dogs can made to suit your schedule, please email/call for an appt. We do prefer to be contacted by email for adoption inquiries at Adopt@savingpawsct.org. The office phone number is  203-235-4179.  Leave a message, and someone will call you back promptly.\n\nYou must be 21 years of age to adopt with valid ID. There is a short application for adoption, however if you do not own your home, or you own a condo, we must speak with your landlord or housing association giving permission to dogs/cats. Bully breed specific permission is required if you rent or own a condo. If you own your home, proof of home ownership is required. If there are other pets in the home they must be licensed (if a dog) and up to date on vaccinations. If there is another dog in the home a dog interaction must be done at the shelter before adoption, to ensure the safety and well being of all pets. All children in the home need to be declared and brought down to meet the animal.\nApplications must be submitted and approved BEFORE a meet and greet can be scheduled to meet an animal.\n\nALL ANIMALS ARE SPAYED AND NEUTERED BEFORE THEY GO HOME.\nFor more info please call 230-235-4179 (Always Leave A Message) or email adopt@savingpawsct.org",

            "description": "Cola was rescued with her 3 puppies from a home with too many outdoor dogs.  She didn't know what being inside was until she arrived at her foster's.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Sept. 2018, Cola weighs about 10 lb now.  She's timid, but has warmed up to her foster mom.\n\n**********\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  Requirement is a minimum three year vet history documenting current / previous pets are spayed / neutered, kept up to date on core vaccinations, and on heartworm prevention.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control agency.\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

I like kids, but can be unpredictable with them, so no kids in the home would be best for me.\n I need a quiet home where there is not a lot of traffic. I am great with my people but can become agitated and snap at new people. I am working on muzzle training so that I am able to go out and visit safely. I would love a fenced yard where I can chase squirrels and sun bathe when it gets warmer out.\nI am housebroken and crate trained. I am very playful and love to snuggle with my person.\n\n\nPlease check out our adoption process & on-line application here: https://www.newhopepetrescue.com/\n\nAdoption Fee for dogs cover the following vetting:\n\n1. UTD on shots (age appropriate)\n2. Wormed\n3. HW tested (over 1 year old)\n4. Micro-chipped\n5. Spayed/neutered\n\nAdoption Fee for cats cover the following vetting:\n\n1.

            "description": "Fourier is a darling little 6 month old, tri-color Chiweenie boy. He is a very outgoing little fella who is very friendly to everyone and gets along with all sorts of people and dogs. He is happy, playful and affectionate. He\u2019d love to have children in his family and a nice fenced backyard in which to run and play with his family. He\u2019s not housetrained yet, but he\u2019s a smart little guy and will pick it up quickly. Fourier is at the perfect age for learning all the behaviors and tricks you would like him to know at your house. \nIf you\u2019d like to meet Fourier, the first step is to request an adoption application where it says \u201cAsk About Fourier\u201d and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nFourier\u2019s adoption fee is $400 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.  The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.  Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.  Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.  We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human. \nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason. \n",

            "description": "Wally is looking for a quiet, adult only, dog experienced home with a yard. \n\nWally is a sweet little poodle mix. He is about 4 years old and currently 24 lbs. He is affectionate, playful, quirky and funny. He enjoys going for walks, taking rides in the car and exploring in the yard. He likes to romp around in the house and yard playing tug and chase with his dog buddies. Over time he becomes very bonded to his people and will happily follow them around throughout the day. \n\nWally was reportedly neglected during his early years of life. He can be distrustful with strangers and in new situations but has shown he will warm up with slow, gentle introductions and treats. Wally can become overwhelmed with a lot of excitement and noise so a fairly quiet adult only home works best for him. He is most comfortable with calm, firm, positive training and does not do well with harsh discipline. He responds well to leadership, rules, boundaries, routine and affection in that order. When he has a confident person who provides these things he is a delightful, affectionate and happy boy. If he does not receive leadership he becomes confused, insecure, nervous and will display undesirable behaviors. \n\nWally is crate trained, house broken and learning to walk politely on a leash. He gets along with other well behaved dogs but needs a cat free home. He enjoys having a friendly, non dominant companion dog to pal around with and keep him company while his humans are away from home. A home where he is not left alone daily for long hours would be ideal. Wally would do well with an experienced dog savvy person who has the time, patience and willingness to provide the leadership, rules, boundaries and structure that he requires to be a sweet, polite, confident, family member. Wally is a little sweetheart who is patiently waiting for his forever home.\n\nPlease email right away if you would like to learn more about this dog......and visit our website www.siarescuers.org to learn more about our rescue group.   Adoption fees range from $200-$400 for dogs.  THE DOGS SHOWN ON THE SITE ARE IN FOSTERCARE - WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER TO VISIT.  EMAIL is the best way to reach us.We are a volunteer run, very small organization - so please be patient when waiting for a response, but feel free to check back in if you haven't heard from us in a day or so - thank you so much for considering a rescued pooch!",

            "description": "PLEASE READ: Thank you for your interest in one of our adoptable dogs! All dogs listed are still available. If interested, please complete our no obligation application. This can be found at www.waldosmuttleycrew.org. Select the Applications tab, then Adoption Application. THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. It can take up to a week to process an application. We are an all-volunteer rescue so please be patient.\n\nOur adoption area is limited to a 4 hour radius of Indianapolis. We try our best to provide all information in our bios. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask during the interview process. Some of our dogs have special requirements such as needs another dog in the home or requires a physical and permanent fenced yard. These requirements are not negotiable. Unless otherwise noted, we do not cat test our adoptable dogs. We also require that all pets in your household be spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and on a monthly heartworm/flea preventative.\n\nE-MAILS: We do not respond to e-mail inquiries without an application. We regret that we cannot respond to every e-mail unless you fill out an application.\n\nAll the dogs we offer for adoption have been spayed/neutered, wormed and microchipped, are up-to-date on immunizations, have been tested for heartworm and are currently receiving a monthly preventative. If the dog had additional medical issues, those have also been addressed. Visit our website www.waldosmuttleycrew.org for more information and to complete an application.\nAspen is a beautiful 3 year old redtick coonhound who loves people! She is definitely happiest when she is with her humans so would prefer a home where she isn't left alone for long lengths of time. Aspen really wants to be friends with other dogs but sadly is very lacking in doggy social skills; she just doesn't understand canine language so misinterprets play stances as aggression & runs away or thinks that grumbles of irritation are invitations to play chase. We have been working with her and she is doing so much better. We think she would be best in a home with a large dog who is confident without being aggressive so as to continue showing her how to assimilate into a dog pack (which she desperately wants to do). However, we do think Aspen would do fine as an only dog as well as long as her people were with her most of the time. \nAs are most hounds, Aspen is active & will definitely require a physical 5 foot fence. She is a \"scent hound\" and will follow her nose given a chance. \nAspen doesn't seem to have had much attention in the past so absolutely melts when you start petting her. If you think you can give her the love she deserves, please let us know. Her adoption fee is $200; she is spayed, microchipped and current on vaccinations as well as monthly heartworm/flea preventative. Applications are available at waldosmuttleycrew.org .

Mom is about 12lbs and it's reasonable to think these little ones will be under 15lbs when full grown. Mom came into our rescue pregnant. She was a part of a group of 11 dogs who were abandoned and neglected and we took them all in. It's been quite a ride with all of them. And now this little litter is ready to go...\n\nThese puppies do not have the non-shedding coat. They will shed. These cutie pies are all incredibly affectionate and playful. However, they all have their own unique little quirks that we absolutely adore. Cremini, with her love of toys and playtime, is the perfect pup for someone who wants a dog to make them laugh. Portobello is super cuddly. She loves to fall asleep in people's arms. Porcini, with his affectionate nature and gentleness, is just the pup for someone who wants a couch buddy. And last but not least, is Enoki. Enoki is super cuddly and has surprising intelligence. Lets just say that whoever gets to take care of any of these puppies is very lucky!\n\nIn between napping, snuggling, and eating, these puppies are working on some basic training. They have also established a daily routine with their foster:\n\n\"The puppies will usually wake up around 7-8 AM and demand to be let out of their playpen. From there, they run to the potty pads to do their business, and then the kitchen where they eat both canned food and kibble. They'll run around the living room, crawl into the toy box, and wrestle with their mom and our dog Squish. Their favorite game is hide and seek under the coffee table where they'll play fight with each other for hours, then cuddle together, and fall asleep.\n\nThey also have their own unique personalities:\n\nCremini: Cremini is polar-bear white and has the largest floppy ears out of the four. However, on top of her cuteness she also has a playful personality. She loves to wrestle with her siblings and once she finds a toy she likes, she will proudly carry it around the room and show everyone. Too cute! She prefers to play with her siblings and the adult dogs in the house but if everyone is sleeping, she will find herself a toy to chew on. She is also super affectionate and is a sucker for belly rubs. She will roll over every time she sees you to get some scratches.\n\nPortobello: Portobello is beige and the roundest of them all. This \"roundness\" makes her the ideal cuddle buddy for us humans. While she likes to sleep on her own (away from her siblings) she LOVES to sleep in someone's arms. In addition she has a wonderfully balanced personality of playful and chill qualities. On top of her cuddly nature, she also likes to play rough with her siblings. In terms of training, Portobello is good about always doing her business on the potty pad.\n\nPorcini: Porcini is the most independent from his siblings but the most attached to his mom. He was the third one born and is the only male. He is a little more sensitive than the rest, and will get spooked if picked up too quickly. But once he's in your arms, he will sit still for hours and lick your face if you talk to him. He likes to play chase but tires easily and will find a corner to rest away from his loud sisters. This gentleness and calmness makes him a very sweet dog. He just makes your heart melt!\n\nEnoki: Enoki is the youngest one and kind of looks like a lamb with her curly fur. However, even though she might be the youngest, she does not lack intelligence. She is the only one who knows how to go up and down the stairs and she can climb onto the couch (we're still not sure how she gets up there!) In addition to her intelligence, she is super cuddly. If someone lies on the ground, Enoki will find somewhere comfortable on them or next to them and cuddle up to sleep. Finally, similarly to her siblings, she is very playful. She's very fast and loves to chase after squeaky toys.\n\nBetty's puppies have been living in a home with family dogs so they are dog socialized. They also could be options for cats who are dog savvy and don't mind putting up with the antics of puppies.\n\nThe Betty puppies are only options for those who have had a dog in the last three years. This is a requirement not a suggestion. It is not met by petsitting, roommate's dogs and/or family pets that remained in the family home. We believe that puppies need the most experienced homes and that is why we seek this type of home. If there are children they need to be over the age of 8.",

Our girl is a 2 year old, short coat, Black And Tan With A Little Merle, 70 pound, love sponge! \n\nMs Jade is great with other dogs (slightly submissive), people of all ages and in particular children. This young lady will need a fairly settled environment due to her past abuse. Despite her past she is open, very friendly and meets strangers very well. Jade enjoys exercise be it, walks, hikes, swims or play, yet she is very comfortable spending the evening laying at your feet. Getting along with all of the dogs at our rescue has been a real strong point for her, she is just very accommodating in her openness and gentle demeanor. This girl is a real \"keeper\".\n___________________________________________\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE\n<strong>About Our Rescue</strong>\n\nWhether you adopt through Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Organization or any other similar organization, the LEAST we can do is thank you from the bottom of our hearts for considering welcoming these deserving dogs into your hearts and home. One of our favorite sayings is \"RESCUE IS THE BEST BREED,\" and we believe that wholeheartedly. Help us help these dogs and submit your application today! We appreciate that you want to help make a difference in the lives of dogs who need us most!!! RESCUE ROCKS!\n\n<b><i>Disclaimer: Please note that the breeds posted on our dogs' biographies are our best guess based on years of working with rescue dogs. Adopters who need to know the exact breed or mix of breeds of a particular dog must have the dog's DNA tested at their own expense.</i></b>\n\n<center><b>To see more photos of this dog and all our adoptable dogs,<br>please check out our website at <a href=\"http://rescuedogvillage.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Dog Village</a></b>.</center>\n\n___________________________________________\nRESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5013C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n\nOUR DOGS ARE MICRO-CHIPPED AND READY TO BE PART OF YOUR FAMILY TODAY!\n___________________________________________\n\nThese dogs deserve all of our attention, and in Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Organization, we are committed to our adopters and our dogs equally. We offer full disclosure and hope to make the best matches possible. Please know our adoption fees never cover our expenses. We rely on the generosity of our adopters and supporters to help us help the dogs. \n\nOur rescue is only in the business of offering full disclosure to adopters, and expects and hopes to engage your questions and concerns fully. We owe it to the dogs we rescue and all the wonderful families/adopters who might consider welcoming our charges into their hearts and home. Our dogs are waiting for that ideal forever home where they will be cherished as deserving family members. It's sad these second chances are even necessary for these dogs, but we are committed to them and will devote the time and energy to their re-homing, and not just move them to save more dogs. We diligently and responsibly seek good matches, as we don't want to re-home the dog again. These animals have already endured more than they should have, and through no fault of their own. It behooves us to be honest and forthright, and we appreciate the same in return from applicants. It's that winning combination of reciprocal trust and respect that allows for successful placements to be made. Happy adopters translate to happy dogs, and that's our goal! \n\n\n",

She is a Senior Citizen whose favorite past times are curling up in her bed or beside her foster mom on the couch where she can get lots of gentle scratches behind her ears. Lulu loves to go on short walks with her tail wagging the whole time (and wagging double-time when she meets a person or another dog!)  \n\nLike many Shih Tzus, Lulu has been diagnosed with dry-eye and will need eye drops twice a day for the rest of her life. Lulu\u2019s foster mom says Lulu has no problems getting the eye drops and takes them patiently without complaint. Her foster mom also says that she may have limited vision, but she gets around very well once she has checked out a space.\n\nWe would like to have Lulu adopted around the Baltimore area. She will come up to date on her shots and microchipped. She is not yet spayed, but we will pay the costs associated with the procedure at a facility we approve of or choose. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting her, please fill out an online application on our website wingsoflovekuwait.com. We will then contact you to conduct a home visit and, once you are approved, a $100 deposit is required.\n",

Things got too hectic at my household and I was really hoping for a calmer lifestyle.\n\nI'm crate trained and enjoy being in my \"man cave\" when I need some time to myself.  I LOVE taking walks and sniffing everything I find along the way.  BUT, there's one thing that scares me - it is things with moving wheels.  We are working really hard to help me get over my fear...I have no issues with cars idling or parked, but moving past me is pretty scary.  Could it be the wheels?\n\nGiven that fear, my ideal home would be one with a really big yard away from the road.  Until I get over my fears, walks along a road would not be appreciated.  I'm a lovely boy...I just need someone to help me overcome my fears.\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

Once I warm up to you, I enjoy following you around and doing a little happy dance. An ideal home for me would be a quiet home with no pets or just a single smaller dog or cat. I came from a hoarding situation and did not get enough attention as a young dog so i can be wary of new people. I am potty trained, and will go on a puppy pad, but when I get really excited I leak. Oh my! I'm really working on that. I have learned to enjoy car rides and I'm working on leash training. I can act pretty scared, I guess I am still a bit afraid, but once I am in your arms, I really want affection. I realize I have a way to go to be a perfect companion, but I really do love my people once I get to know them. I need a permanent home with a patient family who will continue to help me grow to enjoy new experiences. I know I can be a great companion to an understanding home. Visit with my foster mom and she can tell you more about my progress.",

            "description": "Abbey is a beautiful and sweet girl that loves people and playing with other pups! Abbey seems to be mid to high-energy. She knows how to sit on command and she does great with other dogs. This loving girl is ready for her forever home! \n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, at least one round of parvo distemper vaccine and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

She would be the greatest addition to any family looking for a pet that does not require a lot of exercise or training. She is up to date on all shots, spayed and microchipped. She is currently being treated for heartworms but don't worry, that won't affect her ability to give you unconditional love. Her adoption fee is $250 and is available for adoption in Houston, TX.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Red is a handsome, purebred heeler looking for a home that will provide him with plenty of exercise, stimulation, stability, and routine. He is a typical heeler who thrives with a job; without his needs met, he will become bored, destructive, and resort to unwanted behaviors. These dogs are incredibly smart and need someone with the energy to match theirs! Red has completed a basic obedience class at a local facility and loves to learn new things. He's even welcome back there with his adoptive family to make the transition into his new home go more smoothly! Red's favorite activity in the whole wide world is FETCH! Throwing a ball is the way to this guy's heart of gold. Long walks, consistent training, and games/puzzles are also essential to keeping him his happiest. Red needs a home without children, cats, and prefers to be the only dog. He also needs a human (or two) who are familiar and experienced with working breeds. He is a little reserved when meeting new people and a bit wary of strangers. He is NOT an apartment dog, or one to expect to lay on the couch all day. He IS a hiking buddy, adventure seeker, athletic phenomenon, and SO much fun! He has been passed around between a few different homes and is looking to for a final place to land with some pretty special people. Interested in adopting this pet?

            "description": "Norma has now been with us a little over 5 months - she has come a long way and we believe she is officially ready for her own family. Norma is a special little girl and deserves a very special family. Whomever gives her a chance at a new place to call home will have to be able to give her time to adjust in her new environment. She has now lived/co-existed with multiple other dogs for several months but we believe that she would be much happier as the Queen of the castle ? Other dogs tend to make her feel uncomfortable and she isn't her true self when she has to share confined space with other furry friends. She would love to be someone's one and only and provide as many snuggles as one could want. She has done amazingly well with a routine in her foster home. She LOVES toys, going for walks, car rides, snacks and the occasional pup cup ?\n\nNorma is house trained and crate trained but she would love to be allowed the ability to free roam in her forever home. She doesn't tear things up and does well just hanging out. She also would do well around older/respectful children. \n\nNorma has been prescribed a monthly medication to help her feel more relaxed and we believe this will be extremely beneficial for her as she transitions into her new. Her new family would need to continue this regimen but there is a possibility she could taper off of it once she's settled in. \n\nThis sweet girl deserves her own family and we are hoping 2021 can give her just that.

            "description": "Palomino is a handsome 6 year old Chihuahua mix who is looking for the perfect forever family. Palomino is a shy little guy who will need a very gentle and patient person to show him all the love he so deserves while he learns to trust and come around. Palomino would do best in a calm and quiet home with a single person as he can become very protective of his favorite person. Palomino gets along wonderfully with other dogs and would benefit greatly from another single calm but confident canine in his home. Palomino will likely need training, including house training, in his forever home. Palomino will need a home with a yard, no apartments please. Palomino is a sweet and gentle boy who just needs a very loving and patient family to come along and show him how good he can have it. Palomino is full grown at 11 pounds. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and vet checked. His adoption fee of $220 includes a complimentary vet visit. To potentially adopt him come to our shelter location at 1102 W Hatcher Rd in Phoenix 85021, open Tuesday to Sunday 11am to 6pm. --Covid update: To adhere to CDC guidelines, we are open for adoptions only at a max capacity of 15 people in the building at a time.

He does great with other dogs and children but doesn't do well with cats. He loves to go on walks, play with his foster siblings as well as just spend time cuddling with you. He is very smart and will use his foster siblings to help him get around. He is housebroken and kennel trained. He will need to go to a home with another dog that will be he eyes and guide him through life. \n\nApply for jackson at Tmldogrescue.com",

We are looking for homeowners this time around. No rental/apt living, we will verify.  We want kids to be young adults in thier teens. We are very particular with our power breed dogs. We want Carson to be raised and trained to be a good member of society. Do not apply for this dog if you can not commit to him for at least 15 years. Carsons personality is very laid back and go with the flow. He is fine with all the other dogs in his foster home and good with the cats too. He is happy, well socialized, playful, calm, curious and a total love bug.  Carson sleeps in a crate at night and his foster mom is currently working on housebreaking which is going great. He needs to be adopted in our relative area of the south bay or north orange county beach cities. No out of state or out of area, he needs to return to OUR vet for vaccines and be neutered when it's time. If you are interested in Carson visit our website at www.animalsrule.org and fill out our online application.",

I am working on gaining weight but will probably be under 50 lbs. I am still working on my confidence and will sometimes bark when I get nervous. I love to be with my people, play with toys and snuggle up. I love all people of all sizes and ages, I like other dogs but am still learning how to play with them. I am working on crate training but prefer to by with my human and working on potty training, I\u2019m not a fan of going outside if my person doesn\u2019t come with me!\n\nIf you would like to learn more about or meet Penny, please fill out an adoption application on our website at k9s4u.org under adopt a pet, then contact Jenna @ (815) 616-0939 once application is completed.\n#K9s4uPenny",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nCatahoulas are such smart dogs and this girl is so pretty on top of that too.  Debbie is about 6 months old and will be a medium sized girl when she\u2019s all grown up.  Her adoption fee is $175.\n\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

It took me just a few days to get used to people and accept the pats and cuddles everyone wanted to give me. These days I\u2019m behaving more and more like a pup, playing with my foster sibling, zooming around the yard, and playing with toys. They say I am\u00a0\u00a0peppy & playful, curious & sweet. \u00a0I still get a little scared sometimes because there\u2019s a lot I haven\u2019t seen or experienced before. I\u00a0love company and need a little \u00a0time to warm up to new noises and people. \u00a0I really want to be around people and will love you once I warm up!! \u00a0 I\u2019ve never had any accidents in the house though, and happily sleep all night in the office with my foster sibling. \u00a0I love playing outside in the snow- it one of my favorite things to do! \u00a0I can toss a toy in the snow, zoom around the fenced yard and play with the resident dog all day if I could! \u00a0Speaking of fences- I need a fenced yard- this whole leash thing is new and it is going to take some time, training and patience to get used to it. And I am the prettiest red ever- seriously gorgeous or so I have been told!!\n\nI am a really sweet, curious and fun dog! \u00a0I will greet you with a wagging tail and will love being with you. \u00a0I might take a little time to warm up, but I know I\u2019m going to be a wonderful pup for someone.\nIf you would like to meet Penny, please visit spotslaststop.org and fill out an application.",

            "description": "Buddy is currently at the Animal Friends Humane Society in Butler County, OH outside Cincinnati.  Buddy is a 7 year old sweet boy, but has confidence issues.  He was surrendered by his family who adopted him in 2018, and it is believed he was left outside most of the time.  He attaches quickly to his person, but needs someone who will force him out of his comfort zone so he feels more comfortable.  We are helping the shelter rehome him.  We have spent time with Buddy so can answer questions about him.  If interested please go to www.animalfriendshs.org and complete the application.  We are also happy to answer questions.  Susan can be reached at 513-582-4585 in the evening.",

We rescued her from a shelter, where she came in with a wound on her back so Tina will need more time for that to heal.\n\nShe does well with smaller dogs, but needs some time to build her confidence with high energy surroundings. \n\nWe cover all expenses, you provide the love. She's a super sweet lady and still very shy around humans and other dogs. A quiet home that can provide lots of patience and let her have the space needed as she opens up would be ideal.\n\nFoster application link below or e-mail us if you have any questions. ?\n(We are accepting Foster to Adopt applications for her as well.

Biker had a wobbly kneecap (technically, a medial patellar luxation) that was stabilized with a pin on September 30th. He is still recovering and has two short, at-home physiotherapy sessions a day to keep his knee flexible. It is possible that he will get some arthritis later in his life (or need further surgery on his knee) since the operation was not performed until he was four. \n\nBiker is taking two Flexadin Plus chewies a day to help to prevent that. JRTRO had a successful fundraiser for Biker\u2019s operation and we are happy to know that he is now playing more and enjoys enrichment games his foster mom. \n\n Biker is not a typical high-energy Jack Russell Terrier. He loves to sleep and to be in his comfy bed. In fact, he prefers to be home and in his bed most of the day. Biker had a dental and his teeth are all squeakie clean. We are hoping that his energy level will increase now as he may have had some discomfort.  \n\nBiker enjoys cautiously chasing squirrels in the backyard and to be there for most of his potty needs during the day. One walk on-leash down the street, just a short block, is enough for him, so that he can check out the neighbourhood for new smells. He is good when he meets other dogs. \n\nBiker was not potty trained when he arrived last May, which is unusual for an older dog, but he is doing very well now, and his foster mom reports there are few accidents. He is a timid dog and has some fears. He doesn\u2019t like cars and motorcycles (he is fostered in downtown Toronto), but is doing well with treats, which he now prefers to barking at the cars. \n\n. He should live with adults (older children only), people who are at home all or most of the day to give him company. Another dog in the house is not a good idea for Biker; he needs a quiet, calm environment where he can feel safe. A loving, understanding owner who would never raise their voice to Biker would be ideal. He will reward you with love, affection, and many cuddles!\n\n--------------------------------\nInterested? STEP 1: Fill out an application! http://russellrescue.org/adoption/\n\nNOTE: ONLY queries with a COMPLETED FORM will receive a reply due to the volume of requests for info we receive.\n---------------------------------\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nBiker is being lovingly fostered in Toronto, Ontario.\nApply to adopt him now: http://russellrescue.org/adoption/\n\nAdoption Fee: $400 for Biker\n\nPlease note: FILLING IN THE FORM DOES NOT COMMIT YOU TO ADOPTION, but we cannot start a conversation with you without it. http://russellrescue.org/adoption\n\nAFTER submitting the form we can answer your questions.

Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

            "description": "I am affectionately called the \"the lioness\" by some of the AGPR volunteers.  My name is Winnie and I'm one tough girl.  I may be five years old...maybe six...we don't know.  \n\nMy main goal in life is to protect my resources.  My people and property are very important to me.  When I am outside and one of those delivery trucks come up the driveway, I let everyone on the premises know an intruder is coming.  And I let the intruder know not to mess with any of my people.\n\nThe funny thing is that once I get to know you, I love you and enjoy being loved in return.  Because I am so protective, I really don't feel comfortable in a home with kids or in a home with an active social life.  My best Pyr friend here at the rescue is Kristoph.  He's a big boy and he knows how to play rough and tumble. But he also knows when to stop.  I love it!\n\nI would love an acre or two (or a hundred) of fenced in land to protect and some humans to love.  No city or the burbs for me.  I'm not a girl who wants to be paraded through a neighborhood meeting lots of other dogs and people.  I know there's the right home for me out there somewhere. Could it be yours?\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

ONLY OPEN THOSE WITH A FENCE\nThis supports all rescue dogs for vetting, foods and whatever they need. We are all volunteers.\n\nI AM A SMALL ADORABLE funny, cuddly,  friendly , fun PUG MIX,only  12 lbs., 8 months. I'm way cuter than my picture, really.  \n\n I was wondering the streets in Arkansas. My foster called all the vets, posted everywhere and in the meantime took me into their home and loved me. I know I had a family but after about 4 weeks nobody came for me. We checked twice for microchips, but I had none. So I went again to the vet and got all my vaccines to get ready to come to Rhode Island for my new life with you. My foster mom says I am a wonderful puppy and I have a zillion of other dogs to play with at her home. The vet says I am about 8 months old and I am in very good health. I'm told everyone who meets me wants to take me home, but I think my best home will be in Rhode Island ( but please have a coat ready or me). I will be arriving into Rhode Island on Friday, February 5 and eager to settle into my forever home. I have shown my foster mom that I am great with all her dogs. I love to run and play, so please have a fenced yard for me. I LOVE TOYS AND PLAYMATES. I am hoping my forever home has a playmate for me who is young enough to play with me and a family who LOVES TO CUDDLE TOO.\n\n If you think you can provide a great home, please file the application and the more you tell us the more we can figure out if this is a match for you.  ARLO, aka, Chug is a friendly male, about 8 months old and about 12 lbs.   We really don't know what he is a mix of so we say pug and chi, but that is a guess.  He is a handsome brindle.  We have no idea of his final size, so if that is an issue , then please do not apply.  We do expect our adopters to enroll in basic dog training and have adjuster our fees to enable that.\n\nIf you can provide a FABULOUS home please file our free application (see link above) and tell us why we should let you adopt our wonderful rescue.\nOnce we have reviewed your application and think it is a match we will notify you.  Please understand that as these dogs are fostered we do get to know them and have a good idea of their forever home. We do NOT save applications, but  you may put multiple names on one application.  We do not choose by a first come first serve basis.  So if the dog is still up on the site, consider the dog AVAILABLE.  We do take down quickly when adopted.  If you don't see any information you need to know, we probably don't have an answer....like cats...idk...\n\n\nAGAIN:  ADOPTION FEE:  $500.\nTO file an application COPY AND PASTE INTO BROWSER\nhttps://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/z6lHg73iSha9kO04\nor on the website:  www.justdoodlesandfriends.org\n\n\nOnce we have reviewed your application and think it is a match we will notify you.

            "description": "Lalo is very energetic! While she may be shy at first it won't last long! She loves to be outside and chase everything! She is a little over a year old and loves to play with the other dogs in her foster home. She is often running super fast in circles around the yard. Lalo is crate trained and no messes have been made in the house or in her crate. Since she is still a puppy at heart she will find any miscellaneous socks around the house. She would benefit from an active home with a big yard. Another active companion is a bonus! Due to her high energy level, Lalo is looking for a home with no cats or dogs under 30lbs. \n\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

She would be the bell of the ball walking down the street, she truly is a cutie! \n\nPERSONALITY & BEHAVIOR:\nDuchess is the sweetest, most affectionate and loving girl. She does very well with other dogs and has so much unconditional love for her humans. She would love to sit on your lap, get cuddles and shower you in kisses! We think her name is pawfect, because she's so sweet (and most likely will be spoiled like a duchess!). Being a Coonhound, she is also very smart and would be eager to learn any further obedience skills! Currently she is working hard on house training and is doing so well! \n\nAdditionally, she has been dewormed, given age appropriate vaccines, spayed and microchipped.  She's ready to become a part of your family today!\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information or are interested in this precious girl, please text 4-6 photo's of your interior/exterior home and yard (including fence if applicable) to Judy (423-718-0939).\n\n- - - \n\nPlease Note: Inquiries through Pet Finder may be slower to respond and the best form of communication/inquiry would be through text message at the number above. Thank you.\n\nSearch for \"A PAW AND A PRAYER DOG RESCUE\" on Facebook to see ALL our available dogs for adoption updated daily!",

But she does walk quite well on leash!\n\nContact us for more information, and visit our website to complete an adoption application form:\n\nwww.twodogfarms.com/adopt\n\nAdoption fees are $350.00.\n\ninfo@twodogfarms.com",

Deceptively lanky, he's still just a little dude, approximately 3.5 small bananas tall, and just around 20lbs. \n\nBear is currently in foster care after receiving a dental, to allow for some rest and relaxation.  And rest and relaxation seem to be Bear's M.O. This guy even came to us with his favorite blanket and green bucket to cuddle up in, which he sleeps in every night. \n\nBear is currently bunking with very young kids and two bigger dogs. He is content to coexist with both, though he isn't enamored with dogs who enjoy sudden face-to-face greetings (to be fair, it's pretty rude) and doesn't love his sleep spots disturbed so older kids and other dogs with a mind towards relaxing to the max would likely be the best fit. \n\nBear has proven to be very well adapted to the homebody life in his foster home. He has become foster mom's shadow, following her everywhere around the house. He enjoys some good scritches, and will never say \"No\" to a good lap for a nap. He's had no accidents at all (this could change with an adaptation period in a new home but it is clear he has been housetrained), and is good on leash or in the backyard (where I dare say we may have seen him do a sly zoomie on occasion). He's food motivated (soft food and treats) and knows \"sit.\" He rarely has barked in his foster home (once when someone knocked) and has been left uncrated in his bedroom when alone with no destructive behavior (he took a nap, as he's wont to do).\n\nOverall Bear is a real chill little dude looking for someone who will go all in with his chill little dude lifestyle. We don't think that's too much to ask. \n",

She's a beautiful dachshund mix with a gorgeous dapple coat.\n\nShe is spayed, had cherry eye surgery on both eyes, and has recovered well.\n\nMillie loves spending her day snuggling and being the center of attention. In her past life, she lived outside 24/7. She's very happy to be inside the house getting lots of belly rubs,\n\nSmart Millie learned new things, being patient with other foster siblings at meal time, waiting for her turn for attention and learning to walk on leash (which she loves).\n\nShe sleeps through the night in her own bed, and is potty trained. Millie gets along with everyone, and other dogs, but she is very confident and thinks of herself as the alpha.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application at: www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/adoption-application to be pre-approved to adopt",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nTyson is right about 11 weeks old and simply adorable.  We know he\u2019s a mixed breed and with those stubby legs, who knows what that mix might be.  His adoption fee is $225.\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

She is two months old in about 10 pounds. She is blind but does very well. She will do better with another dog in the home or someone home most of the time to help her get adjusted to her new home. She is good with other dogs and will be good with older kids. She is working on her leash and potty trainingm good with kids, dogs, and cats. \nSylvia s have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Sylvia S? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Sylvia S.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Sylvia S the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Her kisses are soft and she takes food from your hand very gently. -Nina does not bark -Nina is good with dogs (but does not engage in play) -Nina is good with our cat -Nina was good with a friend's child -She is very mellow -She is crate trained -Nina LOVES peanut butter; this will be a good training aid! Areas to work on: -Nina is good with all creatures but does not initiate attention, perhaps due to anxiety -Nina goes to the bathroom outside but is too scared to leave her bed and living room area to walk out on her own. We carry her out to use the restroom but she walks back in the house herself. -Nina is must eat only soft/wet food. -Nina is reserved and cautious but has been willing to play a little with stuffed babies -Nina will likely blossom over time but progress may be slow so a patient adopter/foster would be best.

She can be very dog selective so it is mandatory for her to meet any other dog in the home prior to adoption. She would do best with a calmer dog. She can be cautious of men so she must meet any men in the home prior to adoption. **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. You can include multiple animals you are interested in on one application. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

When he was young, Moose had little contact with people, so up to now, he's been shy and sometimes aloof. He accepts touch and petting, but given the opportunity, he may move away. He's never growled or shown any type of aggression. Moose is more comfortable with women, housetrained and leash trained. He loves to play, run and frolic with other dogs and to play keep away with his toys! Moose will do best with an owner who has experience in helping undersocialized dogs blossom. Bring your entire family to visit this special boy! Kids age 12 or older.",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Little Scotty is a handsome 2-month-old boy who currently weighs about 11 pounds. We think he will grow to be 45 to 55 pounds as an adult. A perfect day for Scotty would include a trip to puppy socialization class, a nice walk with his favorite person, and lots of cuddles. Scotty's adoption fee is $350 and he is a SHELTER HERO! Which means 100% of his adoption fee goes towards other animals in the shelter. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Scotty or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the PUPPY'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

This amazing guy was owner surrendered to us recently because he was too interested in the kitty. His original family fell on hard times during the pandemic and gave him to friends that had a kitty. He is so handsome, playful, fun and loves doggy daycare!  He loves life and cuddling on the couch is absolutely magical. He likes to help you cook, if you will let him, and he can find every morsel that you drop. He is learning commands, walks very well on a leash, but is strong and does try to pull at first, and loves to ride in a car. He will try to get out with you, just in case you need help, and riding  shotgun is super fun!  He is housebroken and crate trained. He loves to play with friends and take leisurely strolls patrolling the yard. He ABSOLUTELY ADORES TOYS, especially those that squeak and crinkle. You will most likely find him in a toy box, if given the chance.  His other favorite is snuggling with you whenever he can. He has an adorable personality, especially once he gets to know you and settles in. He can be a little shy at first, but give him a second and he will follow your lead, especially if you have treats! He loves ice cream outings, sitting by the bonfire and being your very best friend in the whole world.  He can get over a shorter fence, so leash walking or a 6 ft fence would be required. \n\nIf you are interested in this adorable, loving, fun man, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Zeke\nBreed:  Lab mix\nGender:  Male           \nAge:  1 1/2 years old  \nWeight: 65 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative and on Heartworm prevention. Will be retested prior to transport\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  No, way too interested. \nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, He has NOT been tested with infants or toddlers, so proper supervision and introductions would be required. He lived with small children with his original family and middle age children with his second family. \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.

We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

She can be a little shy but will do great with older children loves people and other dogs. She is crate train but would like an active family that she can go out and do activities with. She does need work on her potty and leash training as well\n\nBetty S have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Betty S? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Betty S.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Betty S the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Ari (like Ariana Grande). I am a husky mix and am a little over 1 yr old. I am looking to find a family who will love me and take good care of me. I am still a puppy so I need a family that will be able to help me learn a few things. I still like to chew things so I will need to have chew toys or I'll find your shoes, slippers or your coffee table to chew on. I do mouth but usually play or to just get attention. When my foster family eats at the table, I really just want to be with them and will try to get their food. They are working with me on trying to get me to stay out of the kitchen when they eat but it is so hard, the food just smells so very good. I also like to put my paws up on the counter so, if you have any food up there, I will find it and eat it. I am really good on a leash. I have met a few dogs in my neigbourhood and haven't met one I don't like. I just want to play with them. My foster family has 2 cats. I don't realize that I am really big (compared to them) and I guess I scare them away with my size and enthusiasum. I do chase them when they run but I just want to play. My foster parents are working on my cat manners. At night, I like to sleep with my foster parents. I usually sleep on the floor on a nice cozy bed but sometimes jump on the bed to snuggle. I don't usually stay too long. I have never had any accidents and can go through the whole night without having to be let out. I don't like being alone and cry when my foster family leaves but I like to be cozy in my kennel and will go in and out of it all day. I am crate trained. I am so excited to give all my love to my new family and can't wait to play with you. I need a house with a fence backyard please and not an apartment or condo as I have always had that and would not be a good downtown city dog. xoox With love, Ari",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at K-9adopt@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: TinBear\nEstimated Breed : Lab/Shepherd Mix\nApproximate Age: 2-3 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 96 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nThis 96 pounder is nothing but a big cuddlebug. TinBear would love to find a loving family that knows how to handle large dogs. He would need space to get his exercise, so an apartment setting is not ideal.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nLuigi is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 year\nWeight: ~37lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle (10-30 minutes) and will benefit from an adopter willing to continue to work on this.\nDog sociability: Frustrated/reactive with dogs on walks. He will bark/lunge/pull when he sees them and benefits from a confident handler. He has done well off-leash with some other dogs, but can be selective of his dog friends.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but he is mouthy (play bites) and jumpy, so only recommended for teenagers\nIdeal home: Luigi is a young active dog that will do well with an adopter committed to working on training for his adolescent behaviors and exhausting his energy in positive ways! Due to his leash behavior he would do best in a quieter neighborhood and he is not a match for a high-rise or elevator building. \n\nLuigi is the sweetest boy you'll ever meet! He is a one year old black lab who has nothing but love to give. He is energetic, outgoing and is always ready to play with anyone! Every morning he sets out on a mission to rest his head on everyone's laps to make sure everyone gets a bit of love. He is a dog that thrives with structure and training and will require this in his adopted home. He does well with knowing what to expect out of his day and having dedicated time for playtime, enrichment time and rest time. He will do well with an experienced handler who can continue to work on training! Give him time, acceptance, and some kibble and he'll love you forever.\n\nLuigi's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

We are invested in him getting the right home. We are looking for someone that has owned corsos before or a powerahouse breed. No young children for him.\nI am a big strong boy so I will be up for adoption after I go to training. I am a little to crazy over my ball and will not give it up. I lived with a 35lb female doodle and loved her and really miss having a playmate. There was a cat in the house which I did not pay attention to but cats are funny and each cat is different. I have meet a few small dogs and did fine even the nasty ones that barked and growled at me. I know basic commands and when excited I will pull on a leash pretty good. I have not been around kids so it a case by case. I am house trained and I am crate trained but I do not car3e for the crate and my train to challange you on whether or not I need to be in one. If you know the corso breed I would be a awesome dog for you but I am part corso we believe and great dane. The dane part is goofy but the corso prt is strong willed and I need a leader. I am 11 months old. So that means a huge mouthy puppy in a giant dogs body. We are working on the being mouthy and the ownership of the ball issue and leash work in training.www.azmastiffrescue.com",

He weighs 65 pounds and is up to date on all shots, neutered, and completed treatment for heartworms. \n\nThe shelter that he was taken to when he was found listed him as border collie cross, but I think he has some lab in there also.  I love the way his tail curls up into more than a full circle.\n\nAtticus enjoys wandering around outside and seeing what is going on.  Since he is young, he has a fair amount of energy, but is not hyper.  He has never tried to jump up on a person.\n\nWhen he left the shelter, he did not know what Sit, Down, etc meant.  He is now pretty good at sit and down.  He is learning to sit and wait until released when his meal is served.\n\nAtticus is completely house trained.  He enjoys curling up on the couch for an afternoon nap.  He gets along with the other two dogs at my house.  He has not shown any food aggression.\n\nThere are a couple of areas where Atticus still needs to improve.  He likes to counter surf.  Also, when he is in the front yard and trucks go by, he races along the fence line with them.\n\nAtticus can not wait to be with his forever family !\n\nFor an application, please email me and tell me a little bit about you. \n\nkaroline.carlson@gmail.com",

I am a blue heeler/Australian cattle dog mix with maybe some super mutt thrown in for extra spice!  I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I am a gentle soul and would need a quiet home/neighborhood to grow up in! have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for luke S? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting luke S.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and luke S the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

I\u2019m a very friendly girl with lots of love to give you!  I\u2019d be happy to share my new home with other dogs or kids and maybe cats.  I met one inside and sniffed at her and moved on but when I saw one outside, I wanted to follow him. I may need further introductions to cats of my new home ha some to figure out what I think of them.\n\nOther great things about me: I walk great on a leash, I don\u2019t jump on people unless they invite me to, I\u2019m potty trained and I take treats gently from you when they are offered.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to meet my new family!

Along with Catahoula and Malamute, there is also some Chihuhua (!) and Husky. Banjo is about 2-4 years old, 40 lbs and about 16\" at the shoulder. He is very sweet but very uncertain and reserved.  He has jumped a 4ft fence, so he needs a home with either a 6ft fence (no chain link) or someone who will take him on frequent walks and is not gone all day.  Children scare him.  He likes other dogs and he seems to prefer women. He is curious, but after two weeks he is just now starting to trust his foster mom.  He is a work in progress but we think he will be an awesome dog and a great companion in the right home. He has had all his vetting including neuter and microchip.  Banjo is being fostered in Baltimore County, MD. Covid restrictions may have an impact on the adoption process but we are doing our best to work with interested and suitable adopters.",

Gerkin is good with dogs and cats,,, she is timid and although has been in foster with children needs some time to warm up to people entering the house.

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I am a gentle soul and would need a quiet home/neighborhood to grow up in! have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Daisy S? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Daisy S.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Daisy S the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email jessalynL@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Chloe\nEstimated Breed : Lab/Great Pyrenees Mix\nApproximate Age: 2 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 86 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nChloe is a little scared, but a very sweet girl. She just raised some puppies, and now she deserves a loving home with a family that will treat her like a queen!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Bonny is a total sweetheart. She is a little shy at first, but once she warms up to you, she loves head and ear scratches as well as belly rubs. She does sleep a lot during the day, but when she is awake, she loves exploring outside and sniffs everything. She will also get a case of the zoomies about once a day, and runs around the house like a puppy. It is so cute! She has a quirky personality and will definitely make you smile. She is crate trained and house trained with a doggie door, but does occasionally have accidents. She gets along with other dogs and would do fine with older children (she's never been aggressive, but doesn't like quick movements she's not expecting.) She loves sleeping on a dog bed or in her crate. Bonny is around 13 years old. She takes thyroid medication twice a day in a pill pocket and thinks it's a treat! She is on prescription kidney food for early kidney disease and is heartworm positive. Because of her age and other health issues, treatment is not recommended and she just takes monthly HW prevention. If you'd like to give Bonny a retirement home, please apply at www.dfwbeaglebuddies.org/adopt!\n\nTo see more photos, please visit us at: www.facebook.com/dfwbeaglebuddies\n\nTo find out more about our adoption process, fees, and fill out an application, please visit our website: www.dfwbeaglebuddies.org/adopt\n\nIf you're not quite ready to adopt, please consider fostering! www.dfwbeaglebuddies.org/volunteer\n\nCan't adopt or foster?\nConsider making a donation toward care and supplies for the Beagles! www.dfwbeaglebuddies.org/donate\n\n1/31/21 3:58 PM",

These pictures are nothing compared to what that speckled face, soft coat and the flippy-floppiest of ears are like in real life! Simply gorgeous!\n\nSay hello to your next forever companion \"DEXTER\", the 7-month old, Blue Heller/Pit mix! Frankly, we think he is pawfecttt and here's why!\n\nPERSONALITY & BEHAVIOR:\nDexter is such a fun-loving, sweet and happy boy with a spring in his step! Honestly, he loves everyone --- but especially other doggy friends, cats and children! He is playful, adoring and loves to have fun! He would thrive with a family and is very keen to learn! Being younger, Dexter would need some additional training such as house-training, but is very intelligent and wants nothing but to eagerly please you! He's been working very hard with his foster mom and is now completely crate-trained!   \n\nDexter really is the sweetest dog with such unconditional love, check out his video playing with a kitty (more on our fb!). He is also very good at being attuned to your moods and will play or snooze when you want to!  \n\nAdditionally, he's been dewormed, up-to-date on shots, fixed and microchipped! He's ready to become a part of your family today!\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information or are interested in this precious boy, please text 4-6 photo's of your interior/exterior home and yard (including fence if applicable) to Liz 423-320-8989.\n\n- - - \n\nPlease Note: Inquiries through Pet Finder may be slower to respond and the best form of communication/inquiry would be through text message at the number above. Thank you.\n\nSearch for \"A PAW AND A PRAYER DOG RESCUE\" on Facebook to see ALL our available dogs for adoption updated daily!",

She is looking for an active home, with breed experience, that can keep her busy, challenged, & provide her a job to do. \n\nLucy is very high energy & will need daily mental & physical exercise. A regular walk won\u2019t cut it for this girl! We think she could even make a great hunting partner for the right owner. \n\nWe think Lucy will do well in a home with kids 5+ & another playful dog her size. She is not suitable for apartment living. \n\nThis is an adult dog and the adoption cost is $275, which covers microchip, age appropriate vaccines, and spaying or neutering.\n\n Come out to meet all of our adoptable animals today! ----------------------------------- \n\nThis dog is at Midlands Humane Society located at 1020 Railroad Avenue, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 Please email or call them at 712-396-2270 midlandshumanesociety@gmail.com http://midlandshumanesociety.org/ Hours of Operation:\nMonday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,Friday 12:00pm - 6:00pm Saturday 11:00am-5:00pm\nSunday 11:00am-3:00pm",

            "description": "Jazz is a 2.5 yr old attentive, cuddly, petite Border Collie mix who weighs about 32 lbs. Gorgeous, sweet and smart, Jazz loves her people and all the attention they are willing to provide.  She also loves being active outside.\n\nJazz is looking for a family that enjoys being outside as much as she does. She loves to go for walks, hikes, and will happily help supervise your gardening in summer. After a fun day of activity, she\u2019s happy to chill out with her family. Her resume includes experience as a home office manager, happily napping while you work or watching squirrels out the window for signs of pending invasion.  \n\nThe perfect family for Jazz will have a proven track record of helping dogs gain confidence.  She is not sure how to behave when meeting another dog while leashed. She may erupt into barking that sounds aggressive, but is likely based in fear. Jazz meets and plays with  new dogs well when both are off leash.  \n\nAs evidenced by her behavior on leash, Jazz is unsure of new situations and we want her to learn to look to her humans for direction.  Her foster family has been walking her in a gentle leader, which is helping.  Jazz\u2019s new family will need to enroll her in classes to help build a strong bond and help her know she is safe.\n\nJazz requires a fenced yard (with a preference for privacy fencing), and is not a candidate for invisible fencing. She would be best in an adult home because loud noises and unexpected events that can happen with children in the home can send her running to her crate or a safe space she has chosen in the house.\n\nFine as an only dog or with a friendly canine companion, Jazz is silly and playful, and very loving.  She adores her people and wants to be with them as much as possible. She currently logs many miles a day zooming around the yard with her canine foster brother.  Jazz prefers a kitty-free home. She is food motivated and very easy to train, and just needs the right family to commit to working with her.\n\nJazz is located in Minneapolis/St. Paul. If you think you're a good fit for Jazz, please fill out an application at hoabcr.org/how-to-adopt\n\nAs a foster-based rescue, we do not have a central facility to visit. Meet and greets with specific dogs are arranged once your adoption application (not an inquiry email through Petfinder) has been received, processed, and approved. We are located in Minnesota and adopt to an area 400 miles from Minneapolis/St. Paul.\n\nJazz's adoption fee is $350 + MN sales tax. She is spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations",

I have beautiful black/brown fur with a cute white patch on my chest. I love getting attention from people and I am a super smart boy who likes to learn new tricks. I do well on leash and I ride nicely in the car. I may do well with a calm dog like myself, but I don't like when dogs jump on me or stay in my face for too long, it makes me nervous! I haven't been around small children, so older kids and teens for me please! I haven't met any kitties yet either, so a feline-free home would be preferred! I appear to be house trained and I do well in a crate. Ideally, my new family will be excited to continue my positive reinforcement training as I have been really excelling with it. Please reach out if you feel like you might be the perfect home for me!",

She loves to be picked up and cuddled. She will also sit in your lap to cuddle or just lay next to you for a pet. She especially loves to get her belly rubbed. Playtime is very active. Her favorite activities are chasing a ball and tug-of-war. I believe she will be a water lover as she doesn't mind bath time. She has gotten good at using a puppy-pad in the home. She will also sit before being served her food or water. We are currently working on chewing toys rather than people during playtime. This is a normal puppy behavior and she has shown signs of being a quick learner.\n\nAbout Me:\n\nHi, my name is Snooty.\n\nMy nickname is Snoots because my foster people say that I am not a snooty puppy.\nI am super sweet and love cuddles. I nibble sometimes, but I am just playing. I also love to chew toys, since my teeth are still growing. I love laying in soft and cushiony spots. Most of all, I love being with my humans.",

            "description": "Molly is a 9-month old Boxer/Shepherd mix puppy who is as full of energy as she is love.  Molly was surrendered because she was not friendly with the resident cat, however if you are a cat-free household, there is so much to love about Molly.  Molly enjoys playing fetch, walking in the woods, and cuddling.  Molly knows a few commands and is wonderful on a leash.  Molly does well meeting strangers at home as long as she can meet them outside in the yard and not inside the house.  The person or family who falls in love with Molly and adopts her will need to be aware of Molly\u2019s household vigilance, and will need to provide gentle, positive training to help her be less protective and more personable.  Molly\u2019s shy temperament may require more than one visit by her potential adopters; she will do best in a home with dedicated humans who can provide her with structure, and continue her obedience training.  To make friends with Molly contact Tri-County Animal Rescue Center on Facebook, call 814-918-2032, or email: contactus@Tricounty-arc.org",

Once outside he pulls heavily. We attempted a dog meet and Oskar was fine from a distance. No concerning behavior so we approached another dog and his handler to initiate the meet.

Solicited attention and believes he is a lap dog and loves to hop up on handler to receive affection. Interested in toys, but did not take possession. \n1/15 (Per Staff) -- Oskar was very easy to leash and waslked well on our way outside. However, once he finished his business he rushed back to the kennels and started choking himself on the leash, he should be walked with a harness on. I had to step into the kennel to get him back in, he tried to get back out so i let him out, threw treats in and then was able to remove the leash.\n1/14 (Per Staff) -- Approached kennel to adjust kennel card. Oskar greeted me at kennel front, loose body and tail wagging. He was patient as if he was waiting for me to open the kennel door. \n1/14 (Per Vet) -- Friendly; BAR\n1/13 (Per APO) -- dog was not aggressive \n\nBITE DETAILS:\n1/31 - Bite was reported as one shallow puncture wound.

Drew a little blood and was treated with first aid kit. He was overstimulated by the 3 kids. Bite seemed unintentional and nonaggressive, he got very excited and mouthy and behaved very well with the kids before getting overexcited",

A few of his favorite things are: snuggling, cuddling, being near you, and playing with his toys! Peanut is the happiest boy. He makes all of us smile immediately! \n\nIn his previous home, Peanut has lived with a smaller dog and he did well around him! Peanut's energetic and loves to play so we do think that pups in the home should be interested in playing, too! We haven't seen him around kitties yet. If your kiddos have been asking for a puppy friend, Peanut may be perfect for them! \n\nHe has done very well with understanding house-training. Peanut is familiar with being crate-trained and has done well in it! He even likes to sleep in it. Sometimes he really misses you when you leave so please be willing to teach him that being alone is okay! He is a smart guy, we are sure he is capable of learning whatever you show him! \n\nPeanut's temperament is top-notch. He is so loving and just wants to be near you! He loves tennis balls, zooming, chewing on bones, and playing with interactive toys. \n\nDaily walks and interaction will be important for Peanut as he is still quite puppy-like! Give us a call at (219) 872-4499 to schedule an appointment to meet Peanut.",

            "description": "This dog is in Tennessee. Adoption Donation $200 if picked up in TN, $250 plus transport fee for out of state adoptions.\n\nKimber is excited to be someone's constant companion! She is a goofy 10-month-old Lab mix puppy who weighs about 45 pounds. She is sweet, playful and very food-motivated. Training should go quickly with some treats. Kimber is already crated trained and is working on house training and leash training. She knows how to use a doggie door but is still a puppy so a consistent schedule is key. She is good with other dogs and likes to run and play in a fenced yard. Her favorite spot is cuddled up next to you on the couch, or sleeping in bed with her family. Kimber loves playing fetch with stuffed squeaky toys and enjoys taking out the stuffing if given the chance. If you think Kimber sounds like the kind of fun you need in your life, please apply to adopt! Kimber will be ready to go home after 2/3/21.\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Leroy is a 7.5 year old red smooth dachshund. He is approximately 11.5 lbs. and is at a perfect weight.\n\nHe is sweet and has never met a person he didn't like. He does well with other friendly dogs when introduced slowly. \n\nHe lives to play ball and could play fetch all day long. He would be suitable around kids (8+), as well as men and women of all ages. He walks well on a leash and loves exercise but hates riding in the car. He would prefer a home that will let him sleep in bed with his humans. He would also prefer someone who is not gone long hours every day as he has some separation anxiety. \n\nHe recently had his dental and is ready for adoption. He had some slightly above normal liver values that may have been attributed to his dental disease, so we started him on a natural supplement. His forever home should repeat his blood work in about 3 months to confirm things have normalized.\n\nWhat's the catch with this perfect sweet boy? He needs work on potty training. He went inside the house for years and is now learning to connect the dots that he is supposed to go outside to do his business. This training will take time, although his amazing foster family is working overtime to teach him this.\n\nRequirements for Leroy's Forever Home:\n\nPatience and experience with potty training\nHome with a yard to reinforce potty training (a dog door would be fantastic)\nSomeone who likes throwing a ball everyday!\nFinancial ability to repeat his blood work at your vet\n\nDoes Leroy sound like the dog of your dreams? Please apply on our website to be considered:\n\nhttps://www.portlanddachshundrescue.org/adoptionform",

No family showed up to claim him as lost, and the rest is history.  He is now doing great in his foster home with his foster family which includes other dogs, cats, birds and three human boy siblings.   Krowa definitely has some border collie instincts, mixed with who knows what but he is definitely adorable.\nKrowa still has a little vetting to go to be ready for adoption but will be available after February 10th.\n  If you think he is the boy for you, please follow our procedures listed below.\n1. on line application\n2. vet and reference check\n3. phone call\n4. home visit\n5 meet and greet\n6. adoption\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again. No more hurt or fear.\n\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2",

Bully came to PAWS Atlanta after his human died.  He had some medical stuff we had to work out and will need a special low-fat diet and medication for IBS likely for the rest of his life.  He was way too skinny when we sent Bully into foster, but he's steadily gained weight and is now so much healthier! Bully is playful and active and slightly clumsy. Bully loves people, food and toys, in that order.  He does not love crates, being put into a crate, anything to do with a crate or even seeing photos online of crates.  Bully has absolutely thrived in his foster home and is house-trained and  a polite, nondestructive guest.  This boy is  going to be someone's heart dog. If you think that someone might be you, send in an application and we'll set up a meet-up!",

She loves to lay on her dog bed and enjoy being with people. She is great with other dogs but not so much with cats. Nala is a year old and is healthy, HW negative and is scheduled for her spay this coming week. While we don't know her breeds she looks like a petite carolina dog /golden mix. We think she is fabulous!\n\nNala is currently in TN but will be transported north to New England for adoption. The adoption donation is $500 which includes a health certificate and costs for her transport north.\n\n*Unless stated otherwise, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, on flea/tick product and heart worm prevention medicine (if older than 5 months) and micro chipped prior to adoption.\n\n*Please note that while we do our best to accurately state the breed or breed mix of a dog, we often have very limited information to draw from. Identifying the breed without pedigrees and information on heritage can be very challenging!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please go to www.angelsamongusanimalrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Thank you!\n\nMassachusett's Residents: Effective September 28, 2017 a Quarantine Fee of $120 will be required  (in addition to the adoption fee) to adopt a dog that has been Quarantined. Massachusetts mandates that all dogs entering MA shall be quarantined for 48 hours in a state approved facility.",

If interested in adoption Scatman, please submit an application at socorescue.com. (no phone calls please.)***\n\nScatman is a 3 month old Lab/Bulldog mix who came to our rescue as an owner surrender along with his siblings. They previously lived in filth, weren't given proper care and most likely would have perished if they hadn't been rescued.\n\nScatman is a very friendly and playful pup. He loves romping around and exploring new things and is always up for whatever game his siblings want to play. We expect Scatman to grow to approx 60lbs based off the size of their mother (who the owner kept).\n\nScatman is up to date on his first year vaccinations, has been de-wormed, treated against parasites and started on his monthly preventatives. Scatman's adopter must agree to having him neuter once he reaches 6 months of age and provide proof of such to our rescue. He will need all of his basic training.",

The humans at the shelter are always telling me that I have the absolutely best smile and that they love me so much! \n\nI'm about one year old and am neutered. I'm a super energetic and fun boy! I'd love a family who is active and likes to play! Once I am done playing, I love to curl up on your lap - yes, I believe I AM a lap dog and believe that I DO fit perfectly! - for an afternoon nap! \n\nI have done pretty well with other friendly dogs and have also been respectful around dog-savvy kitties! If your kiddos have been around doggies before, we may be a good fit! I have a higher energy level so it would be cool if they would like to play with me!  \n\nI consider myself quite intelligent! I know how to sit, come, lay down, stay and speak! I know basic manners but please be willing to continue to teach me so I can learn even more! Going for walks, cuddling, riding shotgun with you, and chewing on Kong toys are a few things that I really like. \n\nPlease call the shelter at (219) 872-4499 to schedule an appointment to meet me. Love, Brock.",

He is quick to run up to us for a greeting. He'll let us hold him, but is very active and would usually rather be able to run and play. Sometimes, he'll let us know he is done playing by climbing up into a lap and falling quickly to sleep. He is a tiny little guy right now, and you'll definitely want to kiss his puppy face.\n\nAbout Me:\nHi, my name is Soni and I love cuddles. My foster care people say my face is so adorable. I am really active and love to play tug of war and throw the ball. I love to chew toys too. Mostly I just love attention from my humans and my sister. Sometimes I get a little too wild for my sister, but I think it is so fun when she chases after me to get the toy I stole. When I am not playing, I love to find comfortable spots to nap. I hope to find a loving family and get lots of attention and playtime.",

            "description": "Meet Patience (or Paddy) - a loveable puppy who is right under a year old and who's curiosity knows no end. \n\n\nThis beautiful girl may be deaf but she knows how to dog with the best of them! Patience loves tennis balls and will play fetch for hours. (Seriously, she loves a ball.) Caring for a deaf dog isn't much different than any other pup -- and Patience makes it easy as she only has eyes for her humans.\n\nIt's hard not to fall in love with this sweetheart because she loves every human she meets - including children. Patience is, however, particular with her furry friends but she does get along with her foster siblings well and they love playing in the yard. Patience is crate trained, house trained and has learned to sit. We're still figuring out the leash for long walks but picking it up pretty fast. She definitely has lots of puppy energy but once she's comfortable she also enjoys some good chill time. Patience will need a family/home that is dedicated to her as she has been bounced around a lot and is deserving of her forever home. \n\nIf you are interested in me, click Apply for Adoption!\n\nIf you're on Adopt-A-Pet or PetFinder, please visit https://www.hopeanimals.org/ to apply!\n\n\n** Please note that due to COVID-19 and stay at home orders, we are not having our usual adoption events.

            "description": "We admit being the fans of the \u201cLongmire\u201d TV series based on author Craig Johnson\u2019s books. We thought the most fitting name for this young 2 year old, male weimaraner can only be named after Absaroka County Deputy Sheriff Branch Connally. Branch is athletic, tall, long legged, full tail, still has his dew claws, handsome, quiet guy but he can be a talker\u2026\u2026yes, yes, yes, we are talking about our Husker Weim Rescue, Inc. foster weimaraner pup Branch.  \nBranch enjoys 2 full meals a day, when we leave. he gets a frozen treat of a kong or a filled bone of dogfood, cottage cheese, or other good treats capped with peanut butter. A chewbone, or a dental chew rounds out his treat time. Enjoying his food & treats so much, he gets them behind a dog gate or in his secure place in the house that has windows to watch the outside world. It also includes a couch where he can keep track of the activity through the house. \nFirst thing in the morning, before going to bed, after eating a meal or whenever you come back home, it is time to go potty.  Sometimes when you open the back door, he will stick his head out & you can see him think, \u201cman it\u2019s really cold\u201d so you need to step outside, tell him go potty then he will take off to take care of business. The same cues happen when he sees the cats wander in the neighbor\u2019s yard. Outside, he takes off barking (sounding all tough), he heads to the corner of the yard, stands at point with this tail curled & head held high. Call his name, if he chooses to ignore, a clap of your hands with \u201cBranch\u201d come will bring him back into the house.  \nLeash training was not a priority (heartworm positive, he was on quiet time), so he walked with his foster mom back & forth in the back yard. He pulls strong with collar & leash so recommend a harness.  Now healthy, tossing a large chuck it ball does not convince Branch to pick it up & return so foster mom gets in her fitness steps. He has learned to love hopping through the snow or performing zoomies in good weather. Branch has surprised us with understanding the commands of sit, place, wait & stay.  Give the command of lay, he sits, thinks then gives you his paw. With his meal, he gets excited, so he stands or hops on his back 2 legs, command of sit with a hand signal, wait, put the food down, give him the ok, then he eats\u2026but watch the drool.\nBranch\u2019s has a good nose. First foster dog that learned to open the drawer holding our garbage can (quietly) lift certain pieces of garbage out and take them to his secure area. Prevention is putting a baby gate against the drawer. Because of that darn good nose, a few kitchen items have been partially eaten so now the dishes & cooking utensils are rinsed, put away in the dishwasher under Branch\u2019s fine supervision.  The disinfecting wipes come out, countertops, kitchen drawers, appliances are wiped down, stove top is washed off & the washcloth & dishtowel are put away OUT OF REACH.  I did mention the long legs equal a long reach. You will still find him in the kitchen, the nose is checking the counter, but we have put everything away. The best car rider ever, he makes himself comfortable or will sit to watch the world go by while you drive.  Branch is learning to cuddle with foster mom on the couch but needs to learn his space. Getting on the couch he sometimes landed on top of your lap, he will cuddle with his head on your shoulder with his paws wrapped over your lap. When he melts into you, he will make your heart melt. There are times when you want him to cuddle but he it\u2019s a no go.  He is still a work in progress. A perfect home?  Weimaraner knowledge, understanding he will start talking to you if he feels you ignore him, give him exercise, no little kids (the littles would be knocked down) he is good with other social dogs but no little ones that might make him think of cats & no, no, no cats.  Interested, fill out the adoption application at huskerweimrescue.com. When submitted, email us at huskerweimrescue@gmail.com & our volunteers will get to work processing your application. \n",

            "description": "Carla is a doll! She was shy at first in the interaction room, but we waited patiently and she came over to us and warmed up pretty quickly. She was not interested in treats, she wanted our love! She walks on the leash pretty well, but she wasn't interested in jumping into my car. We had to pick up all 60 something pounds of her! However, once she got into the car, she was all set. She laid down and didn't move a muscle. We got home and she loved exploring the yard. We gave her a bath and I was fully prepared to be drenched, but she sat patiently and was a dream! I have a dog and they were good together for several hours, but my dog wasn't happy to share my attention. Carla may be better suited as an only dog or with a dog that is less territorial than mine. She slept in the crate all night without a sound! Once she got settled in, she was happy to lounge on the couch or floor. She did not beg when we ate and seemed to be nearly if not totally house trained. She would be a fantastic addition to someone's family. Please adopt Carla!! She deserves it and so do you. :) Laid back Loving Sweet Did okay with another dog but might need to be only dog house trained Enjoys cuddling Partially leash trained minds manners likes car ride Carla is a love bug",

            "description": "Dickens is a 7 month old, dapple dachshund. He is a \"tweenie\" and is already 14lbs (although he could stand to lose a pound according to the vet).\n\nThis boy is very sweet but was born during the pandemic and has not been socialized with people or other dogs. He is looking for a home that has experience with anxious dogs who can be patient with him. We think he was fed table scraps, or at least a lot of dog treats, which is why he is uninterested in most dog food. His foster is working on giving him fresh delicious food that is healthy (We're happy to report he does like broccoli). His forever home will have to continue feeding fresh food and watching his weight.\n\nHe is in the \"chewing\" phase of his puppy hood, so all furniture look like big, fun toys to him. In addition, he is still working on his potty training (He often poops inside when it's cold or wet). Finally, Dickens is a barker- A loud one at that. He barks whenever he wants something or just wants your attention.\n\nIn summary, this lovable, sweet and playful boy is not a first-time starter dog (even though he's adorable).\n\nRequirements:\n1) Home with a securely fenced yard (no apartments will be considered due to his barking)\n2) No young children (9+ years) in the home since he is a nervous dog and we don't know if he will nip.\n3) The other dog(s) in the home should be calm, well-adjusted and easy going. Placing him with another anxious dog would only increase his own nervous behavior.\n4) New owner should be committed to enrolling Dickens in training classes to continue his socialization and behavioral work\n5) No first-time dog owners as this dog needs someone who has experience with dogs and/or the unique challenges of the breed\n\n\nIf you wish to be considered, please apply on our website:\n\nhttps://www.portlanddachshundrescue.org/adoptionform\n\nPlease note that if you apply but do not meet the criteria listed above, you will not hear back from us telling you your application was unsuccessful.",

Instead, Suzie, a Mountain Cur mix,  is incredibly soft and gentle.  She is timid with strangers and needs time to build trust with new people.  (Children under the age of 5 would be too much for her.)  Once Suzie knows you, she is sweetly affection-seeking. She enjoys leisurely strolls outside and doesn't pull on the leash.  Suzie is housebroken and always keeps a clean kennel overnight. Suzie does have a benign angiolipoma on her face which, due to placement, cannot be removed. It is possible that this mass could grow larger but it is benign. Because Suzie was transferred in from another rescue, we are unsure of her history or if she's lived with other animals before.  Suzie would love a quiet home to help her gain confidence.  Could it be yours?\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered. Dogs 3 months and older are micro-chipped.",

This perfect combination makes it easy for her to excel when obedience training and already knows basic commands such as sit, lay down, stay (for short periods), shake, and is working hard on leash manners. She's also already a pro at house-training and using the crate! \n\nGeorgia LOVES dogs and gets along with all she has been around! She's very social and friendly and tolerates cats (doesn't appear overly interested in them). She ADORES playing fetch and tug of war and has a funny, quirky and affectionate personality! \n\n*She's always been a hard worker and has done so well in her foster home, however, she can appear a bit skittish at times and for that reason will need consistent training/guidance when interacting/meeting children. We recommend this to be a slow process to help ease her into a new lifestyle and really grow into her full potential! \n\nFor the moment, Georgia would do better in the house with NO children.   \n. \nIf you\u2019d like more information or are interested in this precious girl, please text 4-6 photo's of your interior/exterior home and yard (including fence if applicable) to Liz at 423-320-8989.\n\n- - - \n\nPlease Note: Inquiries through Pet Finder may be slower to respond and the best form of communication/inquiry would be through text message at the number above. Thank you.\n\nSearch for \"A PAW AND A PRAYER DOG RESCUE\" on Facebook to see ALL our available dogs for adoption updated daily!",

I am a bit mouthy for I am still a puppy that needs lots of training to become the best boy you've ever had. I am high energy so I will need plenty of exercise (back fenced in yard preferably) . I love playing fetch but tug of war is my absolute favorite! If you're interested in me, please call the Tullahoma Animal Shelter to schedule an appointment to come and meet me!",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nTusk is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~2 years \nWeight: ~49lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be kept to a strict schedule \nCrate trained: Working on it! He takes time to settle (~10 minutes) and would benefit from continued training for this\nDog sociability: Friendly! Lives with two dogs in his foster home and has been doing well. He is playful with the medium sized dog his age and is respectful with the senior chihuahua. \nCat sociability: \nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Tusk is pretty adaptable to most living spaces, but would prefer to not live in a high-rise/elevator building. \n\nTusk is a gentle boy who loves to please. His cuddles are A+ and with fur that soft you'll never want to stop petting him and he won't oppose. He is very playful with the young resident dog and very gentle and respectful of the senior resident dog. He self entertains with toys and bones if no one will play with him. He's smart and would love to expand his trick vocabulary. He has some tiny white patches of fur on his head and neck that looks like someone dripped paint on him and it is the cutest thing. Tusk has perfected the puppy dog eyes and he deserves everything he wants! \n\nTusk's adoption fee is 300. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. Tusk will be neutered on 3/18.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "Trixie is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nTrixie is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~6 months\nWeight: ~27lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! She will need to be kept to a strict schedule\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes time to settle (10-30 minutes) and would benefit from continued training\nDog sociability: Friendly! Lives with a dog in her foster home and has been doing well.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Friendly with kids!\nIdeal home: Trixie is an active puppy looking for a home that can keep her mentally/physically stimulated. She is nervous on walks, so she will do best in a quieter neighborhood where she can work on this or with a backyard. She would love a playful dog pal in her home or access to doggy daycare to expel some of her puppy energy.\n\nTrixie is a whole lot of fun in a small spotted package! She loves to play with her ball in the yard and is learning fetch. She's been learning all kinds of things here at her foster home Sit, go to bed (crate), going outside to do her business. She's quite quick running in the yard which is a fun sight to see. She likes to play with her senior foster dog friend and would love a playful dog to wrestle with her in her forever home, or nearby friends. \n\nOne Tail at a Time requires that puppies 6 months and under are enrolled in a positive reinforcement training class within 2 weeks of adoption at the adopter's expense.\n\nTrixie's adoption fee is 350. She will be spayed on a future date (3/4/21) and a 50 refundable spay deposit will be required. She is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. We recommended she be retested for heart worm disease when she is about 9 months - 1 year which would be the adopter's responsibility. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Bella Rose was not wearing a collar, and she was not microchipped.\n\nBella Rose has a shiny dark brown/brindle short smooth coat with a large patch of white on her chest, a few white toes on her paws, a long tail, and a beautiful face with hopeful trusting eyes, a black button nose, and large semi-erect ears.\n\nBella Rose has an affectionate disposition and a friendly 'Type A' outgoing  personality. \n\nBella Rose has a rather stocky physique but isn't a large dog when you see her in person.  She weighed 49.6 lbs when she entered our shelter in August 2020 but may have gained a few pounds since then.  Bella Rose is fairly strong on a leash (especially when she sees a cat nearby).  \n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Bella Rose (Aster/Pup Pup) was held for three days so that her family would have an opportunity to reclaim her but nobody came looking for her :(\n\nSince she was not reclaimed, Bella Rose/Aster went home with a foster family on August 8, 2020 who planned to adopt her after she was spayed.\n\nBut Bella Rose was returned by her tearful foster family on January 29, 2021 because she wasn't doing well with a young child in their household.  They told us that Bella Rose was the sweetest dog ever and it broke their hearts to bring her back to a shelter environment after enjoying a real home for nearly five months.  We hope that someone with no small children will fall in love with Bella Rose and adopt her as soon as she is spayed.\n\nBella Rose has been given rabies vaccine and has tested negative for heartworm.  She will be spayed in the near future.\n",

Sure, Bruiser might be a little scared at first but he warms up quickly. He LOVES people, especially when they have treats for him!  Bruiser is very treat-motivated so he's eager to learn more tricks.  He already sits on command and is housebroken.  Bruiser lived with a female dog of similar size, as well as cats.  He does try to play with the cats, so he might be overwhelming for lazy or senior felines.  Bruiser is seven years old, but you'd never know it. He's in great shape and has a real zest for life.  We think he's the bees knees and know you will too!\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered. Dogs 3 months and older are micro-chipped.",

            "description": "Smokey is an 8 month old Lab mix who wants nothing more in life than snuggles and a ball. He is 40 pounds and just about full grown. He gets along very well with other dogs. He lives with a dog about his size and a dachshund in a wheelchair and adapts his play style to suit to both of them. We do not know about cats. \nHe knows sit, is kennel trained, potty trained, and has walked incredibly well on a leash since the day we got him. He is currently being trained on how to properly heel, as opposed to the loose leash walking near you he has been doing. He stills gets distracted by other dogs on walks but is by no means unmanageable walking past them, so he will need help with that. He is learning to wait at the door to go outside instead of rushing the door and knocking someone over. Smokey wants to please. He learned to sit and wait to be released to eat his food over 4 meals. He is a very trainable dog. He is highly motivated by praise, toys, and food so you have many options for continuing his training. He is energetic but just scratch his head or his ear a little bit and he immediately turns off and just wants to snuggle on the couch with you. He likes to be with people but will go lay by himself in the other room if he wants. We have seen no signs of separation anxiety. He will play fetch with you until your arms falls off and then hit you with those puppy dog eyes so you will throw with your other hand. \nIf you are interested in this cute guy, fill out our adoption application at huskerweimrescue.com.  Please drop us an email at huskerweimrescue@gmail.com to let us know that you have applied and our volunteers will start processing your application.  \n",

            "description": "Hey Boo Boo! Are you looking for your Yogi Bear? Two-year-old Boo Boo is a petite peanut of a dog.  She is fully grown at 16lbs.  Boo Boo is a beagle/ hound mix.  She is uncertain but very tolerant at first. Once Boo Boo is outside and comfy, she becomes a lot more puppy-like.  She loves tennis balls, romping around and getting attention from her person.  Boo Boo is accustomed to other dogs around her size. Because she was transferred in from another rescue, we've never seen her with cats or children.  We don't know how she is in a home but we do know that Boo Boo likely wasn't walked on a leash.  She is confused by the concept and will need training. Boo Boo may have booboos in her new home, but we hope her new owners are understanding!\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays.

Oopsie can be nervous in new situations but quickly warms up and demands cuddles and affection.  She likes being pet and will stand on her hind legs to get closer to you.  Oopsie was transferred in from another rescue, so we're unsure of her history.  She does seem to like other dogs. We've never seen her around cats or children. Oopsie has kept a clean kennel overnight but initially may have accidents in a new home.  Although Oopsie loves being outside, she still is learning to get comfortable on a leash. Luckily, Oopsie weighs 26lbs, so she's very easy to manage. Oopsie is heartworm positive and has received her first treatment. The 2nd and 3rd treatments will be provided by Friendship to Oopsie's adopter at no additional fee.  We predict great things for Oopsie.  Can you help her realize them?\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED.

Goofs' name may imply that she's a silly goose, but she's quite docile and gentle.  She is timid at first but quickly adjusts to new people.  Goofs loves affection and being pet.  She was transferred in from another rescue, so we've never seen her in a home or with children or cats.  We do know that Goofs was seldom walked on a leash before and is very confused about the concept. She will need basic training to help with this.  Goofs may have accidents in a new environment.  Give her age and eagerness to please, we're hoping training will come easily to Goofs.  \n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered. Dogs 3 months and older are micro-chipped.",

O.K. so I\u2019m a bit goofy looking and I have a \u201csnaggletooth\u201d and my leg bows out but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I have a lovely personality and once you get to know me you'll think I'm adorable and that snaggletooth will melt your heart! I am a well-mannered gentleman, a lover and a snuggler. I am 6 years old and I weigh 10 lbs. I am friendly and I get along with other dogs but I am more of a people dog. I love to snuggle up with my humans and if there is an available blanket around you can find me snuggled in it. I may be already housebroken as I have never had an accident in my crate or inside my foster home. I am just a very nice boy looking for a loving forever home.\n\nBirthdate: 1/17/2015\nWeight: 10 lbs.\n",

Get me out of here please!!\n\nClearly I'm adorable... but I'm 1/2 the size of my sisters Aloha and Mahalo and I really need some peace and quiet. They are a LOT to take for a tiny dude like me. I know I'll start to grow big soon, but for now, I'm kind of tiny. At first, they were hogging all the food but foster mama has made sure I get plenty of it now so I'm doing much better. My foster mama is the best.\n\nI'm a very, very snuggly, sweet little dude. I like to lay on your lap and have you pet my head and say nice things to me. I like to play too but not as much as I like to be snuggled.\n\nI'm hoping you'll find me cute and will want to fill out an application for me... remember... I really need to get away from these 2 crazy girls. Please help a pupper out...\n\nShaka is a male Lab mix (we think) and was born around 11/22/20 and currently weighs about 4 pounds.",

            "description": "Meet our good ole' country boy, Clyde! Clyde is a beautiful 3 year old bluetick coonhound from Mississippi who finds our big city animal shelter a little overwhelming, and would like to come home with you, pretty please? He loves nothing more than to cuddle up with people and try to be a lap dog, a feat given that he is a big, tall boy! He enjoys people watching out the window. A bay window would be his dream come true! He currently has an ear infection and is undergoing treatment for heartworms, which our medical staff would be happy to speak with you about. \n\nClyde has shown some nervous behaviors while meeting other shelter dogs, and may prefer to be the only dog child in your life. If you do have another dog at home, we would like them to meet Clyde in our shelter before you take him home. Dogs have opinions, after all! Think you're ready to show handsome county boy Clyde the Pittsburgh sights? Take him home today!\n\nThank you for your interest in our adoptable animals! Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do require appointments to see our adoptable animals. Please complete the adoption application and a Customer Care Associate will be in contact with you. PLEASE NOTE: We ask that when you submit your application, that you are available to schedule an appointment within the next 24-48 hours.",

Once she's comfortable in her new environment, Bloopers starts to get silly! Bloopers will stand on her hind legs hoping for some pets.  She likes to be outside and might even grow to love toys.  Bloopers enjoys the company of other dogs but we've never seen her around cats or children.  (She was transferred in from another rescue so we do not know her history.)  We do know that although Bloopers enjoys the outdoors, she was not walked on a leash often.  She still is confused by leash-walking and would benefit from some basic training.  Bloopers may have accidents in her new home. She is full grown at 23.6lbs, so she's the perfect size for cuddling!\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered.

He needs to be the only canine resident as he does not like to share toys, food or his people. In the last few months Rex has developed some anxiety when left alone and his previous owner said he should be crated during these times. He is really looking for a committed family that will give him time to adjust and willing to work through any issues that may arise.",

I've weighed in to be just over thirty pounds, but I do still have some growing to do. I am full of life and energy and love to play with toys! Not much is known of my past, but I did travel to Arizona all the way from Barb's Rescue in Mexico. My favorite thing to do now is go for walks and spend time with my people as well as the other dogs I've made friends with while staying in HALO's care. I look forward to learning and training with my new handler, especially knowing treats can be involved. I love getting treats as a reward. I am still working on mastering my manners and learning not to jump up when greeting you, but sometimes I just get so excited and try to give hugs. I am such a sweet girl and I'm ready for my forever home. If you have the time and space for a young pup like me, please call my friends at HALO to schedule to meet me in person. I hope to meet you soon!",

She will make an excellent active time partner and cuddle buddy. Marcie is going to blossom in a loving home with adults and children 10+.\n\nxxx\n\nPlease note: \nWe are currently adopting out of state for our longer stay animals only.

            "description": "Sasha is a gorgeous Great Pyrenees with maybe some Australian Shepherd mixed in. Even more beautiful in person! She just turned 1 this month and is ready for her forever home.  She was adopted by a young couple who live in an apartment which is no life for a Great Pyr so they surrendered her.  We are thrilled to now have her in the Colorado mountains where we know she will be such a happy girl.  Very friendly with people, gets along great with other dogs.  We are told no cats. \n\nHer foster mom says about her \"What a fun dog. Sasha is a BIG beautiful dog, with big happy energy.  She is confident from the get go, warms up to everyone immediately!!   A large yard is a must for her, she runs around, rolls and plays in the snow.  Playing is her game and she often strikes play pose.  Because of her SIZE you have to watch out so she doesn't run into you.  Someone who can play with her or has another dog to play with would be best.  She  is more than interested when you are in the kitchen preparing dinner.  Her head is counter level so she can definitely see what's cooking. I let her have the run of the house, she sleeps in my room, after getting up on my bed to kiss me goodnight, gets back down and is happy sleeping on the floor next to my bed. Because of her happy go lucky attitude I feel she would adjust to her forever home whenever the right one is found---of course no hurry.\u201d  \n\nSasha is already spayed, microchipped, current on her vaccinations and on heartworm preventative (negative for HW) and ready to romp!\n\nIf you would like to meet this beauty, please first research Great Pyrenees as they are not for everyone!

            "description": "Lady Whistledown is the sweetest 7-8 year old Rottweiler mix, who weighs about 55 pounds (but could shed a few of her extra pounds off).\n\nAfter being abandoned and living in a junkyard for several months, she is resilient. The best word that her rescuer/foster used to describe her is that she\u2019s an angel. Every person who has interacted with her, even if it\u2019s in passing, says how sweet she is and can\u2019t believe where she came from. All Lady wants to do is please and be loved. \n\nLady is house trained and is full of love. She is heartworm positive, but is currently undergoing the first stage of treatment and is so excited to get rid of them once and for all. Lady would do best in a home either alone or with a low energy / older dog. We are unsure about cats and we do know that she would do okay if left alone for short periods of time without having to be crated. \n\nLady would be best in a family who will be patient with her slow walking and who has an abundance of extra love to give this deserving girl. Apply to take this baby girl home only if you plan to give her the best life that she definitely deserves.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

Petey is a male Lhasa Apso mix that is 8 years young and weighs 17 pounds. This gentleman came to us as an owner surrender when his owner went to hospice. Petey's heart was broken and he was very confused when he came to the shelter. He lived with one owner his whole life. We have Petey listed as a special needs pup because of his chronic allergies and his need for help with housetraining. Petey suffers from chronic skin allergies and ear infections. Petey's skin was a mess from untreated skin allergies and ear infections when he came into our care. He is scheduled for a dental cleaning and ear treatment mid-February. His ears were swollen shut with infection. He has been in a foster home where he has gradually become happier. There is more pep to his steps. He will need to have her ears cleaned daily with an inexpensive ear cleaner. He will need weekly baths with medicated shampoo. He is being placed on prescription dog food for his allergies and will also need to be on some type of skin medication for the rest of his life, such as apoquel. While in foster care, we have also learned that Petey will need a lot of patience and help with housetraining. We believe with patience and a good routine, Petey will have fewer accidents in the home. Petey is looking for a calm household. Older children are preferred. Petey is low-medium energy level. He spends a lot of his time sleeping and sitting by his person. He is very loyal. Petey is cat and dog friendly. He can go up and down stairs with no problem and he enjoys his daily walks. He loves car rides and prefers to sit on your lap. A meet and greet with any resident canines is required. Petey will be happy with a nice comfy bed, patience and love. Petey is microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm negative and neutered. Petey's adoption fee is $85. If you are looking for a loyal companion, please e-mail: dogadoptions@parmashelter.org and arrange a meet with our gentle Petey.Like Parma Animal Shelter on FACEBOOK and help pass the word about our adoptable guests!

Ringo is extremely intelligent, handsome, a great family dog, and very athletic.  Ringo has been through obedience training classes, and is trust-worthy in a home. \n\nRingo just turned 8 years old, is in good physical health, and neutered.  While he can walk and possibly interact with larger dogs if properly introduced, Ringo can not live in a home with other animals.  He does have a high prey drive,\n\nAlthough not required, Ringo would benefit from a home with a fenced in yard.   He is perfect for an active owner.   Currently, Ringo is part of our owner referral program.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\nSedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes. All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots\n\nOur adoption area includes New Jersey, Delaware Valley, Manhattan, Southern New York.

Need a reminder to take snack breaks... this guy will not disappoint. He is the best snuggle buddy and will keep you warm on those cold winter days. \n\nFerdinand is a chill dude who does well with children 8 years and older. He is still learning his leash manners and would like a home where he can continue to build his skills. Ferdinand has some ricosuave moves and comes in a little too hot when meeting other dogs. Ferdinand would love to be the only pet in his new home with an experienced adopter that would take it slow.\n\nFerdinand is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted many happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month.\n\nFerdinand is 82 pounds, 3-5 years old, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped.

I am a 7-month-old black and white terrier/chihuahua mix and I am currently working on my housebreaking skills. I am super friendly, I love everybody, especially other dogs. I am the doggy \u201cgoodwill ambassador\u201d of my foster home because every day I like to welcome and say hi to every one of my foster brothers and sisters.. It is so cute! I love to play with toys and I love to snuggle with my humans. I can be high energy (I'm just barely out of puppyhood) and I can be calm when you cuddle me in your arms.\n\nBirthdate: 6/19/2020\nWeight: 6 lbs.\n",

Need a reminder to take snack breaks... this guy will not disappoint. He is the best snuggle buddy and will keep you warm on those cold winter days. \n\nFerdinand is a chill dude who does well with children 8 years and older. He is still learning his leash manners and would like a home where he can continue to build his skills. Ferdinand has some ricosuave moves and comes in a little too hot when meeting other dogs. Ferdinand would love to be the only pet in his new home with an experienced adopter that would take it slow.\n\nFerdinand is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted many happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month.\n\nFerdinand is 82 pounds, 3-5 years old, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped. Please fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or send an email to goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com if you are interested in Ferdinand.",

They are great with dogs of all sizes but we recommend older kids as they get so excited and jump and can knock a small child over. They love to curl up with you, go for a walk or play with you in the yard and enjoy nylabones. These babies are UTD on vaccines, spayed, neutered and current on heartworm and flea/tick prevention. Adopt one or both! 350$ each adoption fee. If you are interested in meeting one of these babies fill out the application on my page!",

Well, again, Dandy is your boy!\n\nDandy is between 9 and 12 months old and we believe he is a lab/shepherd mix. Dandy can be a little nervous at time but if you have a treat, he will be your best friend. Dandy is smart and picking up on everything new! He has quickly learned to sit, down, and crawl. He is almost 100% on Loose leash walking not jumping and being comfortable in a crate. We dont know much about his past but considering new things scare him he will do best with someone that wants to show him the works is a good place and not scary.\n\nDandy is currently in a foster home with several dogs and one of his favorite activities is to sprint around the yard with them. He is going to do best in a home with another dog to keep him busy! Dandy also lives with cats, small animals, and 3 older children and does well with them - it is recommended he be in a home with older children due to his size. Are you looking for a dog that is a great mix of active, smart, and snuggly? Then you should really apply to adopt then Dandy at pipsrescue.org/adopt",

            "description": "True to her name, Honey is a sweet older gal who LOVES her people and is very attentive to them. If you're looking for a mellow yet engaged partner in crime to watch TV with, read to, or to supervise you in the kitchen, Honey is the one! She may be a bit of a diva about her paws touching the snow, but throw some booties on her and she is still eager to run around in the yard and sniff endlessly, or to go on a nice medium-length hike. In classic pittie fashion, Honey can dish out the sass when she \"talks\" or when she playfully tugs on the leash with her mouth, but at the end of the day she is the most loyal couch potato you could ever possibly dream of. She also already knows several basic commands and is fully house trained. It is important to note that Honey is not a fan of other animals and must be the only pet in the home, but trust us, she's worth it!",

I came to the UP from Missouri, where I had been found as a dumped off dog at a construction site. When the team moved on, they couldn't leave me behind, so a regular visitor and volunteer (yep - all the way from the UP) brought me to CCHS! Now that I've gotten accustomed to this new place and got all my vet work done, I'm ready to find my new home! \n\nI'm okay on a leash, but still learning. The staff doesn't know if I'm potty trained, but I don't make messes in my kennel. Some other dogs are okay, but I prefer females that are lower key and not too hyper around me. No cats, please. I would do best in a calmer, adult only home with people who understand that it may take me a little while to trust. But, if you promise me lots of belly rubs, I'll be your best friend soon enough.\n\n**My day-to-day care is sponsored by Jackie Huntoon**",

They can be a great family dog but will require an extensive amount of DAILY exercise, consistent and ongoing training, and just like any other herding breed will likely nip as a way of \"controlling,\" situations. Herding dogs also will need ongoing socialization with not only dogs, but with people, in and out of the home in order to be more accepting of others versus defensive of property. Please keep that in mind PRIOR to informing us that you want to meet this litter. Your research on any breed is highly important both in the quality of life of this animal but cohesion and happiness of your family. This breed does not fit the parameters of every lifestyle and we want to ensure this breed will fit yours.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

She shared her home with children from 5 years to 17 years old.  Basil does not do well with cats or other dogs.  \n\nBasil was kept indoors and enjoyed short walks with her family each day.  She has been known to 'door dash' and escape from her yard on occasion.   Basil is housebroken.\n\nThough Basil has not attended formal obedience training classes, she has been taught several commands by her previous owners (sit, speak, shake, roll over, mine, jump, and easy).  \n\nThis girl epitomizes the oft-used phrase 'gentle giant'.  Basil weighs 81 lbs and walks gently on a leash.\n\nBasil has already been spayed.\n",

Need a reminder to take snack breaks... this guy will not disappoint. He is the best snuggle buddy and will keep you warm on those cold winter days. \n\nFerdinand is a chill dude who does well with children 8 years and older. He is still learning his leash manners and would like a home where he can continue to build his skills. Ferdinand has some ricosuave moves and comes in a little too hot when meeting other dogs. Ferdinand would love to be the only pet in his new home with an experienced adopter that would take it slow.\n\nFerdinand is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted many happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month.\n\nFerdinand is 82 pounds, 3-5 years old, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped. Please fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or send an email to goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com if you are interested in Ferdinand.",

Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. You may call 559-393-1946 between 6PM and 9PM if you have additional questions AFTER SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment.",

So, if you want a great project for an athletic dog, or you need a good running buddy, Rooster might be the guy for you! Rooster must go to a family who has lots of heeler experience and dog training experience as he is a big boy who really needs to know the rules! He's a joy to be around though. Someone who runs marathons and wants a training buddy would be great!!",

            "description": "Sweet Frank is a young, 1.5-yr old Pitt Bull Terrier who recently found himself euth listed in an overcrowded shelter in Texas. With the help of a partnering organization, Muddy Paws was able to bring Frank and 12 other young dogs 900 miles to rescue. Tonight Frankie is safe, warm, and adjusting to his new beginning. He'll be spending the next few days acclimating to his new environment (and climate!) and we'll be posting more information about his personality and furever \"wish list\" in the coming days! Welcome to rescue, Frank!\n\nBefore applying to adopt Frankie, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Frankie is $400 We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "At just a year old, this handsome Doberman Pinscher mix named Finn found himself on the euthenasia list in an overcrowded shelter in Texas. With the help of a partnering organization, Muddy Paws was able to bring Finn and 12 other young dogs 900 miles to rescue. Finn is now safe and warm in his foster home but is excited to start the search for his \"furever\" family. He has the heart of a puppy and loves to play with other dogs and people. Finn even gets along with the cat in his foster home, sometimes he will chase him because he'd like to play. Finn is a big fan of toys and antlers. He is fully potty trained and does not cry in his kennel. When left to free roam in the house he doesn't cause any trouble. After puppy playtime is over, Finn loves to curl up next to his people on the couch. His foster mom describes him as \"one of the most well-rounded dogs she has ever met\"! His new home will need a fenced yard, an experienced dog owner, and a playful family full of love and patience. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Finn is $400 We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Diamond is shy and skittish at first, but is continuing to open up as she gains trust with her foster family. She LOVES finally having the comforts of a home!! Her favorite activities are taking naps on the couch, going for short walks, following a doggie companion around, and getting pets/attention once she feels comfortable. Diamond requires a secure, fenced in yard and another calm medium-to-large dog, as well as a patient adopter who will give her time to come out of her shell. Absolutely NO small dogs, cats, or other small animals in the home. Diamond is house trained, crate trained, and walks well on a leash! She is currently being treated for Lyme. Help give this sweet girl a chance to finally shine!!",

I am at a healthy weight now, after spending some time in a foster home. I had been dumped and left to starve a couple of months ago. A good samaritan took me in and made my life so much better! I'm now a healthy girl, I've been spayed and vaccinated, and I'm all ready to go to my forever home! \n\nIf you're interested in me, please don't call these nice people (they're very busy!). Instead, apply for me here: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/1369/generic . There is a spot on the application where you can ask any questions you might have about me or the adoption process.

Im a sweet Chow mix (with an adorable snaggletooth). Im about 9-years old, 40-pounds, and in good health! My vision and hearing arent top of the line, but I get along just fine. Im not neutered yet, but its on my calendar. After spending many lonely weeks at the Bakersfield Humane Society, I was transferred to The Animal Pads care where Ive been loving my time with my foster. Im so thankful for my second chance at life. Now all I need is a special hooman who will love me furever! You may notice my beautiful lion cut, and I got my hair done to help with the matted fur and rash, remnants of shelter life. My skin is much better and I will be a furry legend as soon as hair grows back! Or we could continue with this, rawwwrrrrr!\n\nIm a friendly pooch who adores other doggos. I love playing with my furry foster siblings and keeping them company! I havent met any cats yet, but since Im such a mellow man, I think wed be just fine. My hobbies include following my people around the house, long walks, naps, scratches behind the ears, and just being with you! I love going out in public, hitting the beach, and meeting new people. Its not a ruff life!\n\nIm quickly learning all of the good boy behaviors. I had a few slip-ups in the beginning, but with regular trips outside, I dont have accidents in the house. I do well on the leash and I dont get anxious when left alone. I can get a bit defensive when Im startled or when the vet gets a little too handsy. I might give a little snarl, but with some training, I think Ill get more comfortable & trusting. (Some treats wouldnt hurt either!)\n\nMy ideal furever family is one who will give me the love and care Ive always longed for. I think Id do just fine in a mellow or medium energy home. Since I can get startled, I think Id do best with older kids. I would adore having some furry siblings to keep me company, but thats not a deal-breaker. As long as I get lots of love from you, Ill be a happy hound! If youre looking for a sweet companion to be your best bud, adopt Barney! My adoption fee is $200 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here: https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. You may call 559-393-1946 between 6PM and 9PM if you have additional questions AFTER SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment.",

Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. You may call 559-393-1946 between 6PM and 9PM if you have additional questions AFTER SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment.",

            "description": "Sammy Dean is an approximate 4 year old, 58 pound big baby who thinks he weighs about 10 pounds.    He loves to be loved on and cuddled.  He's laid back and a bit lazy.   He's great with kids and good with other pups, but has to be the dominant male.   Like many rescue pups, he's still a bit protective over his food, but separate feeding stations work.   He enjoys spending time sleeping, cuddling, and sleeping.    He needs a stable home with folks who are willing to pay attention to him and give him the love he deserves.   He's great with kids and is ready to find his very own furever family!   Please open your home & hearts for this special boy!\n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by his veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nFYI:   Even though this pup tested heartworm negative, we provide the following procedural information for your information:  Any of our pups who test HW+ are treated with the *slow kill method of treatment.   The *slow-kill method, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.

While she loves to play and fetch, she'll need a human that can pace her. Nellie's heart and mind aren't in sync with her 10 year old body and she can get sore if she overdoes it. She will also need a home without stairs to stay comfortable. She has done well with cats and other animals. She is housetrained, but will need someone to take her out often. She would probably do well with a doggie door or a family that is home most of the day. Nellie walks well on a leash and knows basic commands, such as sit. She does well around elementary school aged children and older, but has not been introduced to babies or toddlers yet. She is always up for an adventure - she was very curious and playful during a day trip to play in the snow. Nellie is a wonderful companion and is ready to find her forever family!",

            "description": "Howdy! Im Pluto.\nOh boy do I have a story for you. Im 10 years old as you can see, and I was recently rescued by the Great Plains SPCA HERO team. My whole life, Ive lived outside on a chain, aside from a few times when the weather was really bad and my previous owner let me come inside. Because of my past living situation, Im a little unsure about this whole new life at the shelter. I was pretty nervous at first, but the staff here were so kind. They gave me time and space to get used to being around humans and being indoors, and I started opening up. When I do get comfortable with you, Ill ever-so-gently paw at you to ask for attention and pets. The humans say its real precious.\nNow, I can be uneasy with new people, as you might imagine. The staff here will show you how to go slow with me and give me space to get comfortable. Patience is key. I do know a few commands sit, come and shake to be exact. I am treat motivated and listen to direction well, when its from someone I trust. Im not too sure what those toy things are all about quite yet, but I think Id be happy to learn!\nWhile new people make me nervous at first, dogs are a whole other story! My goofy side comes out when other canines are around. Ive been around small and big dogs at the shelter. Im still learning how to interact appropriately with other dogs, but I definitely show potential. I do think having another dog around would help me grow.\nIm just an old boy looking for a new lease on life. Well have some work to do in terms of building my confidence, but itll be worth it in the end! I hope you see that I have potential, just come from a non-traditional past. I hope youll take a chance on a fellow like me.\nLove,\nPluto\nRequirements:\nTo ensure that Pluto and the children in your life are both safe and comfortable, Pluto is eligible to go home with children 12 and older. Pluto must meet all family members prior to being adopted.\nMedical Information:\nPluto has tested positive for heartworms. Great Plains SPCA covers the cost of confirmatory heartworm testing and general blood work, 30 days of antibiotics prior to heartworm treatment, and the heartworm treatment injections that will kill the adult worms. We ask that as Pluto's new owner, you purchase 6 months of heartworm prevention at time of adoption to partner with us during Pluto's treatment. Heartworm prevention should be given monthly to any dog, but it is especially important for Pluto as it is crucial to ensure they never become infected with heartworms again.\n ...",

Scooby (we call him Scoobs) adores people, especially the kind that will bend down and rub his belly or play fetch with him.  Scoobs is a high-energy, slightly kooky (in the best way) boy who will do well with lots of playtime and walks.  He has a ton of personality and is madly in love with people, all people.  He would thrive in a more active home, where he can go with you on your walks and runs.  Scoobs seems good with other dogs and has not been cat-tested, although we think he may be a little too exuberant for our feline friends.  \n",

I am very active, inquisitive and love learning about the world around me. I am very smart and quickly learned to come to my name and go potty on pee pads because I'm too little to go outside yet.\nI get cold very easily, so I insist on lots of cuddling!\n\nI just love to eat, play hard, snuggle, sleep, then repeat!\nI like my kennel and sleep all night long in my crate, cozy with my sister.\n\nIt was great being with my ten siblings but now I live with just one sister and an older foster sister. I get along well with other dogs and all people too. As I am still very young, I require a lot of attention and guidance. I am looking for a forever family who will be patient with me and help me to grow healthy, get lots of exercise and engage my smart mind! If that\n's you, please apply to adopt me today!\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, rabies vaccination, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Distemper combo vaccines appropriate to age, Bordetella vaccine, heartworm and flea/tick preventative while in rescue.

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 9/22/2020\nReason for being in rescue: owner surrender\nFoster location: Foster Home in Rocky Mount, NC\nSpecial Needs? Florence is a beautiful dog with an edge. She absolutely requires an experienced rescuer committed to positive reinforcement training. She will not be adopted to a home with children.\nWeight: 14 lbs, Florence is overweight and needs to lose at least 2 pounds.\nHeight: 14 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $299\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Florence requires a home with a very experienced owner. If you have never had your own dog, or have never rescued a dog with behavioral challenges, please do not apply. Florence is not your girl. Florence is in a foster living happily with other dogs and cats. She absolutely cannot be around children. Florence has a lot of love to share with the experienced alpha that will set boundaries, reinforce them positively, and show her lots of positive affirmation.\n\nWhat is my personality like? The stories Florence could tell! Florence was hit by a car as a young dog. Her owners couldn't afford medical care so they surrendered her to an animal shelter in Georgia. The leg was wrapped and \"set\" and Florence was adopted out. Thankfully, Florence was adopted by a very experienced owner who recognized that the leg needed attention or Florence would lose it. Off they went to a specialty hospital where Florence had surgery to repair her leg. She slowly healed and recovered. Today you would never know there was anything wrong.\n\nAfter having her leg repaired, Florence developed a luxating patella in one of her rear legs. Back to the surgeon she went for another surgery and another success. Then in 2018 a CT Scan determined that Florence had a collapsing trachea. She was placed on opiod medicines, but they made no difference. So today Florence has a cough and her physical activity is limited.\n\nIn late 2018, Florence's owners started her on Bravecto under veterinary guidance. They only gave her 2 doses, but Florence's behavior changed completely. Whether the behavior shift was due to the preventative is unknown. Regardless, Florence went from being a very sweet and affectionate lap dog to a dog that can have aggressive behaviors.\n\nFlorence is as sweet a dog as you will meet 75% of the time. She loves to snuggle, greets you with kisses, and will play with toys happily. But Florence has a switch. You can watch her eyes gloss over and her demeanor change entirely. And when it changes, Florence will snap at you.\n\nFlorence needs boundaries. She is not a dog that can sleep in your bed or sit on the couch with you. Yes, she would love to. She would love nothing more. But when you allow her these luxuries, she takes advantage of them and behaves poorly. When Florence has boundaries, her behavior is manageable. She has a very loving heart.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Florence's birthday is 10/16/2012\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nSumo is a big playful goofball wiggle butt.  He is easy going and friendly.  He loves attention and affection.  Now all he needs is a family he can call his own.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire.\n\nDue to COVID-19 precautions, all animals for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nMagic is a shy, sweet girl. In her foster home, Magic has been learning how to be a dog and relax indoors for the first time. She has discovered a love for toys and blankets; she absolutely loves to play with them! She is little miss confident outside where she trots around, rolls in the grass, and barks at all the people and cars going by. She is a treat connoisseur and is determined to try all of them! Bonus: she is housetrained.\n\nMagic has made so much progress, but she is still working on getting completely comfortable around people. She will now happily lay near her foster parents on the couch or bed but still doesn't enjoy being touched by them. She gently takes food from their hands (food really is the way to her heart). She gets extra shy when new people come by, so she keeps her distance from them.\n\nMagic loves having another dog around to show her the ropes. However, she prefers a dog friend that doesn't jump on her and constantly get in her face. A home with small children may not be the best for this same reason. She has also been fine with the resident cat. She needs a fenced yard because she has not mastered leash walking yet, but everyone loves watching her run around and play in the yard!\n\nShe is a sweetheart who needs a patient home that will continue to show her that the world isn't scary and she can trust humans. It is clear that she wants human attention and love, but she's still learning how to comfortably receive it.\nAdoption Coordinator: Lauren T.\nLocation: Foster\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog/puppy is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Dexter! I am new to the shelter! I was surrendered because my mom was not able to care for me any longer. She really loved me though. I went on lots of car rides and even had baths at a professional groomer. She told the staff that I love other dogs but the staff have not had a chance to see for themselves how I behave yet. The staff at the shelter notice that I seem to get over excited very easily. I may not be a great choice for a first time dog owner. I would do best in a home with experienced adults only. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $135.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included",

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Max and I am a very active dog, I am a puppy after all. I need LOTS of training. I try to door dash and can sometimes be hard to leash. I also tend to pull a lot on the leash when I walk, the good thing is that I am easy to redirect. I mean what can you expect, I just want to take the whole world in at once. I tolerate the humans touching me all over, so giving me checkups should be easy. I do like to play with humans and will play bow and demand attention by pawing at you when given the chance. When it comes to toys, I do not know what to do with them. I know the squeaky toys and balls grab by attention but aside from that, what is their purpose? Treats! I love my rawhide! Sooo good. Speaking about treats, I am extremely food motivated. I do not know what sit means but I automatically do it because I know it gets me stuff. I will be easy to train if you use those yummy treats. Now... it cannot be all perfect, right? I am not the best when it comes to dogs. I tend to initially bark and lunge at them. It takes me a long time to get used to the other dog and just accept their presence. Once I am familiar with the dog, I will settle down and go back to taking the world in. Staff: Dog tries to door dash, jumps a lot and is hard to leash. Pulls on leash. Is very easily distracted. Toys get his attention but does not know how to play with them. Loves rawhide, allowed for trade off. Was eating food but did not like the hand and stepped back and ignored the food for the rest of the time. Play bows, demands attention by pawing at you. Will automatically sit, does not know commands, will be trainable. Allows you to touch him just fine. Dog-to-Dog: Walked past GSD in the yard on our way to the BA room. Will bark and lunge. Used calm female for test. He initially barked and lunged at her when walking opposite way. Interaction lasted 20-30 mina and the more he saw her, the more he calmed down. Were able to sniff each other, no attempt to bite. He rolled on his back and let female sniff him. Very excited but will calm down to the point where they can be face to face and he will be distracted by something else. Dog-to-Cat: Walked cattery rooms, paid no attention to the cats. When he went inside the room kept sniffing and trying to play w/ the bedding. Once he did see a cat he started whining and play-bowing. Wanted to engage, after the cats hissed and retreated, he kept insisting on playing but was able to direct away nicely.",

            "description": "Clarice was found living in a tent community in the south where she was loved and had lots of socialization with people and other animals. She had her own siblings as playmates and did great with them.\n\nClarice recently had her own puppies and has been a great mom! Puppies are pretty much spoken for so now it's her turn. \n\nClarice's foster says she would be a great dog for a family - she is very sweet and loves to cuddle. She has done great with her foster canine siblings. And she's even co-existing with a cat in home home. \n\nThere are no children in her foster home but we know she was exposed to them in her prior living situation and her foster feels given her sweet nature she would do jus well with kids.\n\nClarice has not been exposed to a crate and spends time in a separate area of the house while left home without any issues. She has also been housetrained in her foster home. She does well on a leash and does not react to other dogs while walking.\n\nThis beautiful mama mama is truly the whole package, affectionate, a great playmate, not a big barker, bonds well with her person. What more could you ask for?\n\nClarice is heartworm positive and she has started her treatment - don't let that keep you from considering her - we cover the costs and try to have you work with one of our partner vets that hopefully is close to you!!\n\nName: Clarice\nBreed: Terrier/Labrador Retriever\nSex: Female\nAge: 1 1/2 yrs (estimate)\nWeight: 62 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Positive, has started pre-treatment.\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Yes, saying older children for now. \nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

He was not properly socialized with humans as a puppy, so he is incredibly fearful and is an extreme flight risk. He gets along well with other dogs, but until he feels safe in his home, he will likely not accept love and attention from his humans.\n\nAs he is fearful and an extreme flight risk, he will need an experienced adopter who can provide him with the patience, time and structure needed for him to be comfortable in his new home. He is currently working with his foster mom on leash training, as he is afraid of the leash and shuts down when on leash.\n\nHe will do best in a home with another dog, so we will only be processing applications from potential adopters who have another, confident dog in the home. As two of the other dogs surrendered with him have escaped on their first day in their new homes, and he is fearful on leash, we would prefer a secure fenced yard for this boy's forever home.\n\nFocaccia's adoption fee will be $385\nPlease note: We only accept adoption applications through our website or in person (Facebook and Petfinder inquiries are not considered applications).",

I am really playful and energetic at times when I see fun new friends to play with. But then when I've calmed down all I want to do is take a nice warm relaxing nap with my human. And I love belly rubs and will do anything for your attention. Well, I Hope to see you soon! \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $525\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

She was put out of the house by her owner and was living alone in her backyard in the cold and heat for over a year. Very excited to be loved and indoors, she is a very loyal pet. She does not like strangers so we are trying to socialize her. Usually a simple treat is all it takes. She can be dominant when it comes to food and treats but she is learning and can be corrected. She is trained to not go in the house and uses a pet door. The pink on her nose is a healing injury. When we got her it was all scabbed over. Her adoption fee is $275. She comes spayed, UTD and microchipped. please apply at\nwww.misfitsdogrescue.org",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nJosie is a bit shy and would benefit from basic manners training to help her gain confidence and deal with people and other dogs in social situations.  She is affectionate and loves attention.  She takes treats gently.  She is waiting to meet you.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "2 yrsMeet Butterscotch! This cutie-pie Labrador Retriever mix is approximately 2 years old and weighs about 54 pounds. He loves to cuddle- but not JUST cuddle, he will nuzzle his head into his foster's neck and groan from the pure joy of feeling safe and close to a human. How is that for dog therapy?! Butterscotch is always happy. He will play with the other dog in his foster home and is dog-friendly, but people are his favorite! He lets his foster parents do whatever they want; he's okay with his paws being touched, tail being touched, messing with his face, squeezing, picking up -everything! Butterscotch is current on his vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered. Contact\ninfo@rockwallpets.com\nfor more info or to arrange a meeting with this sweet boy!",

She is approximately 4 years old, weighs about 45 pounds (could use to gain a little) and is a sweet girl. Betty is new to Mutts and we will update her bio as we get to know her.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

This older guy has a very friendly disposition and a lovable personality.  He adored HSOV kennel tech Brad who helped him with his photo session and kept looking to him for reassurance.\n\nThe information we were given about Bane indicates that he is good with children and also with cats.  He appears to be ok with other dogs.  Bane is housebroken. \n\nBane is cautious around people that he doesn't know, so it takes him a little while to warm up to new friends.\n\nBane is being listed as a 'Special Needs Dog' since he has a yeast infection on his skin (which is being treated), and he also has some missing hair.  But he is still a beautiful boy in our eyes :)\n\nBane weighs 58.6 lbs and walks fairly well on a leash.  He will be neutered before being adopted by his new family.\n",

Thank you!** \n\nThis gracious lady is Nikki, a 9-year old, 61-pound, Bulldog/Hound mix senior.\n\nNikki is a sweet, gentle, very laid back, youngish senior. She had a single home with a family since she was a puppy, but their circumstances have changed and they must find a new home for her. \n\nShe has adjusted well to her foster home, becoming a big family favorite. Nikki loves attention, waddles when she walks, prefers to snuggle and take long naps. \n\nShe will be your best friend and follow you everywhere. Nikki has great manners, doesn\u2019t chew on anything and has a huge heart.\n\nNikki gets along great with other dogs and simply adores everyone she meets. Might as well get some of that love at your house.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  \n\nTo adopt or learn more about Nikki, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $425]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nHoney can be a bit timid at first but she warms up quickly and loves attention and affection.  She would benefit greatly from socialization and she would become more confident in social situations with people and other dogs.  This girl just needs a chance to show you what a great addition to your family she would be.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",
