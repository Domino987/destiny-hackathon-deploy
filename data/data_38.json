Everyone at Mutts is excited for Daisy May to find her forever home.\n\nThanks to our amazing foster family and support system, Daisy is excelling and her socialization skills are coming along nicely. Just look at those eyes-you can tell she'll be eager to please her new family.\n\nDaisy is inquisitive and loves to learn so a family that is excited to take her training to the next level would be ideal for her so she can really blossom into the dog she is meant to be.\n\n\nQuick Stats:\nNap vs. Playing: Loves naps a bit more than playing right now.\nFood vs. Toys: Food is her favorite, she's very food motivated and is eager to learn new things.\nDogs vs. Humans: Interactions have gone ok with the other dogs in the home but she loves her humans LOTS!\n\nQuick Report Card on the Basics:\nThey have been fostered with other dogs and have done well with their respectful canine friends. \nThey have been fostered with cats but for now we don't recommend having a feline in her adoptive home. \nThey are not being fostered with children but would likely do well with kids that know how to interact with dogs.\n\nIf Daisy May sounds like the dog you've been waiting for, please fill out our adoption application today!",

I weigh about 63 pounds and I think I'm pretty close to being 11 years old. I was rescued from the SPCA in 2012 so that's why I'm unsure of my age. I still have a lot of spunk in me for an old fellow. My best friend is a 5 year old, 33 pound Australian Shepherd. We play and wrestle every single day. I prefer to be around dogs that are smaller than me and I think it's a lot of fun to chase after cats, so it may be best to keep me away from them. I currently have a tiny two year old human at home whom I adore. I am very gentle with him and show him lots of love. I know I would make any family very happy, whether they have children or not. I get excited when I get to go on car rides but I'm also perfectly content being a couch potato at home with my family. I like to think that I'm well behaved. I can tell you when I have to go outside, and I also know cool tricks like sit, stay, lie down and shake. Thunderstorms and loud noises can sometimes scare me, so I like to be around my human friends during those times. All in all, I'm a lovable guy who would love the opportunity to put a smile on your face and to be apart of the family.\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

I was rescued from a hoarding situation so I am very slowly learning how to be a regular dog.\n\nI am great with other dogs, especially small ones. They are perfect snuggle size for me! I get very stressed by children and need a home without them.\n\nI am not potty trained and I am very scared of the great big outdoors. I sometimes use a pee pad but not every time. \n\nI am not a lap dog and do not enjoy being handled. I will come to you for pets when I want them but I am quite independent and am not a cuddler.\n\nI am looking for a quiet home, preferably with other small dogs with someone who understands my need for space and accepts me as the adorable little mess that I am!\n\nYou can apply to adopt me here: https://www.dogsdeservebetterblueridge.org/adopt\n",

            "description": "Jacks is a six-year old larger Dachshund mix boy whose owner could no longer take care of him. He is around 25 lbs - a chunky boy. No young children! No male dogs either - ok with female dogs. We were told Jacks is housetrained, leash trained, & crate trained. He stayed in a fence and prefers indoors. He knows a few commands and lived with a bird. Now he is has been slightly testy with us at times so think it takes him a bit to warm up and feel comfortable and we are thinking his vision might also not be the best. That means he needs someone to go slow with him and let him feel confident in his new environment - not coming in putting your face in his and pushing him too fast. Jacks likes to play fetch.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "**PLEASE READ MAX'S BIO THOROUGHLY BEFORE INQUIRING. ALL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED. **\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Max, our handsome little guy who needs a VERY specific home. Max is a 14 month old male Maltese/Terrier/ Poodle mix who is approximately 17lbs of pure cuteness! This little guy came to us as an owner surrender when they felt they no longer had the time to care for a puppy. Unfortunately Max did not have much socialization and it shows because he is a very nervous pup. He took almost 2 months in his foster home before we began to see any signs of trust. He still will not let us attempt to pick him up and it takes careful maneuvering to do so. He is also NOT GOOD AT ALL on leash and will definitely need work on this issue. He is a fast and very agile pup and will require a very active home that can eventually run and hike with him. He CANNOT be in a sedentary home. Max is a puppy still and we only place our young dogs and puppies in homes with another young dog. He cannot go into a home if the only other dog is an adult or senior. This boy is ENERGETIC, FAST, and VERY ROUGH. When Max gets comfortable with his dog friends and starts to play, well, he plays very rough and tough. He likes to play bite on the tail, legs, and ears and drag the other dog around. He likes to pounce on them out of nowhere. He likes to chase them. If your dog does not play like this or you don't think they would be comfortable with playing like this, then Max would not be a candidate. Due to his jittery and jumpy anxiety, he cannot go into a home with young children 12 years or younger. One thing to know is Max is still in the puppy chewing faze. He is slowly growing out of it, but we see that he still will pick up things in his mouth and chew on them. He has recently chewed on the corner of some outdoor furniture, so his new home MUST be puppy savvy and ok with \"accidents\" like this and not get upset. We DO NOT want him crated because his last owner kept him in a crate most of the day and it was very detrimental to him. Another main requirement for Max is that he MUST go into a home with a yard. He cannot be an apartment/condo type dog. This guys loves to run here there and everywhere! Max is not an easy dog to feed and it definitely has to do with issues in his last home and the lack of socialization. If you set a plate of food down, he will just stare at it and not eat. He needs a lot of coaxing and someone who is willing to work with that issue by hand feeding him so he can gain trust. We want him in a home that will continue to feed him the way we do and what we feed him. He needs a good high quality dry food along with adding some high quality wet food and some home cooking. Max is on the thinner side and needs a little bulking up. We see that his fur was sparse/thin in areas and we want someone to continue adding supplements to get his coat in good condition. Max is very agile and can jump easily and because he is fast we require a 3ft gate at the front door in the inside of the home. This is contractual and will prevent him from taking off each time the door is open /closed. This is required regardless if you have a secure screen door or a gated front yard. This little guy did not have the best life as a young puppy and that is why we are being so specific in his forever home....he deserves it and more. \n\n\n--Because of Max's insecurities, we are requiring at least 2-3 meet/greets before even deciding to go the next step. Max is in the Torrance area and if chosen to do a meet/greet, you must come down 2-3 separate occasions with everyone in the household, including your dog to get to know him.\n\nMax's adoption fee is $550\n\n\nWE ONLY ADOPT IN LOS ANGELES AND SURROUNDING AREAS AS AN INPERSON HOME CHECK AND TRIAL PERIOD ARE REQUIRED.\n\n\nIf you meet all the requirements and would like an application, please contact us at 310-990-2020 or at Gina@theforgottendog.org",

Inside, she is a great big spoon or little spoon as the weather gets colder, and loves nothing more than snuggling up to her humans in any way she can. Her foster parents say she\u2019s a couch potato 80% of the time!\n\nMaddie is about 3 years old and 45 pounds. She has been doing fantastic in her foster home with learning tricks, commands and socializing with humans and other dogs with slow proper introductions. She is EXCELLENT on her recall skills and always comes running back when called. On a leash, Maddie gets hyper focused and pulls to play with other dogs/chase squirrels, so a calmer more suburban environment would be more ideal for her. She would do best in a home with experienced large breed handlers and no other animals. Maddie has been absolutely wooing her foster family with snuggles and her charm, and everyone who\u2019s met her has fallen in love with her.\u00a0Maddie is up to date on vaccies, crate and potty trained.\n\nCheck out the previous video:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/p/CHtCJuejn34/\u00a0to see all the tricks that Maddie has learned! Maddie's ideal home would be with someone with previous large breed dog expreiece and no other dogs.\n\nThis precious girl cannot wait to find a forever family of her own who will continue to provide her with structure and training. Could it be you?\u00a0\n\n\nApply to adopt at rescuecity.nyc/adopt!\u00a0\n\n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ.\u00a0\n\n(We will consider other nearby states for adoption on a case by case basis. You must be willing to travel Brooklyn, NY to finalize the adoption.)\n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home!

This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

Sadly after an emergency c section we lots all but one baby. \n\nSince then she has been busy nurturing and loving that one pup. \n\nSo being able to get a true read on how she is with other dogs has been difficult. \n\nShe lives in a foster home with other dogs and can see and hear them. But because of nursing she has no interest in meeting them. \n\nA meet with another dog in the home would be required and we do not think she will be friendly with other female dogs. \n\nShe did ignore the shelter cat prior to arriving in rescue. \n\nShe currently lives with 2 little girls and adores them. \n\nShe is very snuggly and sweet with people and prefers to be close to her humans. \n\nShe was a throw away momma who is ready for a forever home. \n\nShe is estimated to be 1 and 2 years old",

His owners were no longer able to care for him and relatives said they would but neglected him terribly. He is around 15 pounds underweight, his hips are protruding and his spine and ribs are visible. Also, is heart worm positive and it breaks our hearts. It may take us awhile to figure out his placement needs. \n\nBeau's adoption fee of $350.00 includes Vet exams, current vaccinations, flea treatment, fecal and heart worm test, both are positive. He is being treated for fecal parasites and will be treated for heart worms one he gains some weight. He will be neutered and microchipped.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

Her ears stick up when she is feeling happy and confident or curious. She has a HUGE smile and gives the biggest goober face when she's excited, she loves snuggling and getting cozy, she grooms herself like a cat, wiggles while she walks, and definitely bonds with her \"people\" once she's decided you're one of them, and is definitely the type to gaze up at you lovingly!\n\nWilma is crate trained, house trained and has been through a training program.  She is eager to please and cooperates with clear boundaries.  She is a smart girl who knows many basic commands, and loves treat puzzle toys to keep her stimulated.  Because she is dog selective, Wilma will need to be the only dog in the home.  Her leash manners are a work in progress,  but would love hikes and other outdoor activities.  Will would do best in a home without cats and with older children.   If you think Wilma would be the perfect addition to your home, you can apply at www.carolinaadoptabulls.com/adopt",

Men make me nervous at first, but if they are calm and patient I will warm up to them. I have never shown a bit of aggression, I would prefer to just walk away if a situation makes me uncomfortable. With other dogs I am: Good with other calm dogs. With cats I am: Good With children I am: Young children make me nervous, I would prefer to live with children 13 years or older. Potty-trained: Yes- with consistant potty breaks. Crate-trained: No Leash-trained: Yes, but will pull if he gets excited Tricks: Sit, lay down I have the following special needs: When Smokey Joe builds trust with his human friend, he is loving, playful, and affectionate. He takes some time to warm up to new people, but once he knows he is safe with you he makes a great canine companion. All dogs are tested for heartworms and given flea preventatives. They are also tested for intestinal parasites and receive routine dewormings. Dogs are vaccinated against distemper, rabies, and bordetella, spayed/neutered before adoption, and have a microchip. Adoption fees include the initial automated registration of the microchip at the time of adoption.",

I'm hoping to find an active person or family that can give me daily mental and physical exercise through training, games, interactive toys, and outdoor activities. As a Husky, I'm a natural Houdini, so you might not be able to trust me alone in your yard! If I go to a home with children, they'll need to be school-aged or older, as younger family members may be too overwhelming for me. If you're well versed in the Husky ways, looking for love and excitement in your life, I'm your kind of companion! Ryder will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Ryder A1366352 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

Tucker is a big ole puppy who hasn't learned all the things about manners yet and he is a little stressed out at the shelter. But our boy is super smart and treat motivated and he is already picking up new skills so we know he has the potential to be the perfect companion! Volunteers say he learning leash manners, is sweet and enjoys pets though he seems a little unaccustomed to it so far. When he met other dogs he was anxious and whiny but did engage in some play. As Tucker gets situated and his stress level improves we think he is really going to shine. Come check out this big puppy, diamond in the rough.",

Riley loves to play fetch and will bring the ball back to you with a smile on her face. She really enjoys being outside, and working for her treats. This sweet lady would like nothing more than to shower you with love. She came to the animal shelter when her owner could no longer care for her and she is ready to find her new home. Please call for an appointment to meet Miss Riley. If you have other dogs at home, please plan to bring them along for a meet 'n greet with her. Riley's adoption fee is $130. This includes her spay surgery, a microchip, age-appropriate vaccinations and 30 days of complimentary pet health insurance. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. We're excited to announce that our training classes have become virtual and are facilitated through Zoom meetings. See https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for more information about schedules and registration for online training classes. We are also offering support for recent adopters through our Trainer Talks also through Zoom meetings, prior registration is required.

            "description": "Maeve is a 1.5-2 year old husky/shepherd mix with big antenna ears that are soft as can be, and a goofy toothy grin. She is kennel trained and enjoys her \u2018den\u2019 when it\u2019s time to go to sleep. Maeve is potty trained - we are also trying to train her to ring bells when she needs let out. She knows the sit, \u2018go to kennel\u2019, and responds to her name (recalls) fairly well. Maeve is a bit independent but don\u2019t let that fool you - she is a cuddle monster. At first she may seem a bit picky with food but given time she will eat her meals and be more treat motivated. Maeve is good with other dogs and enjoys going to the doggy park. She also likes to play wrestle with her foster brother (cat) and sister (dog). Maeve still has a bit of puppy energy in her and will need her forever family to commit to professional training, as she is still learning some of the basic commands and tends to jump for attention. Because of this, she would do best in a home without small children and with a tall fully fenced yard. She is a gorgeous girl and melts hearts with her sweet kisses and full body wiggles. Please submit an application if you\u2019re interested in snuggles with a cute blonde!\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

            "description": "From my foster:\nStella is a sweet girl! Super treat motivated and will work for food! Her tail wags so hard from excitement that's it hard to not give in.\n\nCommand based training has been going fairly well. Sit is well understood, and she pretty much goes potty on command (very important to me). She's fairly typical for dogs in respect to where she goes in the yard, frequently in the same areas, so she's a creature of habit. At feeding, she's just now starting to understand that I get to put the food down without her face in the bowl... and oh my does she drool! On command she eats, I do 3 cups daily, 1.5c/feeding and she does well with that. She is very diurnal - at sunrise she wants to be fed, at first dark she wants to be fed, and this borders on demanding for this schedule.\n\nIn the car she's fantastic and observant. She likes sitting up and watching everything that happens. She doesn't do much with her head out the window, but she's very observant.\n\nOn walks, in the beginning she can tug or pull you along in her direction and focus. Once she's content that she's out walking she starts to listen a lot better. Heeling is very difficult, but with good repeated training she'll improve. So far she's not shot off after other dogs on walks, though when in proximity of 10ft she can pull very strongly. Her focus is her focus; I've not successfully pulled her focus away from something she wants to pay attention to, so she's very stubborn on that level. Best of course is just stay a street width away when she often doesn't notice or that distance is just too much effort for her to care too much.\n\nMy recommendations would be for an owner who has had dogs before, as a first dog she'll probably walk all over the owner with her stubbornness. Everyone's different, but she'll need a lot of patience and someone who will set boundaries full time for the rest of her life. She learns very slowly, and I can somewhat see that she'll fall out of it if relaxed. She sometimes has a guilty look when she's done something she thinks might be questionable... it's kinda cute and makes me wonder what happens sometimes. She also has ready command of her front paws. She'll scratch at doors or try to move barriers that block her way if she wants to be on the other side. She also dreams; loudly.\n\nCrate training hasn't been splendid but isn't terrible. Since I only have 1 bed that fits well, and that's the bed I keep in my office, I often have to move it so I'm a little lazy admittedly. She readily goes in, but she clearly doesn't like being alone most of all. She'll dig at the corner, but as of yet hasn't tried to break through the cage so that's something to watch for. Since I have a camera with audio, usually when she's getting a little rowdy I'll get on the speaker and tell her to settle down and she'll look confused, but then eventually calm down... maybe even lay down, but not very willingly.\n\nGiven I've been home a lot and she's very often with me she's kinda spoiled with company honestly. :)\n\nStella is best in an only dog home! She rather have all the attention to herself! We don't think she would share attention with cats either.\n\nLet's help her find a home!! She is a very sweet girl, also spent over 4 months at a local shelter until Hopalong came in!\n\n",

You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He is a great dog that will do well with any family. We prefer older children who can deal well with a large breed enthusiastic dog.\nPeter is dog selective - so we require an ONLY dog household with a fenced yard and please NO cats! An experienced dog person would work very well for Peter. \n\nPeter is housebroken, crate-trained, fully vetted - up-to-date on all shots and a good leash walker. Peter's adopt donation is $200.\n\nPeter is currently in Florida. We can arrange a video chat so you can view his behavior and interaction with his care-giver before deciding adopt. We can also arrange a door-to-door transport with our experienced rescue dog transporter who will provide a one-on-one intro to your household at a separate fee.\n\nPlease COPY and PASTE our LINK to our adopt application - we will respond immediately:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/GFS_nj/ADOPT_FOSTER_Application",

He is ready to start accepting applications and look for his forever home. \n\nHe is a funny guy that sneezes and moans when he wants attention and loves to be silly and roll around on his back when he is excited. Linus has excellent leash manners and knows some basic commands such as place, heel, and off. He is very food motivated and regularly tries to convince his foster that he hasn\u2019t had dinner yet. He is crate trained, muzzle trained, and has done well with potty training. \n\nLinus came to us with a history of using his teeth in situations that made him uncomfortable such as going to the groomer and guarding resources such as people\u2019s laps. \n\nWe have worked with him extensively on these things and he is now able to go to his groomer without issues and he knows how to get off of laps on command when sharing the couch with multiple people. He is also only allowed up when invited. \n\nHe has been fostered in a home with other animals and does okay with calm, neutral dogs however he would prefer to be the only dog in the home. He\u2019s not a fan of cats. Due to him having used his teeth in the past we will not be placing him in a home with children. \n\nHe\u2019s a cute, quirky boy that will thrive in a home that will give him lots of love as well as keeps up with his training and will provide structure and routine. His activity needs are low but he enjoys a daily walk. \n\nLinus is neutered, up to date on vaccines, neg hw test, and is up to date with preventatives. He is being fostered in Bloomington, Indiana. We are seeking a home for him within an hour of Bloomington, Indiana. His adoption fee is $150.\n\nPlease fill out an initial application if you are interested in him. \n\nhttps://forms.gle/hmA2LKTxn3hSMdST6",

            "description": "Meet Regal Roo!\n\nRoo is a gorgeous, mostly Thai Ridgeback mix hailing from the island of Koh Samui with a very sad history:  born on the street to a feral mom, she and her sister Lulu were the only 2 surviving pups from a litter of 6. Thankfully, Roo and her sister are okay and her mom has also been sterilized and continues to be fed and cared by their rescuer. Roo is now in Toronto and settling into her new life and she loves the snow! \n\nRoo is just under a year old (born March 2020) and still has lots of that that puppy-ness about her (good and bad!). She is inquisitive about everything, happy, friendly and easy-going. She loves other dogs and currently lives with 3 others with no issue. She can still be a destructive chewer and needs to be supervised. She loves her walks, is fine in the car and at the vet. She has settled into life with her foster family in the east end of Toronto fabulously.\n\nRoo is incredibly sweet, smart and loves to snuggle. She has already mastered her basic commands, knows the word treat and will occasionally take herself to the treat cupboard and tap it with her nose (she may be a bit too smart for her own good). She is also very active and athletic with zero fear of heights and has no issues trying to climb things, so a secure backyard with a high fence is a must for this girl. She also needs a family that will give her sufficient physical and mental stimulation, she's got that intelligent, working dog thing. She would love advanced obedience and a tricks and/or agility class.\n\nRoo weighs about 17.5 kilos, she may still have a bit of growing and filling out to do. She's housetrained, fully vetted, spayed, current on vaccinations (boosters just administered in Canada), 4Dx negative and micro-chipped. Roo is also crate trained. She will fuss initially, but settles quickly and will rest quietly in her crate for several hours. She would be fine as an only dog or with fur sibs. Due to her age, size and breed mix, no cats or young kids; dog-savvy kids 12+ would be fine as she loves to play and has loads of energy. Roo is available for adoption in the GTA only. This regal girl is a real treasure! Her adoption fee is 1500. 00. If you think you are a good match for Ms. Roo, we would love to hear from you!

He skin was a nasty mess but is healing well. She has completed treatment for heartworm and is now ready to find a family that will take good care of her forever! She is a tad shy at times but is really happy and active once she settles in. She has been non-reactive with other dogs and is fine with kids who are big enough not to be knocked over by her! We have not exposed her to cats. \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries.

Shelby is a gorgeous 7 year old Labrador Retriever/Border Collie mix with a sweet and lovable personality. This cutie absolutely loves to go for walks and sniff every exciting new scent she can find. She walks well on a leash, and would be happy to be your adventure girl - she'll show you how to truly enjoy life by stopping and smelling all the flowers along the way. She would enjoy nose work such as snuffle mats and other fun scent-focused games. She'll show off her goofy personality as she zooms around the yard and chases after plush toys and tennis balls. While she doesn't have the full game of fetch down, she absolutely loves to pounce after a toy and fling it around in the air - it's adorable (she just needs to learn to bring it back!). Shelby is a smarty pants and can definitely learn lots of new tricks and skills. She knows how to 'sit' and 'shake,' and can even catch a treat right out of the air. Shelby needs a home (no apartments, condos or townhomes please) with a securely fenced in yard and will need to be supervised at all times. She is a super smart pup who loves to go on adventures on her own- she has figured out how to open doors and gates, so she needs to be closely managed in her home. Shelby is looking for a home without children under the age of 12 (too overwhelming), and without chickens. She may do best in a home without cats. Shelby has lived with dogs before and does well with calm dogs. Shelby has a history of seizures and is currently on medication to help, which seems to be working well! Her adopters will need to be prepared to work with their own full-service vet to manage this in their home. Shelby can be stressed being left alone and is on medication to help with her anxiety. She would do best in a home with an adopter who is home often and can work with a trainer to help her overcome her anxiety. Shelby is ready for a forever home of her own - if you're ready make her part of your family, submit an application today!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Shelby, please email a completed adoption application to adoptions@kitsap-humane.org. Adoption applications and more information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.kitsap-humane.org/adopt/how-to-adopt/. Once your application has been received, you will be placed in line to have your application reviewed. All applicants are pre-screened over the phone, and then are scheduled for a time to come in and meet the dog at the shelter.\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 61lbs Age: 7yrs 1mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed",

I came to Rhodie\u2019s Rescue after the nice family I am staying with saved me from the streets. Because my family never came looking for me, my friends at Rhodie\u2019s are helping me to find the best new family who will keep me safe and love me forever! \nThey tell me I look like a long haired chihuahua or possibly a Papillion or Russian Toy mix. We won\u2019t know for sure without DNA testing, but one thing is for sure... I\u2019m super cute!! \nI\u2019m about 3-4 yrs of age and pretty tiny at about 5-6lbs. But don\u2019t let my size fool you! I can be a sassy girl when I feel like it! My friends tell me I have a \u2018Chihuahua attitude\u2019 so they feel my new family should be familiar or have experience with Chihuahuas as to handle my attitude. I\u2019m not really sure why, but I will growl when you pick me up, or pretty much anytime I\u2019m feeling sassy! I\u2019ve never snapped or but anyone, but there\u2019s always the possibility that could come next if you don\u2019t handle me correctly. That\u2019s why my friends and foster family don\u2019t want me to be in a home with kids. \nI\u2019m like other dogs, but I\u2019m pretty dominant around other dogs. I will stand on my hind legs and place my front paws on them and growl/bark. I also chase them and nip at their legs when they are running... I sometimes think I\u2019m a tough big dog, and my current foster siblings \u2018put up\u2019 with me, but I will definitely get hurt if another dog retaliates after I have been provoking them... so my friends say I need to be an only dog in my new home, but I can definitely join my doggie friends for a walk or play date. \nI love to sit on laps and cuddle. I\u2019m a pretty good kisser too, and it\u2019s hard to resist me! \nI like to run and play, and going on leash walks is my favorite thing to do! \nI know not to potty in the house, but sometimes I get excited and tinkle a little. I sleep in a crate, but I would really prefer to sleep in bed with you! \nI love my humans and hope my new family is home to spend lots of time with me, and active enough to keep up with my energy while playing and never miss my daily walks I look so forward to! \nMy adoption fee is $350 which includes health examination, current vaccinations, spay, microchip, flea and deworming treatment along with any other medical or dental deemed necessary by our veterinarian.",

At SDHS:This pet has been microchipped, spayed, and is up to date on vaccinations. They are now ready for their new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Abbie: the goofy, lovable pittie who would love to find a comfortable home to call her own! This silly gal will make you smile with her lovable grin and wiggly body. She's got the kind of personality that will brighten even the darkest of days! Abbie has had a lot of change this past year, but she's hoping to turn that around. She's rambunctious, playful, and friendly with everyone she meets. While she has done well with dogs off-leash, she can get a little too excited on leash. Because of this, she might do well as the only pet in the home, but if you have another dog, Abbie would like to meet them before adoption to make sure they can be friends. This gal really enjoys being outside and would make a great hiking or camping buddy! Does she seem like the one for you? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started! \n\n\n Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Weight: 59lbs Age: 8yrs 6mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "This little sweet thing is Kolache.  She is about two months old and will be ready to go to her forever home on 2/4/21.  She is here at the shelter now and can have visitors and be adopted but will have to stay with us until that date.  She is a Siberian Husky mix (with what we don't know). \n\nSocial, NOT housebroken, good with other dogs, young enough to train with cats.  Good with kids and adults.  Puppies are what their families make of them - the more work you put in the better the adult dog you will have.  If you don't have time (and it takes a lot) for a puppy - don't get one.  They are definitely work.   With their breed mix they are vocal pups.\n\nIn order to visit you have to have submitted an application and been tentatively approved.  You will find the application on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com and it is under the Adoption tab. Adoption fees on puppies is $275.00.  That includes spay/neuter, current puppy shots, worming and micro-chip.  Puppies will require balance of puppy shots so you will have vet bills on them in the next two months to complete their shots.\n\nA fenced in yard is preferable but will not be mandatory depending upon the plan for exercise.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do your research on Siberian Huskies before you decide you want one just because they are beautiful.   They are really not a dog for the inexperienced person and they are not apartment dogs typically.  Our adoption counselors will ask enough questions to determine if you have done your homework on the breed.\n\n",

            "description": "Have you met Chopstix?\n\n5-year-old Chopstix came to us on July 3, 2020 from a hoarding situation that resulted in uncontrolled breeding and 60 very similar looking dogs. Choppy has cerebellar hypoplasia, an underdeveloped brain stem impacting his motor function. This means Chopstix can't walk or stand for more than a few seconds and wobbles his way around. Despite this, Choppy is the sweetest, happiest little floof! He has a huge heart and is so determined. He has been working with a physical therapist who volunteers at FFF and making progress using wheels to aid in his mobility. (Be sure to watch the video!)\n\nChoppy has a big fan club, and a FFF volunteer who has neuro dogs of her own, takes him on outings nearly every weekend. They've gone boating, swimming, and hiking, just to name a few! She shared, \"I'll be honest, I spent a lot of time thinking about the things I could write about Choppy and what makes him wonderful. I could hit the usual beats and say he's adorable, he's sweet and loving, he always wants to play, and even though he can't walk, he loves to sit in his carrier and go on adventures. I could add that he spent 5 years of his life in a neglectful situation, likely never knowing real human affection and care. I could add that he gets the gist of peeing and pooping outside, and that he's a friend to cats. But I could say this about SO many dogs, all deserving of forever homes, and it wouldn't capture what makes Choppy so special to me (and what I hope will one day make him special to his future family).\n\nI also thought about what might stop people from taking Choppy home. I will be totally honest with anyone who asks - Choppy will be more work than your average dog. His cerebellar hypoplasia is significant enough that he can't walk and sometimes needs a little help doing the day-to-day tasks that other dogs don't even have to think about doing. That means help getting around, helping standing up to pee/poo, and sometimes a little assist while eating. But oh man - when that little golden fluffy face looks at you and nuzzles into your chest in gratitude and in love, there's no feeling like it.\"\n\nDogs with cerebellar hypoplasia\n\ncan be a lot of work, but it is oh-so-rewarding. Think\n\nyou might be up for it?

She is a 6-month-old, 21 pound Labrador Retriever/Mountain Cur mix (best guess) with a shiny black coat. Athena enjoys playtime and is always up for a game of chase or tug. She gets along great with other dogs and cats too. Athena would do her best in an active home where she can get lots of interaction. She is eager to please and treat motivated. Athena is doing well with crate training and working hard on her other obedience skills and needs a new family who is ready to continue her training. She is a touch timid when she first meets new people and in new places but warms up once she knows you are all about fun and affection. If you are seeking a sweet, medium-sized canine companion to add to your heart and home, apply to adopt Athena today!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

She is here at the shelter now and can have visitors and be adopted but will have to stay with us until that date.  She is a Siberian Husky mix (with what we don't know). \n\nSocial, NOT housebroken, good with other dogs, young enough to train with cats.  Good with kids and adults.  Puppies are what their families make of them - the more work you put in the better the adult dog you will have.  If you don't have time (and it takes a lot) for a puppy - don't get one.  They are definitely work.   With their breed mix they are vocal pups.\n\nIn order to visit you have to have submitted an application and been tentatively approved.  You will find the application on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com and it is under the Adoption tab. Adoption fees on puppies is $275.00.  That includes spay/neuter, current puppy shots, worming and micro-chip.  Puppies will require balance of puppy shots so you will have vet bills on them in the next two months to complete their shots.\n\nA fenced in yard is preferable but will not be mandatory depending upon the plan for exercise.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do your research on Siberian Huskies before you decide you want one just because they are beautiful.   They are really not a dog for the inexperienced person and they are not apartment dogs typically.  Our adoption counselors will ask enough questions to determine if you have done your homework on the breed.\n\n",

            "description": "\n\nSweet Isa is a petite 2 year old female terrier/hound mix at only about 22-24 pounds. She had a rough start in life, but has done extraordinarily well in her foster home getting used to living indoors (her manners are actually great!), discovering the purpose of toys and learning to trust to the resident dogs and young children. She loves belly rubs and to wedge her way onto your lap to snuggle. She recently weaned a litter of puppies, so she is working on getting her figure back, but doesn\u2019t seem to mind. Isa is crate trained/tolerant, and hasn\u2019t had any accidents inside, as she seems to be following the lead of the foster\u2019s resident pups. \n\nIsa would make a great addition to any family, adult only, or one including one with kids and/or other dogs. She doesn\u2019t have any known experience with cats yet, though based on her behavioral tendencies and openness to learning/trust, we think she\u2019d be fine with them!",

The loud noises and movements of kids are scary for Millie. It would be best for her to be in a quieter home and have kids in their teenage years. Millie was given away on Craigs list and the family who gave her away didn't mention anything about her fear of kids, The most recent family wants her to find a great home,  said that she lived with another dog and good with cats. We have not cat tested, so we can not confirm. They said she is a big couch potato and loves to be petted and cuddle. She was never crated and has a tendency towards females mostly.

She is here at the shelter now and can have visitors and be adopted but will have to stay with us until that date.  She is a Siberian Husky mix (with what we don't know). \n\nSocial, NOT housebroken, good with other dogs, young enough to train with cats.  Good with kids and adults.  Puppies are what their families make of them - the more work you put in the better the adult dog you will have.  If you don't have time (and it takes a lot) for a puppy - don't get one.  They are definitely work.   With their breed mix they are vocal pups.\n\nIn order to visit you have to have submitted an application and been tentatively approved.  You will find the application on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com and it is under the Adoption tab. Adoption fees on puppies is $275.00.  That includes spay/neuter, current puppy shots, worming and micro-chip.  Puppies will require balance of puppy shots so you will have vet bills on them in the next two months to complete their shots.\n\nA fenced in yard is preferable but will not be mandatory depending upon the plan for exercise.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do your research on Siberian Huskies before you decide you want one just because they are beautiful.   They are really not a dog for the inexperienced person and they are not apartment dogs typically.  Our adoption counselors will ask enough questions to determine if you have done your homework on the breed.",

Luckly, she was a candidate for an \"FHO surgery\" which a skilled vet performed.  She has been given a clean bill of health and is learning that she can reliably use her new leg without hurting.  Lucky her spunky nature and confident attitude kept her going and even when in pain, it never slowed her down.  Now that she is pain free, she runs like the wind to catch up for lost time.  She plays well with her siblings, other dogs and cats and is learning the house rules.  She is going through her chewing stage and will need lots of safe chew toys and interaction.  She would love an attached secure fenced yard and someone to keep her entertained and challenged during the day as she is one smart curious girl.  Please contact 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net for a pre-adopt ap that starts the process so you can meet her.",

She is good with other dogs and kids, but she does tend to herd them so she would need patient dog friends and older kids that understand what she is doing. Angel has never been around cats so we aren't sure how she does with them. Angel is still learning how to be fully potty trained and her previous family (they had her for 2 months) told us that she is doing really well and will walk in circles when she needs to go outside. Angel does have some separation anxiety and will bark/whine when left alone and she tends to chew things up if she isn't in her kennel. Angel does well on car rides and walks well on a leash but needs a little bit more training so that she doesn't pull. Angel was described as friendly, playful, shy/timid at first, quiet, high energy, and cuddly. Her favorite toys are ropes, balls, and squeaky toys. If you would like to meet Angel give us a call!",

However, in a short amount of time he has shown to be timid and shy at first but will show his playful side once he gets to know you. Mr. Magoo will prove to be an amazing, loyal dog--he just needs a home that will give him time to adjust to new surroundings. Won't you give this great guy a chance? He's waiting to meet you!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

            "description": "I'M CURRENTLY ON HOLD, PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT! Meet Nova! This adorable 7-month-old pup came to us when her previous guardian could no longer care for her. Nova loves to play! And she is learning how to play with other dogs and having the best time in playgroup. She weighs about 47 pounds now but could weigh up to 60-65 pounds as an adult. Nova's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Nova or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are half-price for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

He is learning the house rules and is crate trained.  He plays well with other dogs and loves his run time in the yard.  Bear would enjoy a sibling dog friend and someone to give him the love he deserves.  We ask for a secure attached fenced yard and someone with some \"at home time\" to further his training and socializing.  Please request our pre-adopt form which starts the process so you can meet this cutie. For information please contact 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net",

He does get \"little man syndrome\" around big dogs, but does well with dogs his size. Lucas adores kiddos(my kids are 10, 9, and 6). He occasionally gets the \"zoomies\" if encouraged and loves to play once he builds trust with you. Lucas does get a bit territorial over his bed, food, treats, and toys; but is over all a little lover! Lucas is crate trained and does okay on a leash. If taken out on a regular schedule he has little to no accidents. Lucas is a 4 year old chihuahua mix. \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

            "description": "Annie is a very sweet intelligent active girl.  She'll need her humans to be active and keep her busy with challenging activities.  She loves to go for long walks, play fetch and do all the agility equipment at the shelter.  She is not a big fan of other dogs so will need to your one and only.  Probably not a match for cats either.  She will need a household where children are significantly older and know how to interact appropriately with high energy dogs.  She is house-trained.\n\nBy the way, she is spayed, microchipped, and current on all shots -- all ready for a new home.\n\nFor more information about me, please call the Douglas County Animal Care and Services (DCACS) at 775-782-9061 or the Douglas Animal Welfare Group (DAWG) at 775-267-7325. Or come meet her at the Douglas County Animal Shelter (please call first to make sure I'm still at the shelter). Click on Douglas Animal Welfare Group below for the address and directions.\n\nALSO A \"MEET AND GREET\" WILL BE REQUIRED IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER DOGS IN THE HOUSEHOLD. \n\nONE LAST THING! If you rent, you will be required to provide written approval from your landlord that you can have a dog. It needs to be specific, i.e. all dogs okay, no big dogs, specific breeds restricted, etc.",

            "description": "Happy Birthday Gary Groot!My siblings and I decided to sponsor this life saving transport to honor our father's 81st birthday. Our father, Gary Groot, is the main reason we are all animal lovers. We grew up watching and learning how to properly pamper our puppies and he instilled in us the importance of adoption; how it saves lives. My father just lost his beloved Precious who he loved with all his heart and took her everywhere, even bought a travel trailer so she could join him on mission projects for the church. Precious was by his side for the last 15 years and will now wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge. Suzanne, Karen & Tom\nKaren and her siblings were born around September 7, 2020, and may top out in the 65-75 pound range when done growing. These adorable furballs look a lot like GSD and Husky pups but there could be several breeds mixed in as well. They are happy, active, social, pups and they are ready to find their perfect forever homes!\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $550.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

The decision was made out of care and for the success of Kaias future; hoping that her forever family will have the time, resources and environment to give Kaia the proper training, socialization and consistency to bring out all of her amazing qualities. \n\n \n\nKaia would do best in a home with older, dog-savvy children who understand not to overwhelm her as she develops and learns through her training. With Kaias incredible smarts and energy we believe an experienced home with a yard she can run and grow in would be a great fit. Kaia is playful, loves to run, go on walks and loves to be around people.

A kind neighbor rescued him and now he\u2019s ready to move on to the next phase of his life in a forever home. At only 1.5 years of age and 34 lbs, he is energetic, playful, friendly with people, sweet, friendly with other dogs although he may need some additional socialization. He is non-reactive to cats so could be properly cat-tested and may prove to be compatible. E.L. Fudge would do well in a home with active people, children of about 8 yrs and older, potentially with the right companion dog. He\u2019s very adaptable and with structure in his life and more socialization he will be the most amazing, confident pup you could hope to have in your life.",

            "description": "This little girl was found by a Good Samaritan. She was acting weird, so they took her to the vet. What they discovered makes us absolutely sick to our stomach. This little 14 lb dog was overdosing on methamphetamine. The veterinarian gave her medicine to get the drugs out of her system and bring her out of her high, but she is now blind. She also has a funny walk, but it just adds to her cuteness! She is about 6 years old and is a Chihuahua/Pekingese/Mini Dachshund/Pomeranian mix. Although Indie is now blind, she is not letting her situation get her down and is a happy and super sweet girl! She is now fully vetted and ready to find her forever home! Her ideal home would be without young children. Although she loves everyone, she needs a home that is free of toys and obstacles. She would be fine in a home with a laid back small dog or even without another dog. She is currently in a foster home with other dogs and just co-exists with them. Occasionally she will try to play with them, but doesn't really understand how to play. She has a halo, which she wears in a new environment for the first day or two, but then she gets around just fine without it. She needs someone that is home or works from home most of the time. She sleeps in her kennel at night and doesn't make a peep. She is potty trained, but needs you to guide her with noises out to the backyard. No apartments please, it is not safe for her to do stairs and the commotion of a lot of different people and dogs would be overwhelming to her. \n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91767055990166 \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex. We are dedicated to rescuing dogs in shelters, dogs in abusive or neglectful situations, and dogs surrendered by their owners because of difficult circumstances. We place dogs in loving, responsible, committed permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process, which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a dog into their homes and lives. Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, microchipped, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment, and placed in nurturing foster homes while they await placement in their permanent homes. We assist dogs in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. Dogs in the greatest need take priority. Finally, we strive to work with shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless dogs.",

It took her a while to adjust. You can also tell by the way she acts that she had a rough life. It is believed that she was abused and also that she was hit by a car when pregnant. She is doing great now. She looks much better. She is more trusting and protective towards her foster family. She doesnt have an aggressive bone in her body. She protects with her bark but would never come after anyone. She is kennel trained. She is the best escape artist I have ever seen. She can get out of any cage even when extra precautions are taken. She is such a smart dog. She gets along with other dogs well and isnt sure what to think about cats. She is good with children as well. She deserves a great family that will love and take care of her forever.",

If you go hiking or jogging or love dog parks this is your guy. He is super friendly to all humans and is non reactionary when lil dogs have run up on him. He is food motivated and learns fast.

            "description": "0121078\n\nI seem to be part pittie, so I need a single family home. I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions.\n\nHi! Im Striker aka Strikes.\n\nStriker is a 11 week young, lab mix puppy, he came from Houston TX! Hes currently getting over a really bad rash but his skin is healing nicely and his fur is coming in so smooth. However, because his skin hurts, he does not like to be handled a lot right now and is a bit skittish. We are working on cuddles, lovings and kisses- all the time! He has came out of his shell so much in the short amount of time we have had him. He loves play time with his other doggie friends. He would probably prefer a doggie sibling, he is learning everyday how to dog. He eats 3 times a day and will do anything for his treats. He is completely potty trained for the backyard but will use a potty pad indoors in case of emergencies. He is sooo smart and is catching on great to the normal daily routine. He is great at taking his medicine and getting special baths. Hes got the cutest black and brown cheeks with spots of black all over, with a mostly white coat. He has the cutest little black mask on with an adorable little spotted nose He has this awesome Mohawk on his neck, so unique. He is the sweetest boy and deserves a wonderful forever home. Does yours sound like the perfect fit?",

Heartworm is NOT contagious. The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n\nSweet Marshall is a 4 year old Staffordshire Terrier x. He appears to have Pitbull in him. \nHes a small guy standing about 16 at the shoulders. We nicknamed him Meatball because, well, it just fits. This cutie will follow you around the house. He will do just about anything you ask as he just wants to make you happy. He learned sit, stand, lay, and down within the first few days in foster. \n\nHe loves people and no one is a stranger to him. He got along well with other large/ medium sized dogs both male and female. We are unsure about small dogs. He needs to be in a home without a cat.\n\nMarshall walks great on a leash. He doesnt pull at all and loves his daily walks. \nMarshall doesnt really know how to play so you have to show him, then he will follow your lead.\n\nHe was recently neutered and had a few incidents with marking in the house. We remedied this by crate training. So the first few days you may have to remind him not to mark by crating him. This isnt a big deal though, because he really does love his crate. \n\nGet your application in soon because this guy will be adopted quickly. He captured my heart. He is the goodest boy and is just waiting to find his forever family.",

            "description": "Sadie is an amazing dog! She is a German Shepherd/Aussie mix, and just about 3-4 years old, and 40lbs. Sadie is amazing with children (even babies!) and adults - all people in general. She is also fully potty trained, and leash trained. She does not need to be crated, as she never chews anything up. Sadie is currently in foster care with 4 small children (two under a year old and two 5 years old) and does amazing with them! She is very sweet and friendly and gentle.\n\nSadie was never properly socialized with dogs, so she doesn't know how to get along with other dogs. She will bark (on leash) when she sees another dog, and since she is leash reactive, her foster has never wanted to try her off leash with dogs. We think given time, training, and slow introductions, she should be able to overcome it with an adopter willing to work with her. We would love to find her a home where she is the only dog, and ideally with someone less active, and with a large yard or acreage for Sadie to have for exercise and play.\n\nThe following is written about her by her current foster: Please read it all before inquiring about Sadie!\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\u201cSadie has been friendly and calm around all people since the day we picked her up. She has even done very well when around my two 10 month old grandsons (pictured) and my two 5 year old grandsons. She doesn\u2019t mind them petting her or sitting with her. She often lays near them while they are playing. She has been left at home alone several times for maybe 3 hours max and has done well \u2013 as long as no food has been left on the kitchen counters. I always give her a Kong, snuffle mat or chew stick to distract her when I leave. Initially she would be excited/nervous when I left but she is much better now. Sadie sleeps in our bedroom with us \u2013 either in our walkin closet, on her bed or on the floor next to our bed. She only gets up on our bed in the morning when we awake.\n\nSadie was fully potty trained when we received her. She does not let us know when she needs out but since we have been home mostly she is in and out a lot during the day and this has not been an issue \u2013 she also seems to be able to \u201chold it\u201d well. She very rarely will bark and then it only seems to be when she is surprised by something. When she sees other dogs she will whine and pull to go towards them. Unfortunately her overstimulation around dogs can become too much if they make contact, typically. Sadie walks well on the leash with her \u201cno pull\u201d harness. Sadie does very well traveling in the car on the back seat.\n\nSadie can get over a 4 foot fence or wall when she is motivated, so never leave her unattended in the yard. A 6 foot fence is a must! As long as she is entertained and engaging with someone, she has no reason to want to try to jump.\n\nSadie has been very trainable since we received her. She has learned the \u201csit\u201d command and will typically stay sitting until I release her with the word \u201cOK\u201d. We have been working on learning \u201clie down\u201d.\n\nSadie will play tug a war and will release the rope when asked to. She also will play fetch and will typically drop the ball when asked to do so. We have been working on her self control. When I feed her I ask her to sit before putting her bowl down. I put the bowl on the floor and she will stay sitting and not go for the food until I release her with \u201cok\u201d. She does this quite well now. When she does something she is not supposed to I use the words \u201ceh, eh\u201d and she will typically stop or back off. When I call her by name she will typically respond right away and come to me. We have been working on \u201ccounter conditioning\u201d her to get her to be more under control when seeing other dogs. She has definitely improved over the past 2 months and will sit and stay mostly calm \u2013 from a distance \u2013 as the dog/s go by. Her best training treat is anything cheese-flavored, which she loves!\n\nShe has been so calm and sweet with all people and even with my young grandsons. The problem is she gets too overstimulated when seeing other dogs, that it turns into wanting to go after them. She just can\u2019t be around dogs. Someone who is retired and has a large yard would be perfect for her. I say this because keeping her from going on walks might be best -if you do, when walking on a path or trail and passing another dog you need to keep a good distance between them and a strong hand on her leash. Other than the \u201cdog\u201d issue she has been a great dog to have around.\u201d\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWe are searching for Sadie\u2019s forever home with an individual or family who has no other pets, and can commit to working with Sadie\u2019s issue of not being able to be around other dogs.\n\nSadie\u2019s adoption fee is $200 and that will include a harness, food, treats, toys, all of her shots, and her spay.\n\nIf you are interested in being this loving girl\u2019s forever home, please fill out an application here: https://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/",

            "description": "The state puppies are 8 of the cutest and fattest little fur balls you will ever see!\n\nWe rescued their mama Cali (and her pregnant daughter Molly) from the streets of Tijuana. A Good Samaritan took them in temporarily while his friends tried to find a rescue. We were so lucky to find them!\n\nCali is an incredible mama. She is sweet and attentive, but sometimes prefers that visitors give her all the attention! We\u2019re guessing she\u2019s a cattle dog pit mix, although none of her pups have her coloring. We\u2019re guessing (which is a rough guess as this early stage) that they will weigh about 50-70 pounds when fully grown.\n\nThere are 6 boys (Texas Dakota Alaska Hawaii Kansas and Tennessee) and 2 girls (Georgia and Montana). They\u2019re just three weeks old and wouldn\u2019t be ready to go home for another few weeks, but we wanted to post them to give potential adopters a chance to meet them at this incredible stage. \n\nOur adoption fee is 750 and includes all three rounds of puppy vaccines (including a neo natal Parvo vaccine for added immunity), full health checks before being adopted, deworming, and having them fixed and microchipped with snpla around 6 months old.\n\nPlease download an application from our website, or shoot us an email if you\u2019re interested in the state pups.\n\nThank you!",

My name is Frances and I can't wait to find the perfect forever-family to call my very own. What am I looking for? Well, cuddles, treats, fun and gamesall the things a puppy loves!\n\nI'm very sweet and gentle-natured, but I'm also full of puppy spirit and I appreciate a good game of \"Steal Your Slippers\" or \"Tug On Your Pant Leg.\" I love the snow and racing around in circles in the yard. I'm very adventurous outside and enjoy climbing snow drifts, chasing leaves, and fetching little sticks.\n\nBut all that energy wears a good girl out! I love to get scooped up for kisses and then settle in on the couch for a movie and a nap. I hang out quietly in my kennel near foster mom during the day while she works from home. I nap and play with toys until she lets me out for a break. And I'm pretty good at night too - making it six or more hours before letting you know it's time to potty. I'm a fast learner and haven't had any accidents in my kennel so far; and only a couple in the house - oops, sorry!\n\nI have two adult dog foster sisters, and I LOVE them so much! I love to wrestle and play tug and chase with them - I'm sure I'd love to have a doggie brother or sister in my new home.\n\nI really think I'm the perfect puppy and will grow up to be the BEST girl! If that's what you're looking for, then I can't wait to meet you!\n\nXOXO - Frannie\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

We think that our heartworm dogs have just as much to offer their new adopters as any other dog and they deserve a chance at life! Heartworm disease is relatively common in the United States, so we are in need of caring adopters like YOU that are willing to open their home to a dog with heartworm disease. You are truly saving a life by adopting a heartworm positive dog!\n\nAll heartworm treatment expenses are the responsibility of the adopter.Due to COVID-19 protocols have changed.\n\nAdoptions: If a person would like to adopt a pet, we encourage you to continue to monitor our website, which features our adoptable animals, and to also monitor our adoptable pet posts on our Facebook page. If you see a pet that you would like to adopt, you must now contact the shelter during open business hoursto arrange an appointmentfor a private meet and greet and to fill out the necessary paperwork.\n\nWhen arriving for your scheduled appointment please give us a call from the parking lot or ring our front doorbell.

This big, young (about 2-year-old) black and tan male may take a bit to warm up to you and other dogs, and definitely doesn't like cats. Like Bacall, he has not been well-socialized and will need a little patience until he finds his way and feels secure. But the great news is that he's treat motivated (aren't we all!) and is a quick-learner. He is making progress walking on a leash and actually does pretty well!\n\nIf you can give Bogart  an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\nWe will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.",

Our Angie is a playful Terrier mix who wants to be a velcro dog preferring to be with humans to dogs. She prefers male dogs to females and would do best with dogs her size or larger. \n\nAngie's adoption fee of $350.00 includes her Vet exam, current vaccinations, flea treatment, heart worm and fecal test. She has tested negative for both. She is spayed and microchipped.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

Rex came to us as a stray so we do not know much about his back story, but we do know that this fun loving boy loves everyone he meets and has done good with other dogs, but sometimes his play style can be overwhelming to them. If you have another dog at home and a dog meet and greet would be recommended to see if they were to get along. Rex will need a home with no cats/small animals as he gets too excited and will chase them. A home with only older children is also recommended due to his high energy and jumping. Rex's adoption fee is $200.00 which covers his neuter, vaccines, heartworm and tick testing as well as heartworm preventative and microchipping. If you are interested in Rex please email jrein@carrollcountymd.gov for an application. Once approved applications are received we will be able to set up an appointment with the approved adopter to come and meet him and see if he is the right fit for you.",

It takes him a minute to open up to you but when he does, he is energetic and playful. He loves to run, run and run. He will chase a ball (doesn't bring it back). He has been fine with other dogs (bring your dog with you if you want to meet him). Kit Kat does NOT LIKE CATS. Kit Kat loves a belly rub.

            "description": "Meet June! This darling Terrier mix puppy is looking for a family to call her own! June is a sweet, shy gal who quietly greets everyone she meets with a gentle tail wag. June enjoys spending her days exploring all the sniffs there are to find on her neighborhood walks, and patrolling for squirrels in the backyard. She would be a great companion on weekend trips to the lake, or hiking on nature trails throughout the area. \n\nJune is looking for a family who enjoys activity and exercise as much as she does. When not going on adventures with her person, June happily romps around the yard, playing with toys - stuffed toys are particularly fun! She loves to chase thrown toys, but is still learning how to bring them back! \n\nJune is working hard on learning all the things \"good dogs\" need to know - like leash manners and sitting when asked - and would love for her new family to continue her manners training. This smart girl is treat motivated, and eager to please! June enjoys the company of other dogs, and would love to have a playmate or two in her forever home.\n\nHer foster reports, \"She's very sweet and loving and she LOVES her treats. She also loves to cuddle and will give hugs (of sorts) if you kneel down to greet her.\" June can be nervous about meeting new people, and will do best in a home, with older children, that will give her the time (and tasty treats!) she needs to make new friends. If you are looking for an active, fun loving companion, June is the one for you - schedule an adoption appointment today!\n\nTo learn more about June, watch this video: https://youtu.be/ihDs6tedlGM",

He is great with other dogs and kids. He is a super sweet boy and travels well in a vehicle. He will need basic training, but he is an absolute lover and likes to give hugs. He is learning the crate, but does protest vocally but does settle down, so shared wall living would not be recommended. Rudy does like to chase squirrels, but has lived in a home with a dog saavy cat just fine. He is high energy, so small kids could get knocked over if he jumps up. He's very treat motivated and knows basic commands. A home that has a large fenced yard or acreage would be ideal for this boy who wants to greet everyone to say 'hello' and does not want to miss any activity happening outdoors. He enjoys running in the yard or going for walks, so if you're looking for a partner, this is your boy; although he will still need some additional leashwork before a run would be possible.Priority will go to applicant who can bring him to a vet visit in Golden Valley, MN prior to adoption.

ADOPTION IS $150.00.\n\n\nThis little one is Twinkle. She, along with her sister ,were left at the door of a shelter. Both were so cold and very young. They are  the sweetest pups ever!\nTwinkle looks like a terrier mix, she is tiny: weighing in at just 5 pounds as of 1/23/21. The best guess we have for adult weight would be around 30-40 pounds based on her size now, and rate of growth. When we first got her she was just 2.5 pounds. That was 12/22/20. \nShe is a snuggly bunny, she is cate trained, she is good with other dogs but can be scared of very large dogs. Due to her small size we will not place her in a home with large dogs  nor children under 10 years  age. \nShe will be spayed prior to adoption, and she is also microchipped. She has been started on heartworm and flea prevention as well. \nShe does like having the yard at her foster home to play in and needs another dog to help keep her company when her humans are away and she likes the  security of it as well. \nTwinkle is in Memphis.\n",

            "description": "Meet Rocco! Rocco wants nothing more than to be loved. He adores people but can be standoffish around most people at first - with proper introductions, his desire for affection quickly wins out and he will be your best friend. You'll get to know his excitement by how vocal he can get and a rapid tail wag, but he quickly settles down. He does have minor food aggression behavior that is currently being worked on and he doesn't enjoy new friends hovering overhead. Due to this, he needs a home with no children (16+ is acceptable). He loves playing with toys and craves attention! He also loves head scratches and holding his paws in your hands. He is potty and crate trained; he enjoys being in his crate because it is his safe space. Rocco will start to chew if left unsupervised, but a kong ball works very well to keep him occupied. Rocco is not an expert at leash walking, but he tries his hardest to behave. At the start he may pull a little, but he has been previously trained with a prong collar to sense the added pressure and halt or move closer to you as the walks progresses. He can sit, lay down, and give paw(s). He is extremely loving and loves other dogs - he just wants to play! Since Rocco needs room to run and play, you must have a fenced in yard (at least 5 feet tall) to apply for Rocco. Rocco would also do best in an active home that will help him get his energy out and keep his mind stimulated.\n\nNote: Rocco has been in 2 foster homes where he experienced no issues and truly thrived. When he has clear and firm boundaries, he learns to trust his owner and rely on them for guidance. He was adopted out twice to homes that unfortunately could not set these boundaries and establish themselves as the leader, which caused Rocco to take on that role and \"rule the roost\". He has completed board and train with our wonderful trainer who believes that he will thrive with someone who will exhibit strong leadership skills, patience, and understanding. Hes done amazing with our trainer and is ready for a foster or maybe even a forever home!\n\nOnce again, we must express that this goofy boy will need an experienced dog owner that will exhibit strong leadership skills. His trainer says, \"He needs someone that is going to focus on rules and boundaries, the affection secondary. If you try affection primarily, he is going to rule the roost.\" With effective leadership, we know that this goofy boy will thrive and prove just how awesome of a dog he is!\n\nOur adoption process for Rocco will consist of:\n-completing our online application\n-initial phone interview\n-vet check (if applicant has existing pets)\n-reference check\n-home check (will be either in person or via facetime or zoom)\n-final phone interview\n-meet and greet\n-In-home training sessions with our trainer once Rocco has settled in.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rocco, please fill out an application at lastdaydogs.com. If you have any questions, please send an email to adopt@totuanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Ramsey is a 1.5 year old Havanese poodle mix! Ramsey and his brother were surrendered to a local shelter in Texas Heartworm positive. Both boys have been successfully treated and are medically clear for adoption. They will need to remain on preventative for their lifetime which is fairly inexpensive depending on the brand you choose. They are otherwise healthy, happy boys!\n\nRamsey is a little lover. He is smart and active. He loves people more then anything and is very very cuddly. He wants nothing more then to be loved. He often times lays on the back of the couch so he can rest his head on your shoulder and if you stop petting him he has no problem using his paw to remind you to keep going. He is crate trained and does go outside to use the bathroom BUT he does also Mark inside! He is freshly neutered so we hope this improves but we can never guarantee that it will and we want to be perfectly honest about this! Please do NOT expect a house trained dog and please be willing to put in the time and effort to properly train him. He does wear a belly band without any issues and stands nicely for you to put it on. He has a doggy door and a fenced in yard at his foster home and does well with that set up.\n\nRamsey likes other dogs but he is very dominant with them. He also guards his food in the crate but he can take treats nicely in a group. He is crate trained but he will bark initially and cry sometimes when he is in it because he only wants to be with you. He does not have cats in his foster home so we have not tested him with them. He has been around children and has been totally loving to them. He is very well behaved for grooming and did wonderful for his bath.\n\nRamsey does bark sometimes when he is excited or when someone comes over or if he has been in the crate for a while but when he is out with his family he is generally pretty quiet. He likes to play with toys. He loves using the agility equipment in his foster home and is pretty good at it.\n\nHe is very agile, he likes to climb and jump. He has climbed baby gates and the chain link fence in his foster home chasing a squirrel therefore if you have a fence it will need to be a privacy fence. No invisible or electric fences. Ramsey is a great little dog. He is very submissive to humans and wants nothing more then to find a loving family of his own.\n\nIf you think Ramsey is a match for your family don't hesitate to apply!\n\nRamsey is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and treated for heartworm. His adoption fee is $450",

            "description": "Citrine cane to rescue from a SD reservation.  He was born on 8.6.2020.  He will be neutered by 6 months of age. He responds to the name of ASH and weighs 45#. He came to rescue with other puppies and his momma. His adoption fee is $350.00.\n\nHi! I\u2019m Ash and I\u2019m looking for my Furever home. If you are looking for a well-balanced, smart, and loving pup, I am your dog. My days consist of a lot of napping and playing with my older foster sister. She is also a shepherd mix. We like to chase each other. Do you have a brother or sister for me I can play with? That would be nice because when I am awake, I have a lot of energy. Give me some squeaky toys and I am set for life!   \n\nWhen my humans leave me in my kennel, sometimes I cry and howl, but only when I\u2019m left alone. I sleep really well in my kennel though, I sometimes cry at night but mainly because I need to go potty. They say I am a good boy and have taught me a ton!  My humans have taught me sit, down, stay, come, off, no, speak, \u201chigh five\u201d, and heel. They also taught me how to ring a bell when I need to go potty,  but I like to stare at them instead of using it. They say I am potty trained. \n\nI had some issues with my tummy for a while, but I am on the mend. Just don't make too many sudden changes to my diet. With that being said, I am extremely food motivated, but I am learning my mealtime manners. Before I am fed, I must sit patiently before they say \u201cok\u201d. \n\n Please adopt me. I will be your best friend I paw-mise.   I love to chase bunnies but not sure if I would chase kitties.  I am good with children but because I am a puppy I sometimes will hip or jump on people of all ages..  I need a 6' high fenced yard so I can get lots of exercise and a sister or brother to burn some energy.  \n\nOur dogs are not allowed to be left in a yard 24/7 unattended. They must live in the house with humans, not tied, chained, tethered or confined on a tie our of any sort.  We do not recommend an electronic underground fence system for shepherds.  Please go to www.faerielandrescue.org if you are serious about this puppy.  \n\n",

            "description": "\"She is a solo act.\" Runcie is a sweet, petite four and half-year-old Great Pyrenees mix. She is beautiful with her white coat and gorgeous dark markings on her face. Runcie weighs about 55 lbs and has a good appetite. She makes friends instantly with people.\n\nRuncie is house trained, not destructive, doesn't care to get on the couch, crate trained (although she likes sleeping near the front door), walks nicely on a leash, and enjoys daily walks. During the day, when not napping, Runcie is patrolling the fence line protecting the property. She is a good watchdog and not timid about new situations.\n\nRuncie will do well in a home with an all adult family with no kids, no cats, and no other dogs. She would be great as an only dog as she prefers your company and will need confident family leaders familiar with Pyr traits and behaviors. Please complete an Adoption Application if Runcie sounds like a perfect Pyr for you.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $175. Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Every GPRS dog is fully vetted (current on shots and has been spayed/neutered). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreeesrescuesociety.org .\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer! 2/2/21 5:51 PM",

I have tested positive for heartworms, so I will need some treatment, but don't let that worry you. The Houston SPCA teams with local VCA Animal Hospitals to cover most of my treatment. My adoption fee is only $95, so if you're looking for a lifetime of fun be sure to ask about me.\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Brown Weight: 36lbs Age: 1yrs 5mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

She loves to be petted and given treats.  Belly rubs and hugs are lots of fun for her as well.  Nugget could use some basic training classes to teach her manners and some basic commands.

A little timid at first, this pup will need a patient household with another confident pup to show him its okay. \n\nHe is a beagle mix so he is smaller than he looks in photos. He is very handsome and very eager to please. He loves learning new things if treats are involved. He may take some time to warm up, but once he does, you'll see the cutest beagle personality shine through. \n\nNoodles has done wonderful in his foster home and is now on the search for a forever home.

She's what we like to call a mini Great Dane (kidding, but sounds fancy!) she won over the hearts of her foster family and she's waiting to win over her furever family! Shed be a great addition to a lower energy household. She takes time learning to trust others and prefers dogs not to jump all over her. She will bark for attention and pets, and she will also bark when she doesn't like something so she has great communication skills! She's low energy and spends most her days curled up and sleeping, but between naps she enjoys eating everything. She takes some patience, love and time to warm up, but once she does she'll love you forever!",

A plan for you that's been written in the stars? Destiny comes in all forms but in this case, it's a bundle of sweet, playful, and cuddly soft puppy!\n\nDestiny is a young dog that is a little wary of new people on first meeting but soon realizes they give awesome ear scratches and take her on fun-filled adventures. This super wiggly girl loves to play with her doggy friends and has done well around children.\n\nShe would like a home with a patient family that will take her on adventures and then cuddles up with her at night.\n\nOh, did we mention her 2 colored eyes, just like David Bowie - one blue, one yellow, both beautiful! \n\nDestiny is waiting for you!",

            "description": "Hi there, Im Indiana Bones! Or you can call me Bones or any other name you think fits a fine dog like me. Ill love whatever name you give me, because it means Im your dog. Ah, that sounds so nice. Ive been through a lot in my short life, but through it all, I prevail! Im smart and energetic and tons of fun. I approach everything in life with enthusiasm and excitement. And while I prefer a quiet, calm, low traffic home with just a few special people, once I settle in with you, I will make a truly wonderful companion.\nIm a handsome, 2-year-old, 54-pound sweetheart with a happy, exuberant personality. And Im already housebroken too, although please be patient with me when we get home, because Ive been living in a shelter for quite a long time and its difficult to keep up a routine here. I came to Wayside last summer as a stray via animal control. I felt so alone and overwhelmed at the shelter. I was adopted for a while, but things didnt work out for me there. Although my family loved me very much and the feeling was mutual, they had a busy, hectic household and I just didnt fit in well with that environment. Thats ok though, because Im back at the shelter now and ready to meet my perfect match. I hope thats you!\nDuring my time at Wayside, Ive been able to participate in lots of training classes. Ive worked so hard and Ive made excellent progress! Im one of the smartest dogs youll ever meet and I currently know cues for Sit, Stay, Down, Heel, Come, Place, and Mask. Ive learned all about loose leash walking. And I now understand how to greet people in an appropriate way with positive reinforcement. I love the focus and attention that comes along with my training and it gives me the chance to show off what a great dog I can be. My training partners describe me as incredibly intelligent, happy, fun, focused, and a quick learner. I do everything with gusto and Im eager to please. Id love to have a job to do. Please give me time to warm up and go at my own pace when we get home. If you gently praise and encourage me when Im a good boy and if you will provide me with consistency and patience, I will quickly learn what you expect from me. I want so much to make you happy!\nI love to stay active and busy. Im an excellent running partner and a proud member of the Wayside Runners Club. I stay focused and keep a nice pace. I get so excited and happy to see my Wayside friends and Im always ready to walk or cuddle or just hang out. I go all in with whatever activity Im involved with, including playtime with my favorite toys. Im just a really nice friend to spend your day with. I need a home without kids or other animals. My Wayside friends are simply trying their best to set me up for a successful adoption and this sort of home will be best for me. Im looking for calm and quiet and a routine I can count on without the commotion that comes with a busy household. Im not the sort of dog who wants to go places and meet lots of new people. A calm homelife with you and daily exercise in a quiet area are all I want in life. Dog parks arent my thing, but a quiet hike in the woods with you sounds like heaven to me!\nI hope youre as committed and dedicated to me as I will be to you. You see, I plan to love you unconditionally with every ounce of my being, once we are family. Life can be hard when youve never had stability or a family that will always be there for you. Thats what I want. Thats what I dream of. I want you to be my person and I want to be your dog.\nLove, Indiana Bones\n ...",

Fit, fine and funny (he has the sweetest snore) at 59 pounds, he adores attention, loves cuddling with his foster mom on the couch, rubbing his body up against hers and covering her face in kisses while she pet, pet, pets him. He also loves the resident children and is learning not to jump up in his eagerness to be with them. Curious, enthusiastic and energetic, he enjoys exploring every nook and cranny of his foster home, playing on his own with sturdy toys that he can throw around, chewing on Icelandic Lamb horns, and frisking about with his doggy foster friends. As much as he loves car rides, he tries to sit in his foster mom's lap and while he endures being bathed, he does try to get out of the tub! Motivated by toys, food and attention, he likes all treats and accepts them gently, knows \"sit\" and \"off\", is working on \"stay\", and although he's not yet leash or crate trained, he's fully housetrained. Now all Snoopy needs is a home with extremely affectionate adopters to complete his training, polish his manners and keep him mentally stimulated and physically satisfied fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet, the next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives! A home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $300. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking here . We want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time. Our adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nDespite her name, 10-month-old Stormie is sweet and social, savoring life in her foster home and making it shine with her high spirits and constantly wagging tail. Happy, enthusiastic and energetic at a fit 45 pounds, she loves playing with her doggy foster friends of assorted ages and especially enjoys racing round the backyard and wrestling with the youngest one. She also loves stuffy toys and Nylabones, long walks and curious sniffs, walking best on a gentle lead as she hones her leash skills. Then, once she's burned off her excess energy, she enjoys chilling out with her foster mom, cuddling on her lap and nuzzling into her neck. Almost crate and housetrained, she's at work on her puppy manners and will thrive in a loving home with adopters to complete her training, educate her fully and keep her mentally and physically satisfied fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet, the next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives! A home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $345. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking here . We want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time. Our adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

She has little to no reaction to the doorbell or outdoor noises.\u00a0 She's timid by nature but has no problem opening up quickly.\u00a0 She's curious about cats but not aggressive.\u00a0 Our cat was unsure and scared of her at first but is now used to her, so we like to say she's cat friendly on a cat-by-cat basis as long as they're introduced slowly.\u00a0 Juliette gets along well with other dogs, but is mostly interested in being with her person.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf Juliette is the right girl for you please apply here:\u00a0https://www.surryanimalrescue.org/info/adoption",

I also love to play, receive rubs, and hear I'm a good girl (because I am)! I may be hesitant at first to meet some of the other dogs here at the shelter, but I am friendly when I do.

            "description": "Max / Male / 5 Years / 14 lbs / Yorkie Mix / Maple, ON\n\nMeet Max! Max was surrendered by his family when they could no longer care for him. Prior to being in foster care, Max had never known the comforts of being inside a home. He wants to be loved and is coming out of his shell every day in foster care. He will spin in a circle when he\u2019s sees his people or gets to go outside for a walk! He loves to play with his toys and has become a master at fetch. His fosters describe him as a snuggly and affectionate velcro dog. They also say he has a huge personality and a face that will capture anyones heart. Max would do best with a patient and understanding family who is committed to helping him reach his full potential!\n\nOnce people have earned his trust - Max is truly a friend for life. He is the first to greet his family at the door and its all tail wags and kisses. With strangers, his space must be resected until he is comfortable. Generally if people try and enter his space before he is ready, or enter the home with high/unbalanced energy, he will growl or lunge. His trusted humans must be advocates for his space and instruct people to ignore him upon entering the home. If he is awarded the opportunity to come around on his own, he responds positively and will engage with them quickly. The high energy and unpredictable movements of children have made him uncomfortable, so he would likely prefer a child-free home.\n\nMax has bonded closely with his foster family and isn\u2019t a fan of when they leave. He may sit by the door and try and \u201cblock\u201d it to encourage whoever is leaving to take him on the adventure. However, when he is left alone he will just sit and wait for their return. He is well mannered and has never clawed, whined or attempted to destroy anything. He is generally quiet in the home but does have a tendency to alert bark when someone knocks at the door.\n\nMax is going for 3,15 minute walks a day around his neighbourhood, and could go more if the weather was nicer. If given adequate opportunities to use the washroom, he is fully potty trained. On leash he is generally well behaved and will walk beside his human. He can be startled by noises outside and may freeze to take in his surroundings. When he sees others dogs he may bark or lunge as a fear response to their presence. His fosters are currently working on desensitization to triggers by always having high value treats on hand. He has done well so far but this will need to continue in forever home!\n\nMax is very smart and he figures out puzzles and games very quickly. He can learn a lot of tricks but you need to find the right treat that motivates him! He has already learned sit, twirl, come on the sofa, leave it, drop it, place, focus and wait. He has excellent impulse control. To continue building his confidence, Max will benefit from adopters committed to ongoing obedience and trick training. Max is sensitive to people touching his paws or being picked up, but is slowly getting used to it in the company of poeple he trusts.\n\nMax\u2019s ideal home would be in a detached home, with a fully fenced back yard. He loves to have the space to run and play. He doesn\u2019t do well with stairs or hardwood so would prefer bungalows with a lot of carpeting in the home. He would do best outside of the city, and would thrive in quiet country or suburban life. He would love an active family who is looking for a hiking or walking companion. Max doesn\u2019t like the company of other dogs or cats, so is looking to be the only pet in the home.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Max please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nMax\u2019s adoption fee is $750.

            "special_needs_notes": "Max / Male / 5 Years / 14 lbs / Yorkie Mix / Maple, ON\n\nMeet Max! Max was surrendered by his family when they could no longer care for him. Prior to being in foster care, Max had never known the comforts of being inside a home. He wants to be loved and is coming out of his shell every day in foster care. He will spin in a circle when he\u2019s sees his people or gets to go outside for a walk! He loves to play with his toys and has become a master at fetch. His fosters describe him as a snuggly and affectionate velcro dog. They also say he has a huge personality and a face that will capture anyones heart. Max would do best with a patient and understanding family who is committed to helping him reach his full potential!\n\nOnce people have earned his trust - Max is truly a friend for life. He is the first to greet his family at the door and its all tail wags and kisses. With strangers, his space must be resecued until he is comfortable. Generally if people try and enter his space before he is ready, or enter the home with high/unbalanced energy, he will growl or lunge. His trusted humans must be advocates for his space and instruct people to ignore him upon entering the home. If he is awarded the opportunity to come around on his own, he responds positively and will engage with them quickly. The high energy and unpredictable movements of children have made him uncomfortable, so he would likely prefer a child-free home.\n\nMax has bonded closely with his foster family and isn\u2019t a fan of when they leave. He may sit by the door and try and \u201cblock\u201d it to encourage whoever is leaving to take him on the adventure. However, when he is left alone he will just sit and wait for their return. He is well mannered and has never clawed, whined or attempted to destroy anything. He is generally quiet in the home but does have a tendency to alert bark when someone knocks at the door.\n\nMax is going for 3,15 minute walks a day around his neighbourhood, and could go more if the weather was nicer. If given adequate opportunities to use the washroom, he is fully potty trained. On leash he is generally well behaved and will walk beside his human. He can be startled by noises outside and may freeze to take in his surroundings. When he sees others dogs he may bark or lunge as a fear response to their presence. His fosters are currently working on desensitization to triggers by always having high value treats on hand. He has done well so far but this will need to continue in forever home!\n\nMax is very smart and he figures out puzzles and games very quickly. He can learn a lot of tricks but you need to find the right treat that motivates him! He has already learned sit, twirl, come on the sofa, leave it, drop it, place, focus and wait. He has excellent impulse control. To continue building his confidence, Max will benefit from adopters committed to ongoing obedience and trick training. Max is sensitive to people touching his paws or being picked up, but is slowly getting used to it in the company of people he trusts.\n\nMax\u2019s ideal home would be in a detached home, with a fully fenced back yard. He loves to have the space to run and play. He doesn\u2019t do well with stairs or hardwood so would prefer bungalows with a lot of carpeting in the home. He would do best outside of the city, and would thrive in quiet country or suburban life. He would love an active family who is looking for a hiking or walking companion. Max doesn\u2019t like the company of other dogs or cats, so is looking to be the only pet in the home.\n\n**Max has a progressive form of IVDD (intervertebral disc disease) . He is doing well and his symptoms are being managed while in foster care. Surgery may be required down the line and continued management will be a part of his ongoing care. Any potential adopters will have the opportunity to speak to our vet team for more details on his care.**\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Max please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nMax\u2019s adoption fee is $750.

Because Allie has so much energy, she would love to have her own fenced in yard and have another playful furry friend who is her size to help release her energy. She would make a good walking/running partner. Allie's new home should be cat free and have no young children.\n\nAllie is ten months old and weighs 32 pounds.\n\nAllie's adoption fee is $200; she is microchipped, spayed, and up to date on vaccines. Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.",

After his 7 day hold, he was tested and it was determined that he was heartworm positive.\n\nHe has gone through the treatment for heartworms and survived.\n\nThe adoption fee for Jonnah is $125. This includes spay/neuter, rabies, distemper, bordatella, flea treatment, worming, testing for heartworms and treatment, and microchiping.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Jonnah, please visit the shelter at 22407 Bus Hwy 151 on the outskirts of Monticello during normal business hours which are Tuesday thru Saturday, noon to 6:30pm. If you have any further questions, you can call 319-975-8283.\n\nBREED DISCLAIMER: Many dogs come to us as strays and therefore, we are unsure of their breed. We may actually list a pure bred as a mix because we truly do not know their origins or background and we often must guess at their breed.",

            "description": "Teddy #7601 is a handsome 1-year-old male, Husky/Shepherd mix. Teddy is very friendly, affectionate, gentle and active. He is house trained. He knows the sit command. This active boy needs daily dedicated exercise and mental stimulation. A very tall fenced- in yard would be great; he is athletic and is a high jumper.  He seems to do well meeting other similarly sized dogs on walks. He enjoys long walks and is good on leash unless he gets into close proximity to something interesting, like a squirrel, then he pulls; we are working with him on this. He should NOT be in a home with cats.  He likes to be with his person and would do well with someone who is home a lot. As he tends to worry if he isn\u2019t with his person, he should be crated when he is alone, at least initially. He rides well in the car.  He weighs 52 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours.

I was found wondering around a gas station stealing snacks, which apparently is frowned upon..but i LOVE snacks!!  Because of my sneaky snack stealing past, my hooman friends here want me to find a home with a fenced in yard to make sure I don't go looking for more gas stations snacks.  I really LOVE all people I have met so far, no one is a stranger to me!! The peoples here say I am a very happy go lucky girl and I love getting pets and hanging out with the peoples.  I would love to find a friend or a family that could help me do some exercise or maybe even learn some tricks because I am a smart girl and my breed can be high energy!  Please come by and meet me so we can become best friends and eat snacks together!!",

All very well rounded and great with dogs and children. Kennedy's mother is a medium sized dog, maybe 40 lbs and appears to be a hound/pit mix. He is crate training in his foster home and doing well. Kennedy will do best in a home with a young social dog and a fenced yard for playtime is a must. Applications online at ruffredemption.org.\nVisit ruffredemption.org to complete an application. All Ruff Redemption Dogs are spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. They also receive a minimum of two distemper/parvo vaccines, medication for the treatment and prevention of intestinal worms, and monthly heart worm/flea prevention while in our care. Rabies vaccines are given if the dog is 16 weeks of age or older.",

Let's hop right to it!\nAbout Boomer\nAge: 1-2 years\nSex: Male\nBreed: Boxer Mix\nIf this boys pouty lip doesn't draw you in.. I don't know what will. He is in the market for a patient home that will be eager to teach him the basics and provide some training. He is very excitable here at the shelter and enjoys nothing more than any attention that is given to him!! His other favorite likes are toys, pupsicles and soft blankets!!\nBoomer is overly excited when meeting new dogs and therefore proper meet and greets will be required. He does calm down once the initial excitement is over!!\nHe was the same way when introduced to cats.\nBoomer would do best and thrive in a home that is active and likes to play. He loves his one on one time but will need someone that has the patience to train! He is eager to please and just knows there is a family out there to call his very own!!!\nPlease call 804-520-9397 to schedule a time to meet Boomer!\n- Please follow us on Facebook under Colonial Heights Animal Services-",

He *will not* be fit for an apartment* This boy needs room to run (fenced in yard) or an *ACTIVE* owner dedicated to leash walking. Honcho knows basic commands but what he may not know sometimes is his size! He has legs for days and will use them full force for zoomies or for jumping up (we are working on that).\n\nThis hunk is treat and praise motivated and has also done well with his dog test. Although proper meet and greets will be required. Honcho forgets how large he is and can be pushy with other dogs.\nHe loves to play (toys, balls, chewies.. etc)\nHoncho has been cat tested and is curious but mainly fearful.\nHe would do best in a home with older children (8 and over).\n\nThis boy is fabulous and we are looking for an equally fabulous home. If you think he would be a good fit and you Match his needs, please give us a call 804-520-9397.",

It's almost a New Year and what could be better than kicking it off with unconditional Love?\n\nThis boy is 1.5 years young, neutered, microchipped, playful and ready for a HOME to call his very own!\nCopper DOES get along with other dogs but will require a proper meet and greet. He can sometimes be overbearing with his toys with other dogs. Of course... he loves his lady companions the most!\nCopper is great with the basics but of course will need a refresher. We are hoping to place him in a home that has room to run!\nHe has those long legs that just beg to stretch out and will require running and playtime. Fenced in yard is recommended. Please *no apartments*\n\nCopper is pending his cat test. He does well with children but keep in mind he is rather large and can forget his size!!\n\nFor more information on Copper, please CALL Colonial Heights Animal Services at 804-520-9397.\n--PLEASE ALSO FOLLOW US ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE UNDER COLONIAL HEIGHTS ANIMAL SERVICES--",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Daisy is sweet and lovable and just LOVES attention. She does exhibit anxiety when left alone. Currently, she is in a foster home and is making sure to keep her foster dad in sight. We expect that Daisy will build her confidence in her foster home so that her anxiety will lessen. She likes to be with her human. Daisy prefers to sleep in her own bed on the floor (or with her human if allowed) but does NOT handle being crated. In her past, she has harmed herself in the crate.\n\nShe doesn't bother the resident cat--she is even submissive to her--until the cat hits the ground running. :) Daisy likes to give chase but not with intent to do harm.\n\nDaisy is quiet once she is acclimated to the surroundings. She has whined/wimpered on her first day at her foster home but has settled down nicely. Daisy came from a house with children who she loved and who loved her.\n\nWe believe Daisy will thrive with another dog in the home.\n\nShe is currently not 100% housetrained but is being supported in her foster home--has had NO accidents during the night. In addition she is learning leash manners, but for now, we would recommend a fenced area. We will continue to update this profile as we learn more about Miss Daisy.",

If you have any further questions, you can call 319-975-8283.\n\nBREED DISCLAIMER: Many dogs come to us as strays and therefore, we are unsure of their breed.

He has since been treated and is now looking for a home to live out the rest of his life.\n\nThe adoption fee for Watson is $125. This includes spay/neuter, rabies, distemper, bordatella, flea treatment, worming, testing for heartworms and treatment, and microchiping.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Watson, please visit the shelter at 22407 Bus Hwy 151 on the outskirts of Monticello during normal business hours which are Tuesday thru Saturday, noon to 6:30pm. If you have any further questions, you can call 319-975-8283.\n\nBREED DISCLAIMER: Many dogs come to us as strays and therefore, we are unsure of their breed. We may actually list a pure bred as a mix because we truly do not know their origins or background and we often must guess at their breed.",

I am shy and timid around new strangers but I mean them no harm. I have never growled or shown my teeth, it just takes me a little longer to warm up to people. \n\nI don't like crates!!! I WILL destroy it to get out of it so my mom put me in training but I was only in it for about four weeks and had just started to make progress when they decided they just didn't have enough time and patience for a learning, growing puppy.  So here I am, looking for someone that has lots of love, patience and time to give me so I can be the bestest pupper I can be!!! I still can't be crated though, we will need to work on that. \n\nI have been around other dogs and seem to do okay. I don't really have much interest in them but they don't bother me. I have never been around cats but was in a home with older (11+ year) RESPECTFUL children! I love to lick kiddos faces!!! *SLURP* \n\nIf you think you have the perfect home for me, please visit our website to submit an adoption application; www.whiteriverhumanesociety.org!!",

My siblings and I were diagnosed with Parvo, but have since been cleared by our vet and are ready for adoption. I am an American Staffordshire Terrier mix, who is the smallest of my litter. I enjoy playing with my siblings and the resident dogs in my foster home. I am inquisitive and like to explore all the things. I currently am working on sit, and stay as well as potty training. On most occasions I can hold it through the entire night, and have only had an accident once this week. Foster mom and I are very proud of me. I am growing fast and we expect that I will be about 50 lbs once fully grown. So only older considerate kids for me, as I wouldn't want to accidently hurt anyone. My adoption fee is $550. Includes Travel fee, Health Certificate, vaccines, spay and microchip. Fill out an at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptable tab. If my foster family and I think you are my forever home, I'll get to be all yours on March 20th.",

My siblings and I were diagnosed with Parvo, but have since been cleared by our vet and are ready for adoption. I am an American Staffordshire Terrier mix, who is the quietest of my litter, however, I will let you know when I am hungry, need to potty, or want to play. I also enjoy playing with my siblings and the resident dogs in my foster home. I am inquisitive and like to explore all the things. I currently am working on sit, and stay as well as potty training. On most occasions I can hold it through the entire night, and have only had an accident once this week. Foster mom and I are very proud of me. I am growing fast and we expect that I will be about 60+ lbs once fully grown. So only older considerate kids for me, as I wouldn't want to accidently hurt anyone. My adoption fee is $550. Includes Travel fee, Health Certificate, vaccines, spay and microchip. Fill out an at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptable tab. If my foster family and I think you are my forever home, I'll get to be all yours on March 20th.",

She'll also be happy to curl up with you at the end of the day, when she's all played out. She'll love obedience school so she can learn to be the best girl she can be.\n\nWhat My Foster Says About Me:\nLilly is a spitfire and has a huge personality! Lilly loves to PLAY-- chasing and being chased is her absolute favorite. She's a huge clown and constantly makes me laugh, including when she's chasing her own tail and barking at herself in the mirror. Lilly is also an incredibly precocious, curious dog. She's always exploring her surroundings, you can practically see the wheels turning in her brain as she figures things out and experiences new things.\n\nWhen she's done running out her energy at the park or on a long walk, Lilly is a little couch potato who likes to lounge and snuggle and wants to be close to her people.\n\nHer other favorite hobby is watching birds outside and \"protecting\" us from them-- she's a very diligent \"guard dog\"! Lilly would love to go to a home with someone who is ready to help her channel her energy into long hikes or trips to the dog park, and to support her to learn basic obedience skills so that she can be the best dog she can be. She's a smart, spunky girl with lots of love to give!\n\nSpecial Adoption Considerations: Lilly is a rambunctious teenager with lots of energy! Lilly gets anxious with strangers in the house so needs training to help her feel more secure. Because she can be anxious, she needs to go to a home with no kids under the age of 12.\n\nMore about Lilly: https://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/javascript/v2.0/template1?animalID=15666109&key=Mqr6gy1W\n\nContact: info@luckydoganimalrescue.org",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nChoco is an active energetic guy who would benefit from basic manners training.  He walks nicely on leash and loves to go for walks. He is friendly and loves to play.  He is a young adult but has plenty of puppy attitude left.  \n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

She's probably going to stay small to maybe medium size. She has a super unique genetic makeup as she is short legged and long bodied but thick in the middle! \n\nJellyBean is super smart and eager to learn. She loves toys and treats and being a puppy! She's still mastering potty training, but she is a smart girl and will hopefully fully learn pretty quickly. She loves every dog she meets and would thrive if she had a fur-friend in her furever home. She also has met and loved some human kids and would likely enjoy having a non fursibling as well :) ! When it's time to calm down, she is happy to snuggle hard with her human and furry friends. \n\nJellyBean is spayed, up to date on vaccines and heartworm prevention, and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting JellyBean, please fill out the application at www.texassweetiesdogrescue.org. Her adoption fee is $250. \n",

Dangit, I\u2019m ready for my forever home. After living in the shelter and in a foster home forever, I declare that it\u2019s high time for me to curl up on my forever couch and chew on some of those tasty forever bones and toys. \n\nI\u2019ve come a heck of a long way from my shelter days. My foster mom\u2019s been showing me all kinds of house dog stuff and I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m not only house trained, but I\u2019ve got great inside manners. I don\u2019t crate all that well but friend, you don\u2019t even really need to crate me; I mostly like to curl up and sleep while you\u2019re gone.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve gotta be honest- if you try and man handle me, I will be growly and grumpy (so please don\u2019t pull me off your couch). However, if you got a treat and some kind words, I\u2019ll do just about anything for you; all this simple hound needs is a little kindness and some bribery.\n\nAfter living in a great foster home with fenced yards and other dogs, I\u2019m confident that I\u2019d do best in a home with a fenced yard and another dog. My favorite things in the world are car rides and playing with other dogs. So if you\u2019re looking for a copilot to keep that passenger seat toasty, buddy, you\u2019re looking at me!\n\nHowdy chums, it\u2019s me, your friendly neighborhood Laith!

We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries. For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.org",

He's still getting used to walking on a leash, but he's growing more confident every day.  He would prefer to be in a home with another dog. He needs a home with a yard. He weighs approx 30 lbs.\n\nDue to Covid 19 many veterinarians have had to postpone spay/neuter procedures, therefore he has not yet been neutered. Adopters will be required to sign a spay/neuter agreement upon adoption, whereby they can to take him to our vet to be neutered at no cost.",

She desperately wants love and will slowly trust you. She doesn't have a mean bone in her body, and can't wait to find out what it's like to live a spoiled life as a cherished family member. \nShe will come fixed, chipped,vaccinated, and heartworm tested negative.\n\n***If you are serious about adopting, you must first complete and submit an application on our website.

Northwoods takes dogs from a shelter where these dogs would otherwise be euthanized. They now will have a second chance here in Minnesota.\n\nRen is an adorable little wiggle worm!  Very friendly and sweet, will just need some puppy training but we think he'll do great at that!\n\nGood With Kids: Unknown\nGood With Cats: Unknown\nGood With Dogs:  Unknown\nWe do require a meet-and-greet with your dog(s) onsite prior to any dog adoptions here at Northwoods.\n\nAll the dogs at Northwoods Humane Society have had a basic exam by a tech. They have been microchipped, tested for Heartworm (if over 6 months of age), had at least their first distemper combo vaccination (2nd if here longer), dewormed with a general dewormer, and had a flea and tick treatment applied if applicable. All the dogs will be spayed or neutered before they are adopted to their new permanent homes. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.",

She slept a good 9 hours before getting up and pawing at the door to be taken outside.\n\nShe was an excited car rider, but not anxious - liked getting into and out of the truck.\n\nShe is friendly with new people.  \n\nEmail adoption@wilco.org to meet her.",

Handsome and happy, Rigby is always ready for his next adventure. He\u2019s definitely a ladies\u2019 man, as he does well meeting and mingling with female dogs. When he\u2019s not trying to impress the ladies, he\u2019s waiting for his walks so he can get out there and sniff to his heart\u2019s delight! He\u2019s a curious boy who just needs a little time to adjust and fully come into his own. His mid-energy level and medium size make him an ideal adventure buddy, who will begin to follow you around for attention. We think he is likely housebroken. Rigby is ready for his forever home and maybe it\u2019s with you!\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "Location: Arlington, VAHi! I'm Annabelle, and there's nothing I love more in the world than giving kisses to my favorite humans! One piece of cheese (call it a bribe if you want) and I will consider us BEST FRIENDS.\n\nHere are a few things I like a lot:\n- naps\n- chilling on the couch\n- soft toys\n- tug of war\n- squirrels\n- hiking\n- snacks\n\nI'm super low-maintenance at home. Got work to do? Cool, I'll just squeeze in a quick nap! Wanna chill on the couch with me? That's perfect! Got a treat to share? Check out my skills -- I can sit, lie down, and give you my paw to earn it. I don't mind my crate and I sleep quietly all night.\n\nDo you like to hike? I'd love to be your hiking buddy! My foster mom took me on a long hike and I spent all 7 miles grinning from ear to ear. I also love walks around the neighborhood!\n\nI can't wait to find my forever home! I'd like to end up in a single family house so there are limited scary noises around!\n\nWhat My Foster Says About Me: Annabelle is a very sweet dog! She is housetrained and loves car rides. She has not damaged anything since living with her foster family. Annabelle still sleeps in the crate and spends some time during the day there too.\n\nAnnabelle is very low-key at home and loves snuggles, giving kisses, and getting all the attention! She is super gentle with her human foster siblings and immediately bonded with her human foster brother when he came home from college. At home, Annabelle often approaches members of her foster family with her rope to play tug of war. She does try to take any opportunity to get on the couch or bed but who doesn't like being cozy?\n\nAnnabelle is very smart and trainable - she knows how to sit, give you a paw, lay down and will do everything at once for a treat! She loves to play with different little blankets or other pieces of fabric! She also loves to chase balls, play tug of war with ropes and she loves to run. She gets 1-2 daily walks and does well on the leash - her foster dad will often jog with her because she loves to run next to him - if someone is looking for a dog as a running partner, Annabelle would be good for that. She also loves hiking!\n\nAnnabelle can be a bit unsettled by strangers in the home, but with a slow and proper introduction she will be a visitor's best friend in no time! Because she can be a little shy and has exhibited resources guarding tendencies, we would like Annabelle to be the only dog in her home.\n\nAnnabelle is a very sweet girl who LOVES her humans and will thrive in a home with an experienced dog owner who is dedicated to helping her be the best pup she can be!\n\nLucky Dog cannot guarantee any dog is housebroken. All of our dogs are working on their crate training.\n\nLearn more about Annabelle: https://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/javascript/v2.0/template1?animalID=15947613&key=Mqr6gy1W\n\nContact: info@luckydoganimalrescue.org",

He is now super ready for adoption to his forever home!\n\nRaja gets along with everyone. He has lived with big and small dogs, cats, children, and adults, and his gentle demeanor never changes. As his foster home says, \u201cHe is completely house trained and is one of the most well-mannered dogs possible. We have yet to hear him bark and he seems to know exactly what you want at all times.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nRaja loves being outside, so a fenced yard would be helpful. Age has stiffened his movements, so long term, limited to no stairs is very helpful. He is on medications to help his mobility, and those medications must continue. \n\nA beautiful hound mix, Raja thrives with a comfortable spot to rest his head, a chance to lay quietly in the sun, and the companionship of humans who love him. He will give back tenfold on the love, guaranteed!\n\nIs this you? Please fill out an adoption application and we will be glad to answer any questions! WE WILL ONLY ANSWER QUESTIONS ONCE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION IS FILED ON OUR WEBSITE, topdogfoundation.org. Thank you for respecting this.",

She\u2019s very energetic and loves spending time outdoors, but she loves to cuddle at night after a long day of running around. She\u2019s a little nervous around other dogs, but with a proper introduction, she does just fine! Kiki is full grown at 53 lbs. She would do best in a home with older children as she\u2019s still a little timid. She\u2019s house broken and working on kennel training. Kiki is heartworm negative, up to date to vaccines and scheduled to be spayed on February 17. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

Northwoods takes dogs from a shelter where these dogs would otherwise be euthanized. They now will have a second chance here in Minnesota.\n\nI am a little shy, but friendly. I haven't been in Minnesota for very long so once I get comfortable, I will come out of my shell. \n\nGood With Kids: Unknown\nGood With Cats:  Unknown\nGood With Dogs: He came to MN with his 'brother' and has done well with the dogs in shelter. \nWe do require a meet-and-greet with your dog(s) onsite prior to any dog adoptions here at Northwoods.\n\nAll the dogs at Northwoods Humane Society have had a basic exam by a tech. They have been microchipped, tested for Heartworm (if over 6 months of age), had at least their first distemper combo vaccination (2nd if here longer), dewormed with a general dewormer, and had a flea and tick treatment applied if applicable. All the dogs will be spayed or neutered before they are adopted to their new permanent homes. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.",

            "description": "Meet Bella! \n\nBella has bounced around a few homes over the last year and would really like to find her true furrever home. She is a large, strong girl. She does well with other dogs although she prefers to be the dominant one. She doesn't mind cats. Bella can be toy possessive & protective of her owners to some people when in her own home. Ideally if uncomfortable around others she would be happy to have a home that knows they may need to keep her in a kennel when company is over. While Bella loves kids, due to her being toy possessive, she would do better in a home with older kids that won't try to take a toy from her without parental supervision. She is incredibly playful and loves to go for walks and be around her people. Sometimes it takes a little time for her to get comfortable around new people so during her meet and greet she likes to take things slow and smell you out to make sure you're safe. If you think you'd be interested in her please give us a call to schedule a meet and greet. 423-581-1494.

            "description": "GOOD with dogs, GOOD with kids, GOOD with cats\n\nADOPTION FEE: $400 www.unbreakabull.com/adopt\n\nHi everyone!!!! My name is Rex, and I am 1 year old and just the goofiest thing ever! I came to the shelter when my previous owner passed away and there was no one to take care of me. I came very scared and shy of everything, but since coming to rescue and getting settled, I am doing so much better and am starting to let my personality shine. While I am one year old, I am still learning so many things. My foster mom says that I am so sweet and so respectful. I am also learning to play with my foster fur brother and that is fun. I really like dogs, and I hope to have a playmate in my forever home, but I would also be quite content being the sole dog. I am working on confidence building as well. There are things that will startle me, like tennis balls, but that\u2019s just because they are new items to me. Once I discover that they aren\u2019t scary, I am totally okay with them. I am curious of the cat that lives here, but I am super good when redirected to leave it alone. We are learning to co-exist in the same space. I am also learning to be good in my kennel. I do okay for the most part, but I am working on it. I only bark when I have to go outside to go potty, so I pretty much have the hang of that. All that I am looking for in life is someone who can teach me the ropes of being a model fur-citizen, give me tons of love and attention, and the comfiest place to sleep. If you think that you are ready to be my person forever, please fill out my application, and let\u2019s make this adventure final! Until then, I\u2019m going to do some more investigating of this tennis ball thing and see what the hype is all about when it comes to it and my fur-foster brother. Until we meet, Rex (UPDATED 01/21/21)",

Northwoods takes dogs from a shelter where these dogs would otherwise be euthanized. They now will have a second chance here in Minnesota.\n\nI am a very friendly boy! I love to play and am very people oriented. I would thrive in dog obedience training. I am a very smart boy!\n\nGood With Kids:  unknown but likely\nGood With Cats:  unknown but likely\nGood With Dogs:  unknown but likely\nWe do require a meet-and-greet with your dog(s) onsite prior to any dog adoptions here at Northwoods.\n\nAll the dogs at Northwoods Humane Society have had a basic exam by a tech. They have been microchipped, tested for Heartworm (if over 6 months of age), had at least their first distemper combo vaccination (2nd if here longer), dewormed with a general dewormer, and had a flea and tick treatment applied if applicable. All the dogs will be spayed or neutered before they are adopted to their new permanent homes. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.",

I haven't been with MaxFund for very long, but I'm ready to explore the world! I love humans, and am always on my best behavior with them.\n But I don't do so great with other dogs. We are working on proper introductions with other dogs, but it will be a slow process. For now, I would do best in a household with no other dogs. \n\nAre you ready to be my adventure time companion? Call MaxFund at 303-595-4917 to set up an appointment for me to meet you!\n\nMaxFund is a physical shelter located at 1005 Galapago St in Denver, Colorado.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a dog, please call 303-595-4917 to make an appointment to meet a dog.\n.\nThis PetFinder account is managed by volunteers, and the most up-to-date information is at the shelter.\nHow our adoption process works:\n1. You MUST come into the shelter to meet a dog you are interested in (and meet a few others, while you\u2019re at it!)\n                 Our hours are 10-5 Mon, Wed, Thu Fri / 11-5 Saturday / 12-5 Sunday\n                We suggest you call ahead to be sure the dog(s) do not have pending applications\n2. You will fill out your adoption application, including references, after finding a dog you\u2019d like to adopt\n3. The application review and reference checks will take up to 3-5 business days; you will not be able to bring a dog home same-day\n                We only take 2 applications per dog, before they are unavailable. This is why we suggest you call ahead to check the status of the pup!\n \nWe do not adopt out-of-state.\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

She's wiggly and playful with her human friends and loves to climb in their lap and give kisses. She'll be a very loyal best friend and her medium size makes her perfect for taking on adventures.\nCHECK OUT HER VIDEO ON YOUTUBE https://youtu.be/ONUMPfioeRI",

She lives for a good belly rub. Pics just don't do her justice! Gen is great on a leash, affectionate as can be, and listens well. She sat outside with us at a restaurant and was perfectly behaved and super friendly to anyone who showed interest in her. She did well around other dogs and was easy and relaxed while still having good energy. For anyone interested in a new pet, Genevieve is such a great catch!\n\nGenevieve was found in a parking lot under a car. The woman who found her took her to get scanned for a chip and she did not have one. She is sweet and healthy. We think she would make a great family pet. She has a super sweet disposition.",

            "description": "Bonnie has a very loving personality. She is smart, intuitive, playful and a little silly at times. She is fully housebroken and knows how to sit, lay down, and roll over. While she doesn't like going in the crate, she will remain calm once inside. Bonnie's foster mom reports that she is very respectful of household properties such as beds, couches and even trash; she won't touch it unless you give her permission. Bonnie is very excited to meet new people and is working on learning not to jump on them. When she wants attention that she's not getting, she will come up to you and put her toes on yours, and nudge your knees with her nose as if to say \"come on, you know you want to play\". If you don't have time (or don't want to play), Bonnie will leave you alone if you ignore her. Bonnie can be a bit picky about food; she prefers her dry food to be completely mixed with the wet food. Otherwise, she won't eat. Bonnie's favorite activities are going on walks and playing catch & tug of war, people watching and sleeping. Her least favorite thing in the world is a cat. If you are interested in meeting sweet Bonnie, you can submit an appointment request here: \n\nhttps://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lsJ_8Hpq8k2OaDbCdJiGnZ0KUdNlMOxGs9o3MWhive1UOFRNUUhQMlFUSlM4UU04RUdEQ1dQNUFWTC4u\n\nCurrent weight: 70 pounds\nCurrent age: 2 years old",

Along with him, his lady Snow White and their seven puppies were confiscated from a very bad situation and brought to us for rescue. \n\nPuppies are now weaned and vetted and all in their forever homes. Momma Snow White found her forever home and is living her best life, that just leaves Prince Charming left to find his happy ending! \n\nPrince is filly vetted and neutered and ready to go home! Prince loves all people is a happy, silly, playful boy! He  loves his toys and does a good job not chewing them up. Cardboard on the other hand is villainous and will be destroyed by the brave Prince. \n\nPrince is a quiet dog and goes great in his kennel. He seems to be house broken and dog selective. He prefers female dogs and will require a meet and greet before adoption. Prince cannot be around cats! He does have a strong prey drive. \n\nWill you be Prince Charming\u2019s happy ever after!?",

Lucy is a lively, active girl who is house trained, and loves to ride in the car. She is completely devoted to her person, currently her foster mom.\n\nLucy is slow to accept new people and will snap at them if they persist in trying to make friends. She will come around, especially if treats are involved, but she needs to make friends on her own terms.\n\nLucy gets along with other dogs but would prefer to be an only dog so she gets all the attention. She is good with dog savvy cats. Lucy requires a home with no children and one that does not have many visitors. If you are interested in adopting Lucy, please go to our website to read the details:\nhttps://www.almosthomehdr.org/\n",

Her favorite thing in the world is to be with her people, and she loves all of the petting, lap time and snuggles she can get??. She also loves anything soft and can often be found rooting around in her blankets and bedding to make the perfect nest. \n\nLola currently lives in a foster home with 2 big dogs and can often be found snuggled up next to one of them for warmth if her people aren\u2019t available. She hasn\u2019t done as well with small dogs and cats, but bigger mellow dogs that don\u2019t challenge her have been fine. She has also done well with a toddler and would do fine with respectful children. \n\nLola is 12 years old and is still spunky and vibrant for a senior. She is pretty much house trained but does have the occasional accident. Due to the anatomy of her respiratory system she can sound snorty and congested, and is more prone to upper respiratory infections. Her future family will need to keep an eye on her and if she sounds extra congested or her discharge is not clear she will need to get in to see a vet and will likely need a course of antibiotics. \n\nWe are partnering with the Animal Welfare Society in Kennebunk Maine to find Lola some new digs. She is amazing and will make some very lucky adopter very happy!!!\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

            "description": "\"How yoose doing? I'm Hurb and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center from ACCT, so I'm an #ACCTtoPAC rescue! \n\nI'm around 9 years young, a solid 67 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nI'm a staff and volunteer favorite. Don't let my age fool you! I love going on walks and I have a playful disposition. The folks here describe me as affectionate, independent, fearless, quiet, and smart. I have been taking on the role of official office dog. My jobs include making sure the staff are providing me with plenty of attention and hugs. They were slacking on a comfy bed, so I let them know that was a must for important office dogs.\n\nIf you are looking for well mannered gentleman, then look no further! I am housebroken, incredibly sweet, and I will make sure to keep our days together are fun and interesting. I do need to disclose that some of elder ailments such as cataracts which impair my vision, but I am still able to see light and motion and I am deaf, but these things don't hold me back from living my best live with the right doggy roommate. With my sweet disposition, the staff also think I'd likely be a great roommate for kids of any age!\n\nOn a recent sleepover with one of PAC's loving foster moms, I was told to pass along that I'm \"a wonderful house guest, so gentle and loving.\" I'm totally enjoying hanging out with her and her dog pals in their warm, comfy home!\n\nThe staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! If you are interested in meeting me in person, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! XOXO-Hurb\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

            "description": "\"Hi, there!  Thank you for stopping by to read about me!  I'm Kristoff and I recently joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center's lifesaving facility.  \n\nI'm just over 1 year old and about 61 pounds.  I'm all set to join my new family - already neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  \n\nI spent some time with a foster family and they called me a \"lovebug\". I'm not 100% sure why they called me a bug because I'm a dog... but I think it means I am very affectionate and just want to make you smile. My foster family says I'm a good walker and I'm learning how to do all the grown up dog things like sit and go to the bathroom outside. If you have another dog in the house for me to play with, that would be SO much fun because I love to play with other dogs! \n\nThe staff think my ideal home would would have another doggy roommate. I love to play! No cats please. I'm a little too interested in them. If your family has children, the staff think that older children that are high school aged or older would be best. I can be rambunctious! \n\nI am lucky enough to be staying with one of PAC's fabulous foster partners, Perfect Pooch in King of Prussia, while I wait for my forever family to find me.  If you are interested in more information about me including my most up-to-date status and/or would like to set up a meeting with me, please contact the fabulous staff at Perfect Pooch today at 610-337-7698! We hope to hear from you soon! XOXO Kristoff\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.\n\nBe sure to read ALL information provided.\n\nA PET IS FOR LIFE -\nTHINK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT!\n\nJERRY was saved from a high kill shelter in Texas where dogs often have only 3 days to be saved. JERRY is neutered rabies, core vaccines, heartworm/tick disease tested negative for all. He is de-wormed, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of rescue in the middle of January 2021, he weighed around 50.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 3 November 2017\n\n. We cannot say for sure what breed he is, so we expect families to do their own research on his look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for his needs.\n\nWhen JERRY arrived at the rescue in Sebec, Maine on 15th January 2021 he was very shy and fearful. When in his kennel he would give a warning growl, letting me know he was unsure and uncomfortable at which I respected and left him alone for a while so that he could get settled. I found that when Jerry feels he is cornered he will let you know by growling and when I back off and get to his level he gets more relaxed and will come up to smell and get his ears scratched. When cleaning his kennel I would make sure he was inside before I cleaned outside as this is where he felt the most threatened and trapped. After a few days he and his kennel neighbour had gotten into each others kennel and were sharing the elevated dog bed and his demeanor instantly changed, him obviously gaining confidence through the happy-go-lucky Sophie.\n\nAfter a few days Sophie was adopted and Jerry had to get used to being in the kennel on his own, his affection for me was great, there was no more fear and he was becoming very attached. Jerry had a meet and great with a GSD experienced family, but when I took him out to meet them, he again became very fearful and only wanted to be near me. After a few minutes we decided that putting him back in the kennel and spending time with him through the gate might help, however, it just seemed to escalate his fear and his fearful growling, turned into barking and we both agreed that he was not ready for his new home yet - more so with the family having a small child and not being able to dedicate and commit to the training and work he will need.\n\nInstead of going back in a kennel, I put Jerry in with the remaining dogs that had been relocated to the communal area in the kennels where there is access to a large, secure fenced in area. At first very cautious and wary, which was to be expected as several younger dogs all wanting to jump on him, however, after a while he settled down, but lay at the gate waiting for me. After a few hours he did great and we all went outside and he got to explore the outside and the snow - he was very happy and loved being able to run and seemed settled now with the other dogs. I did, however, end up moving him again to a kennel over in the shop area, as I didn't feel comfortable leaving him unsupervised with the other younger dogs jumping on him all the time. If we don't find him a forever home soon, I do intend to bring him up to the house where he will be with many other dogs, but older and not wanting to jump on him.\n\nJerry is a very sweet, affectionate boy who has clearly had something happen to him where he has lost trust, it could be something as simple as his family dumping him in a shelter, shepherds get very attached to their people and it shatters their hearts when they dump them. He might have been caught as a stray and a catch pole or something used that scared him, or we could assume many other scenarios, but the truth is we do not know. We just want to find the absolute perfect family to give this boy what he needs to build and gain trust and be the happy, confident boy that he should be.\n\nWe are looking for a family that is active for sure, someone that understands the need of not just physical exercise but training and lifetime mental stimulation. He is going to need a family that is able to give him space where he can decompress and learn to trust his family and understands that this can take time.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nWe do not know how Jerry is with cats or livestock, but expect families to be prepared to work through any potential issues and ensure a safe and happy living environment for all.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nJERRY is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing. Animal Welfare is deemed essential in the US, but quarantine rules entering back into Canada must be followed.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 1-2 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend.\n\nClick here to watch a video of JERRY.",

She loves to just run and run. She's housebroken and crate trained. She does well on a leash but, is a little skittish. \n\nSydney really enjoys playing with other dogs. In her past home she's gotten possessive over her person and her toys and this was why she was surrendered. She is currently in a foster home with a large, submissive male dog and has had no issues.\n\nBecause Syd is so shy we are asking kids be 12 and up.\n\nSydney is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention.\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\n***We require a complete and approved application before setting up a meet n greet.***\n\nTo apply to adopt just copy and paste the link into your search bar!\nhttps://fs24.formsite.com/oneatatimek9rescue/form1/index.html",

He is a beautiful Red and Rust color.  King gets along great with other dogs and adores children.  He loves to play and loves his toys, he is a big baby.  We have not cat tested him.  King is very energetic and needs a fenced in yard to run and play in.  King would  benefit greatly from obedience training.   \n\nKing is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, heartworm NEGATIVE, and dewormed.  His adoption fee is $500.00.  \n\nPlease call For Paws Rescue at 678-592-0064 for further information on King and our adoption process.",

She knows a handful of basic cues, loves hanging out curled up in the doggie bed with her favorite stuffy and on occasion, she\u2019ll even engage in a game of fetch. Her favorite thing to do is sniff sniff sniff!\n\nWillow is a behavioral special needs dog as she is very protective of her toys and food. We recently learned she may have a food allergy and has had multiple ear infections, so she has a sensitivity to things around her head including a collar and harness. Once the relationship and trust is built Willow is very attached to her person and will always be right by your side.\n\nWillow needs a patient, devoted person who will earn his trust, and respect his boundaries.\n\nAnimal Aid will provide free sessions with Willow\u2019s certified professional trainer to help that special person learn how to help this special dog.\n\nPotential adopter must have a securely fenced yard, and live in an adult-only household.\n\nIf interested in meeting Willow, please contact our Training Coordinator at training@animalaidsociety.org\n\n* Will consider interested applications outside of a 45 mile radius of the shelter.\n\nCollie \u2013 Border & Retriever \u2013 Black Labrador **  Active & Playful ** I don\u2019t like kids **  Youth (2-5 Years)  **  I Like Select Dogs  **  31 \u2013 40 Pounds",

Unfortunately for Dempsey, before he came to rescue the majority of his life was spent in a crate. In spite of this, he is incredibly loving and affectionate. He does have anxiety issues and an inability to focus from this forced confinement. \n\n Now that he gets plenty of exercise and some medication for anxiety he is running, playing, and loving life. He enjoys playing with calmer dogs and is good with cats.\n\nDempsey does need a family experienced with herding dogs that will continue focus training and give him plenty of fun activities and exercise; no children under 12 years.

            "description": "This little cutie is Colt.  He is a Border Collie mix, maybe with lab. We are not exactly sure what his DNA says, but we know he is a super cute, friendly puppy ready to find his forever home.  At around 16 lbs now, we think Colt will be in the range of 50-60 lbs when full grown.\n\nBorn in early November 2020, Colt is happy, loves food, playtime and people!! He is smart, loving and easy going.  He will need great socialization to help him grow into a well-mannered adult dog. Colt is a lower key guy who still wants to go for walks with his people and see the world, but he wouldn't be a great fit for a family interested in a running partner. Colt wants opportunities to learn through obedience classes and mental engagement (trick training, games, puzzles).\n\nColt can be an only dog in his forever home.  He would not mind a friendly canine sibling to model great behavior and play with.  Because of his sharp puppy teeth, homes with older kids will be considered. For his safety, we will also prefer homes with physically fenced yards: he is too young for invisible fencing.\n\nFamilies that work outside the home need to include information in their application about how they will accommodate potty training because Colt may not be left home alone for more than a few hours a day. \n\nColt is located in the Minneapolis, MN area. If you think you're a good fit for him, please fill out an application at hoabcr.org/how-to-adopt \n\nAs a foster-based rescue, we do not have a central facility to visit. Meet and greets with specific dogs are arranged once your adoption application (not an inquiry email through Petfinder) has been received, processed, and approved. We are located in Minnesota and adopt to an area 400 miles from Minneapolis/St. Paul.\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies is $400 + MN sales tax. This fee includes spay or neuter at the age of 5 months at one of our veterinary clinics. Puppies are up to date on vaccinations at the time of adoption.\n",

Benz knows how to walk well on a leash, and will only start goofing around when you let her know that it's okay. She appears to be kennel trained, doesn't chew up any of her blankies or toys (unless of course, there's a peanut butter filled Kong around- who could resist those?!) and makes a great space heater if you want to snuggle up and take a nap with her :) If all of this hasn't sold you on her already... Just take a look at those irresistable green eyes! She's quite the beauty and outgoing with both humans and dogs. She could thrive in a single person household or with a full family- we do suggest bringing your dogs to meet her so you can be assured that the love is mutual! Sounds like quite the catch, huh? Give the shelter a call so we can schedule a time for you to meet this extraordinary lady!",

            "description": "Bailey is a sweet, loving, silly, submissive girl. She had a rough start and is shy, but she has blossomed into a playful girl that loves to have fun or snuggle. She enjoys playing with other dogs, snuggling with cats, snuggling with her humans, playing with her people and other dogs, chasing toys and tennis balls, walks, and enjoying her fenced-in yard. She is very food motivated (even veggies, kibble), so that is a big help with training. She is also play-motivated. She would adore a home with another dog for her to play with, and she plays with her foster sibling, who is a fraction of her size, safely (it provides her foster parents plenty of entertainment and laughs). In fact, by being gentle, non-threatening, and persistent, she is the first dog to ever get her foster sister to play! She knows sit (hand signal, verbal), off, has a great recall in the backyard, and is a treat-catching star (very entertaining)! She enjoys sleeping in her crate or with her humans and is mostly potty trained. While we\u2019re unsure of her history, she\u2019s wary of people hovering over her, and she\u2019s very sensitive to human body language, so that can be used to her new family\u2019s advantage to help her feel more comfortable. Bailey has worked so hard and overcome so much to trust humans, and she deserves a wonderful forever home with humans who love her.  She's about 2 years old and 20 lbs.\nBailey would do best with:\n\u00b7       No younger children. Any older children should be patient and gentle.\n\u00b7       Minimal car rides, at least for now. She gets car sick.\n\u00b7       Another dog to play with\nAdoption fee $400\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority! Please fill out an Adoption Application at https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/",

She was found as a stray with her puppies, so she is very shy and shutdown and will need a lot of time and patience to allow her to slowly come out of her shell. She will need a quiet and laid back home with a fenced in yard to settle into that understands she has been through a lot! She would be best in a home with another dog however she cannot live with cats, and children 12 years old and up. Her adoption fee is $295 and includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines and flea/tick treatments. She did test positive for heart worm before coming to our facility but has been treated and is ready for her new home!

            "description": "Hemlo, I'm Arlo. I lub tummy rubs and head pats and booty scratches and snacks. I really lub snacks. I like the cronchy snacks and squishy snacks and sticky snacks. I lub when my hoomans gibs me snacks and make me sniff em out wif my nose. I lub this thing they call training because they call me a good boy when I sit and DEY GIBS ME MORE SNACKS! WHHHAAATT!!\n\nArlo came to the Liberty Animal Shelter as a stray on 01/19/2021. We are now seeking the perfect home that can give him all of the love and attentions that he deserves. Arlo has been tested with both dogs and cats, and did well with both. He is a highly treat motivated puppy. We believe Arlo to be a German Shepherd and Great Dane mix based on physical appearance. He is also estimated to be between 10 and 12 months of age and currently weighs 60 lbs.\n\nArlo has an $80.00 adoption fee to cover the cost of his sterilization procedure, distemper combo and bordetella vaccinations and dewormer. There will be additional fees due to the veterinarian at the time of service for a Rabies vaccination and Heartworm test. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Arlo you will need to complete an adoption application at the link provided https://www.libertymissouri.gov/DocumentCenter/View/193/Animal-Adoption-Application?bidId= . Appointments to meet Arlo are scheduled for individuals with approved applications. For all other questions please contact the Liberty Animal Shelter staff at 816.439.4791 or ACO@Libertymo.gov",

            "description": "Bishop is a handsome Red Nose Pit Bull. Bishop came to us from a family that unfortunately did not have enough time for him. He has spent a lot of time in a kennel and will need some training. He is a very sweet boy, and loves to play. He needs someone that will have time to run with him and play.  He dearly wants a home that will be his forever home. \n\nBishop is 8 months old. His current weight is around 50/55 pounds. He will be neutered and up to date on shots. \n\nHis fee is $150.00. The adoption fee includes the initial vaccines, spay/neuter surgery, microchipping and a deworming. \n\nWe are currently only open by appointment. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our workers/volunteers that are there to take care of the animals. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nPlease visit our website to fill out an application so we can better assist you in your search for your next fur baby.  http://www.achs-pets.com/Application.html \n\nWe are a BEST MATCH facility. We try to match the pet\u2019s personality and needs with the family\u2019s needs and lifestyle to increase the likelihood of a lifetime happy relationship for the whole family. The online application we provide on our website, achs-pets.com, is a preliminary application. After you have completed the application, please give us 3 to 5 business days to process it. We check vaccine records for current & past pets as well as Landlord approval if you do not own your home. We hope you will understand our effort to provide our animals with the best new situation that is possible.",

            "description": "Meet Beanie! This sweet little nugget was abandoned in a dog park, tied to a fence. She was out there for most of the day as passers-by noticed her but assumed someone was coming back for her. Finally, at dusk, a Good Samaritan realized no one was coming and contacted Animal Control for help. Unfortunately, the local shelter is experiencing a Covid outbreak, and its employees are minimal, so there was no plan to help her. The Good Samaritan took her in and contacted Worthy Dog for help. We took her to the vet right away and confirmed she's a young, healthy pup who just needs a better family.\n\nBeanie has been fostered with both small and large dog, and does well with both. She loves to play, wrestle, and run zoomies with her dog buddies. She's a fast pup, too, and needs to be watched around open doors at first. She doesn't necessarily want to flee, but she may take the chance to explore until she learns the rules of your home. Her foster mom has used the crate when there's a lot of in and out activity. Beanie will bark for a very short time, and settle down and lay there quietly until let out.\n\nBeanie has proven herself to be a confident, active, feisty, spunky, sassy, vocal, and sweet loving puppy. She is everything that goes with a puppy. She is bright, inquisitive, and learns quickly. She is mouthy and wants to play by nipping at things - she may nip at your ankles, shoes, etc. She is still learning manners and needs some basic correction with a water bottle and a firm \"no\" to learn this is not appropriate behavior. Like all young pups, she needs a commitment to daily exercise, playtime, and lots of chew toys to entertain her.\n\nAs far as her people skills, she is a very affectionate pup who loves to sit on your lap and cuddle. She's crate trained, sleeps well through the night, and will put herself to bed when she's tired. She's mostly house trained and had a couple of potty incidents the first few days in her foster home, but nothing since. She knows to \"go potty\" outside and does her business in pretty short order when you take her out. She is not food aggressive, and is generally well-mannered and gentle when she takes treats.\n\nBeanie is getting daily walks with the rest of her pack and loves to go outside. She may pull a little but quickly figures out the pace and adjusts. She tends to bark at new people at first but will settle down. She's too vocal for a condo dog and would benefit from another social, playful pup in her home to learn from. While she's not being fostered with kids, we think she would be fine with older kids who understand she's mouthy and not biting to be mean. She's been around the neighbor kids (9 and 13 years old), and Beanie loved them. She doesn't mind being picked up and carried and has made friends with the neighborhood dogs, so she is social by nature.\n\nBeanie is a charming, fun pup with adorable big ears. She's going to make some lucky family very happy and just needs adopters who are ready to work through puppy mode.\n\nNo Condos\nBest paired with another young playful pup\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Chihuahua/Dachshund Mix\nGENDER: Female\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 12 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 10 to 11 months old\nCOAT TYPE: Short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/spayed/microchipped/\nLOCATION: Reston, VA\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

            "description": "Meet our shepherd girls, Gris and her \"mom\" Freddi. They are a bonded pair and we do wish that they stayed together. These 2 sweet girls came from a less than wonderful background where routine healthcare was lacking. Both girls will be spayed on February 4th. Fredrica, black and tan, is approximately 8 years old. She has ear and skin issues. She is missing patches of hair due to fleas, but with proper medical treatment, she is feeling better and fur is growing back. Her daughter, Gris is approximately 4 years old. She too had ear issues at some point, but it appears to have cleared up. Gris and Freddi are very in tune to each other. One is always seeking out the other. They do not crave human attention, but maybe they haven't really received KIND human attention, until now. They are tolerant and pleasant girls. VERY playful They love chasing each other in the big yard, stealing toys from each other like there is only 1 toy in the yard! Watching them run free and happy is great! If you have room in your home and heart for these girls, please send your application soon!  \n\n\nPerry County Animal Rescue (PCoAR) 717-589-3005 Millerstown, PA www.perrycountyanimalrescue.org\n\nThe girls met Ned the rescue cat. Ned said they are fine. Girl had no interest ion him what so ever. He was insulted but got over it. He would be willing to hang out with them. We agree. The girls seem fine with cats.",

Tucker is ready to join a home where he is the center of attention, the apple of someone\u2019s eye, co-pilot, lap warmer, walking companion and couch snuggler.  \n\nTucker is sweet, smart and about 2 years old.  His current foster mom has been enjoying getting to know him and his joy for life.  He is awesome in the car, good leash skills and loves his walks around the hood and on trails.  He has learned the doggie door and has access to the outdoors and is house-broken.  He has good manners in the home. \n\nTucker is the guy who wants to have a full time job being your best friend and he can adapt to many situations which makes him perfect for joining his family on outings, going to work, helping with errands, etc..    Tucker is not the guy who will be happy being left alone.  He really wants to be that special someone in your life.  He is a loving, playful and active fella that will enjoy a similar human mom and/or dad.\n\nHe does live with another small dog in his foster home and did well with other dogs at the shelter, however we are looking for a home without any dogs as he would prefer to have a lap all to himself.   \nTucker is also learning basic skills such as sit and stay and does stay in the crate at night, but would be in heaven to be able to snuggle in bed with his person/people. \n\nThis boy is ready to bring some serious love and friendship into a home. We are looking for the home that yearns for that canine companionship that a dog like Tucker can bring.  \n \nTucker is being fostered in Essex Junction, VT.    We\u2019re looking for a family with no other dogs, dog savvy kitties okay,  children over 10, and home more often than not. \n\nApply here:  http://longtraildogs.org/adoption-application/\n",

From completely shutdown to confident companion, our little guy is now ready to live his best life in his perfect forever home. \n\nJoey is a 16lb Yorkie/ Silky Terrier  (Aprox) eight years old being fostered in the DFW area. He\u2019s completely blind but that doesn\u2019t stop him from loving life! Joey has fit right in with his foster\u2019s own dogs who range from young to geriatric, from less than five pounds to over 120 pounds. He also doesn\u2019t mind the cats and happily follows his foster mom around the house, often curling up on a rug or cushion wherever she might be.\n\nSweet Joey is crate and house trained. He goes outside in a courtyard to potty and follows the sound to come when called. He\u2019s a quiet boy and not a barker. His perfect person is someone who is home most of the time and will have patience while he learns his way around his new home. Joey lifts his body to be picked up and loves to be petted and cuddled. He also really, really loves treats!\n\nWant to meet this special little dude? To apply, go to https://www.camorescue.com/adoption-application.",

Weiss is adjusting to his new situation and appreciates a little time to get to know you, then he is outgoing, sweet and affectionate once comfortable. He doesn\u2019t really understand the leash thing yet, but he is intelligent and responsive and will be a quick study with the right training and experience. He has a medium level of energy. In playgroups, he is quite curious and sociable, including when it comes to meeting other dogs, with whom he behaves in a genial and appropriate manner. Weiss and Sambria are looking for a happy-ever-after home together.\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

I decided I did not like the neighbor's dogs and this became a big issue for us all. That being said, I DID live with a small female dog and a cat. I was not the nicest to the cat and wasn't interested in sharing food with her. So cats will be a MAYBE. I would never hurt, but I am a big boy and I may hurt in my play. I am a bit of a drooler and won't mind having my face wiped or my paws when I come in from outside. I will bring my leash when you ask me to or I'm ready to go out for potty. I will crate if I have to. I love my toys and play time. I will sit proper like a gentleman and know other simple manners too. I will clean up after you, if you leave socks or underwear lying around. But I just might eat them! I'm looking for an easygoing life. A couch potato with some snuggles sound good to me! I will need an owner who can handle a big boy like myself. Someone who can be firm. I do have a guarding instinct that is part of my breed, but I am a love bug too. I am hoping for an owner who has experience with my breed. If that's you, send an application soon! \n\n\nPerry County Animal Rescue (PCoAR) 717-589-3005 Millerstown, PA www.perrycountyanimalrescue.org\n\nHubert met Ned, the rescue dog tester and he has decided Hubert is not good with cats.

It is clear that she has had a litter or two but she doesn't let that slow her down!\nWhile she has gotten along great with other dogs, kids, and cats she is an independent dog who is very happy to lounge on her bed all day, and does not require another dog in the home to be fulfilled.\nLeila does great in her crate but has been nondestructive if left out and is completely house trained.\nLeila is heartworm positive and needs to be spayed still, treatment is completely taken care of by SSR for this.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

            "description": "Click my picture for more info. on me!\nMeet Dia!\n\nDia is new to FHS, so we are only starting to get to know her. She is a one year old hound mix- probably with some Walker Coonhound in there. She is a lovely, sweet girl who likes to show off her sassy smarts. Like how she can get out of the fence, only to sit on the other side of it as a taunt.\n\nShe is a lovable girl who enjoys cuddling up with her family. Dia is good with other dogs and came to us from a large household. She is also good with kids, but she can be very bouncy and can easily knock small children over. She is a little unsure of leaving her home, so she is quiet with us for now and is only starting to come out of her shell. We will add more as we get to know her.\n\nIf you are interested in her, fill out an application at\nwww.fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nDue to COVID-19, we are not able to facilitate meet and greets until a family is approved and then only at the foster family's discretion. At this time, we are not holding dog adoptions at Petsmart.\n\n**Applications can take anywhere from 5-7 business days to complete. When filling out an application, please scroll down after submitting it to be sure that the website accepted it and check for a confirmation email to be sure that your application went through. We respond by email, so please check your spam and trash folders.**\n\nWe are located in Fayette County, GA and are a foster based rescue without a shelter building.\n\nEstimated DOB: 12/19/2019\nAdoption fee: $250\n\nCLICK HERE to APPLY TO ADOPT\nor paste the following link in your browser: https://fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\nFor full details about ADOPTING, please visit our Adoption Guide (https://fayettehumane.org/adoption-information/adoption-guide/).\n\nAll our dogs are tested for heartworms, spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.\n\nCats are tested for FLV/FIV when age appropriate, as kittens tested at an age less than 16 weeks tends to lead to unreliable results. All our cats are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.",

He is super friendly and sweet, and loves getting cuddles and lying across your lap or leaning into you. He\u2019ll make you feel like a million bucks!!!!\n\nBuddy is 10 yrs old and weighs in around 100 pounds. We think he is a mastiff mix, and he has the most gentle and loving personality. \n\nBuddy would love a home where his humans are around a lot, and where he can get tons of attention. He gets along well with other dogs and cats, and has a great mix of energy and mellowness. \n\nBuddy has a tendency to have allergies and itchy skin, so he needs a good quality limited ingredient food. He is also currently on an allergy medication that seems to be helping too.\n\nWe are partnering with Golden Growls Senior Rescue to find this gentle giant a loving forever home. Please help us spread for Buddy, and if you are interested in him please fill out our adoption survey: https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/. Thanks!!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

Amongst his doggy peers, male and female, Scout\u2019s personality shines. His comfort level grows when he has a pal, so we think he would love a canine friend. Walking in a pack helps Scout with leash comfort, and he\u2019s in no hurry. A nice stroll is just fine with him. Scout\u2019s forever family will need to be patient and gentle with him, so he will learn just how wonderful having his very own family will feel like \u2013 safe, sound and secure. We think an adult home would be best. Come down and you will fall in love with his tender heart.\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "*** Avail Wednesday 1/27 *** Siena is a young hound mix. She is a very friendly dog and greets everyone she meets with a wagging tail. She seems especially fond of children, and always gives them her \"full body wag\". She loved getting pets from all the neighborhood children! Siena is housebroken and sleeps quietly in her crate all night with no accidents. She made great progress with leash walking using an EZ Walk Harness. She often gets excited when she sees other dogs while on a walk, but is easily distracted with high-value treats (she's very fond of hot dogs!). Siena will sit on command. Siena played very nicely with the resident dog who was of similar size. She enjoyed running and playing in the fenced backyard. Siena would sometimes fetch a ball (if there was a treat involved) but she would also be just as happy to play with a ball by herself, tossing the ball in the air and then chasing it. Siena loves stuffed toys, especially ones that squeak. She thoroughly enjoys chewing on a Benebone, but didn't show much interest in a frozen peanut butter Kong. Siena is a sweet, friendly dog who has a lot of love to share with her lucky forever family! Make an appointment to come and meet her today!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

That is wonderful news because I have a lot of health concerns. You see I was hurt badly a long time ago. I can't remember what happened, but I had to have one of my legs removed. So, I am ready to retire to a calm home, with positive people. I do like most dogs, I haven't met any kitties yet. I really love food, so you should feed me separately. I am house trained and I am a very sweet girl. Geez, I almost forgot my breed. I am a 67 pound, 7.5 year old Gordon Setter and I am patiently waiting to meet my new family, so I can start my new life!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

She has tons of pep in her step, and loves adventures outside. This bouncy girl will take attention, but is also cool and independent, enjoying her \"me time\". Ideally, she'll find a quiet home to live out the rest of her days comfortably, with an equally cool human to bunk with. She loves hanging out in the fresh air and bird watching, so if you're looking for a porch buddy, Ziva is your girl. \n\nOKAY WITH DOGS? Can play well with certain dogs outside - can NOT live with another dog. \nOKAY WITH CATS? No. \nGOOD WITH KIDS? No. \n\n- To learn if this pet is still available for adoption, please check their adoption profile on our Adopets site, by visiting www.ucspca.org. - \nIf they are not listed on that site, or the Adopt Me button has been deactivated, we have received multiple applications for that pet and are not accepting any more at this time.

Holt is a 1 year old bulldog mix who is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm tested negative. Holt is a different kind of dog- he has never played with toys so everything is totally new to him. He is super food motivated which is making training so much easier. Holt has never met a stranger, kids included. If there are other dogs in the home, Holt would prefer them to be on the calmer, laid back side. We do know he does not do well with cats. If you\u2019re interested in adopting Holt, please go to our website and fill out an adoption application. Once received, a staff member will be in touch.",

            "description": "Misty von Milow is a stunning 1-2 year old German Shepherd. This mid-energy, sweet girl is still trying to figure out her situation. She seems lovely, she just needs some reassurance and time to adjust. She is getting used to the rescue and becoming more sure of herself day by day. On the leash, she can be a bit shy but ultimately walks well and can walk in a pack of other dogs. Misty enjoys being by her human\u2019s side, whether that\u2019s out on walks, getting pets or head scratches back at the rescue or out in the yard during playtime with other pups. She prefers calm dogs like herself but generally sticks to herself or her humans. She is a pleasure to be around and it\u2019s even more rewarding to see her become more and more comfortable every day. Will you be the one to help her continue her life journey?\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

You can call me Lolo the Lover, because I\u2019m ready to bring the love and snuggles when you adopt me!\n\nDo you like to cuddle? Do you have room for me to curl up in your lap? I love to be held! I\u2019m also great at giving kisses, so pucker up! I get along great with kids and other dogs too, so I won\u2019t mind sharing the love.\n\nThe only thing I don\u2019t like to share is food. I\u2019m still worried that I won\u2019t get enough, so I can be aggressive when I feel someone is honing in on my meals. If you feed me by myself, I\u2019ll be just fine!\n\nThey say all you need is love, but I like to think all you need is love and Lolo! You can never have too many snuggles, so what are you waiting for? Fill out an application today and get ready for a little more--no, a lot more--love in your life!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lolo, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n",

This is a story  about two young parents who were raising a family and suddenly found their world uprooted. Fortunately, Westside was there for them. Sambria, as might be expected, is unsure of her new surroundings and is hesitant at first to interact, looking back over her shoulder for Weiss and the reassurance she has in his presence. When she is comfortable, her sweet and sensitive personality comes out and she responds nicely to gentle affection.  Evaluated in playgroup, Sambria seems to have a medium energy. She is great off leash, curious about the environment and all the other dogs around. With Weiss at her side, she socializes graciously within the pack. Sambria and Weiss are looking for a happy-ever-after home where they can remain together.\n\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page! So, check in and log on often! \n\nwww.sheprescue.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n",

Our veterinary partner estimates Mable to be 2 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Maple is super friendly with people and other dogs. We found Mable in a kill shelter in Georgia emaciated and suffering with an old fracture of her femur which had never been treated. We immediately busted Mable out of there and brought her to our veterinary partner for the medical treatment she so desperately needed. Unfortunately, Mable's left rear leg required amputation, but that won't stop this low rider lady from living a fantastic life in the forever home that we know is out there waiting for Mable. If you can open your heart, home and family to Mable, please apply online to adopt Mable (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "\nMaggie von Maintal is a delightful 7 month old Shepherd mix.  Already over 75lbs, she'll be quite large when fully grown. Out of the gate of her kennel, this darling girl shows off her bright, joyful personality. She is eager to experience life and whatever is coming next. While she pulls a bit on her leash, she'll slow down with a reminder that there\u2019s no hurry and she won\u2019t be late to the party.  She does very well meeting and walking with her new pup friends. Off leash, joining playgroups, she comes in with high expectations of good fun and pleasant companionship. She makes her rounds, exploring her new surroundings and meeting every dog with a wagging tail. She loves to be the object of your full attention and affection and will cover you with kisses, if allowed.  She is content to take a break from her busy social life and sit right next to you, where she can observe the antics of her new friends and plan her next party.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Though I am a young girl, I came to my foster as a momma to a litter of puppies and I believe I have been a fantastic momma though I am very young. Being a young mom, I didn't have long to be a puppy myself and now? I am learning to play and have fun!\n\nNow, I am a nervous girl but I just want to be loved and cuddled like any other dog. I would probably do better in a home without little kids as being nervous means I may startle easily. Of course, being a nervous dog means I need someone who is patient with me. Once I relax, I will reward you with a very dedicated dog that will love you. Dogs like me give the best rewards with love and affection!\n\nI love other dogs as long they do not frighten me. I am not totally sure what scares me about them, but when they scare me, I bark, run, or I get as small as possible. I have shown no fear aggression and I don't know how I feel about cats.\n\nI am a very sweet girl though and I love to play! I love being outside and will need a fenced in yard to keep me safe.\n\nIf you are interested in me, you may submit an adoption application at savingdeathrowdogs.com to learn more about me.",

No apartments, please.\nFence Requirements: Preferred\nSpecial Info: Norris LOVES toys and will do anything for hot dogs! He seems to be housebroken already!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Pinto Bean is simply the sweetest perfect lady. She's a \"\"people person\"\" in a lovable dog body. This mixed breed, two-year-old is about 50 lbs. of wiggles who would do well in any home. She appears to know some commands and is eager to learn more as she settles into a life of fun and friendship. Pinto Bean has tested positive for heartworm, but FAMD does cover the cost of the treatment. Make an appointment to meet our very special Pinto Bean! All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

My name is Lucky. I am a nine-year-old Lab/Staffy mix female. But don't let my age or gray hair fool you. I love to play, chew on Kongs, go on long walks and even still run for a tiny bit when I can. Belly rubs are my absolute favorite! I can't get enough. I will just roll over for any human I meet and wait for my rubs. I also like to snuggle up next to you at the end of the day and just relax. I am ready to be an 'only fur child' of the house and receive all the love and attention that I can get and not have to share. I am told that I am pretty smart too and I know several tricks.\n\nThe ideal family for Lucky would be a home with adults who can still be active for her, no other pets and older children if there are still kids at home.\nIf you are interested in more info on me please reach out to the info below!\nKayla Gilmore\n505-280-2227\nKayla.j.gilmore@gmail.com\n\nMore about Lucky\n\nUp-to-date with vaccinations\n\nNot good with cats\n\nNot good with dogs\n\nGood with older kids\n\nHouse trained",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n\nHi! My name is Chanel and I am a 6-8 year old flat coated retriever mix. I've been called Tigger because I'm cheerful, outgoing, and bounce up and down on my back legs when I'm excited. I weigh around 45 pounds. I could probably weigh up to 50, but I shouldn't get any bigger than that! I am not typically a cuddly dog. I know better than to jump on the bed or couch and when I'm sleepy and want to lounge I'm just as happy to lay down a few feet away from you. I do like being pet and getting a belly rub on occasion. Rather than affection, I'd rather receive love in attention and food. I'm always hungry for a treat and only play with toys that feed me. With enough practice I might be able to set the record for cleaning out a frozen peanut butter Kong! \n Because I am very food driven and smart, I have a lot of potential to learn tricks and new skills. I can already sit and lay down like a pro, and have been practicing \"\"shake\"\" and \"\"stay\"\" recently. I have some hearing loss so I'm learning hand signs along with commands, but luckily my ears don't slow me down at all. \n I am a medium to high energy gal and do well with lots of exercise. I walk very well on leash and love going for walks. I typically walk 2 miles a day and could go much farther. I would be very happy with a family that likes to hike and maybe even run. While I'd enjoy a house with a big yard, I have a hard time occupying myself alone outside so having that structured exercise with my family is very important to me. \n I have general anxiety that makes it hard for me to stay calm and I have been jokingly called \"\"high maintenance\"\". I like to nap in the morning but can spend the afternoon and evening panting and pacing around looking for food and attention. Sometimes if I don't get what I want I will throw a fit and bark at my foster dad, so I need a family that will be strict enough to help me learn that's not ok. I take Trazodone to help me stay calm but can still get overstimulated or anxious and it's hard to tell what my trigger is. I am most anxious if I feel separated from my family including crated or gated in a single room. I am house trained and not destructive and I'm looking for a home that does not plan to crate me. I can go in the crate, but it causes me a lot of anxiety and I whine and bark when I'm in there. I also insist on sleeping next to my foster dad's bed every night and don't like to be alone at night. Because of my anxiety, I would be happiest in a house without close neighbors in case I bark and a family that is home a lot or will take me out with them. \n I am very friendly with strangers and seem friendly with other dogs as well. I want to talk to every dog I see while on a walk and had lots of fun meeting new dogs at the dog park. I have lived with other dogs in the past but have not been face to face with a cat. When I have seen them in their enclosures at the rescue I have not responded aggressively. I can be officially tested if requested! I have not been around children either, but I'm sure I'd be good with older kids that know how to respect animals.\n Overall, I am an adorable, sweet dog, who's biggest issue is that she might love and miss her family too much and not know how to express it. I need a family who will be around and will be patient and consistent with me as I learn the rules of the house and establish a routine that helps me thrive.",

If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n****ADULT ONLY QUIET HOME, NO CHILDREN****\n\nHi I'm Eddie! I'm six months old and about 40 pounds - but definitely still growing. I am very affectionate and love cuddles and kisses. I'm a quick learner and already know sit, wait, come, stay and potty. I have puppy energy, after enough stimulation I curl up right next to you on the couch. I like to guard my resources, though I'm getting better at that every day. My foster parents say I'm really good in the car, but I'm still working on leash training. I'm crate trained, but sometimes sleep in my own bed next to my foster parents at night. Sometimes I can be noisy, but it's only because I want to protect you! I'd be best in a family without young children. I must go to a cat free home. I love my doggy foster sister, but it would be ok if I was the only child in my new family. I'm looking for an experienced dog owner that can continue teaching me new tricks! \n\nI am neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

He's listed as Jack Russell mix -- we don't know mom or dad so your guess is as good as ours on breeds. He loves to play and loves attention; typical nippy puppy so needs a home with kids over 10 years of age. Marvin will require a home with another confident dog and a fenced yard. He is not potty trained as he's still a puppy, and must be adopted near the Des Moines metro to finish his vetting here. Marvin's adoption fee is $250. If interested in meeting him please apply at www.foreverhomedogs.org!All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. \n\nSenior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

He is 50-55 pounds, 1 1/2 yr old, and dog and kid friendly but has the timidness of a hound and since everything is still so new gets overwhelmed by loud household sounds and younger kids so would prefer a home with kids 12 and over. Will potty on-leash, sleeps well in a crate at night, likes to hang out on the sofa or outside in the sunshine on a nice day.\n\nContact this animals foster home at SaveMeAdoptMe@gmail.com or text or leave a message at 573-512-2102. The adoption donation of $120.00 covers spay / neuter, vaccinations, microchip with lifetime registration, deworming, negative heartworm test, and current monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.

Whatever he is, he will probably finish at 60lbs give or take a little, best guess.\n\nWe think he will adjust well into his new home, with lots of direction, love and care. He is currently working on potty training/crate training. Smart little guy!\n\nIf you are interested in having Woodrow as part of your family, reach out to his foster mom Liz at 214-616-6128, if you have some questions.\n\nWoodrow is neutered, up to date on vaccines, wormed, and even microchipped!\nIf you are interested in adopting him please fill out an application at https://shelter2rescue.org/DogAdoption.html",

Not only is Max handsome but he has the sweetest personality. Max loves to go for long walks, play with toys, especially kong toys, and loves water. This guy can't get enough of the sprinkler or kiddie pool. \nMax would do best in an extremely active home where he can get his energy out. Max's ideal living situation would be in a home where his people are home frequently so they can help Max build his confidence as Max gets anxious when left alone and can have an occasional accident. \nMax knows basic commands, is eager to please, can be hesitant around new people at first, but once he warms up, Max just wants all your love and attention. This guy loves his back scratches and belly rubs.\nMax is neutered and up to date on his shots and will be attending training at Our Companions next month. \nIf Max sounds like your man, please fill out an application today.",

I enjoy running around the yard and will need a fence at my new home. I need to be the only pet, but I am learning how to be more appropriate with other animals. I hope to find a family that will teach me how to be the best girl I can be. I enjoy using my nose and would love to do things that involve sniffing. \n\nBrazil is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed.Thank you for showing an interest in our pets. We can never guarantee the breeds of the animals. We do not DNA test. Please feel free to call us with any questions.",

Staff all fell in love with this handsome gent from the second he entered the building. Pretty hard not to; he's got the looks and charisma to melt any heart. \"\"Knickey B\"\" is quite special. He's tall and lanky, but has no qualms about laying his whole body right on top of an already established Pug pile. You know, to get more cushion for his afternoon nap. This sweetheart is just that; and he's great with his canine friends. Sometimes he'll follow a couple around the suite or \"\"talk\"\" by sniffing at them. He's got some hind-end weakness, so his tootsie's drag a bit when he walks, but don't let the imperfect gait fool you. Knickerbocker loves to walk and explore. He has quite the curious nose on that way-too-adorable face. If a scent has really peaked his interest, he'll get some speed going and start to trot like a horse! Anytime spent outdoors with you where he can grab some sun rays, will thrill him to pieces. Despite his age, our delightful friend still has lots of life left in him. Please consider inviting this special creature into your home and your heart.",

            "description": "Meet Blazer!!! Blazer is a beautiful 2 to 3 year old, 50 pound male, pointer and labrador retriever mix. He was found wandering the streets of town, alone, hungry and cold, but not shy. Blazer is an extrovert, never meeting a stranger. His exuberance and friendly nature is contagious. Yes, he is a little goofy but he is a happy kind of goofy and will keep you smiling with all his goofy antics. Blazer also loves to \"\"talk\"\" to you, speaking with hums when being scratched and little yelps when at play, plus, he will bark an announcement at visitors, whether it's a car pulling into your driveway or a deer spotted in the backyard. My mom would have referred to this particular job as her \"\"redneck security system\"\". Blazer is very playful and energetic so regular exercise and a few dog toys will help keep him out of mischief. If you are looking for a jogging partner, Blazer is your man. He gets along with other dogs very well after a slow introduction, especially with the ladies and considering how handsome he is, it's no wonder he considers himself a ladies man. Blazer also gets along with older children, his size and enthusiasm at play is a concern with small children and toddlers. He has a sweet nature and loves attention. He is fully vaccinated, neutered and heartworm negative. Blazer is looking for a family of his own to love with an active lifestyle and a home to settle into.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc.

            "description": "This handsome big boy is Big Red, he is a Shepherd/Lab/Black Moth Cur possibly or simply a big friendly doggy. He was found roaming the streets by himself when taken to a very rural shelter. We offered to try to find this big fella a forever home here in WI so he doesn't have to live the shelter life anymore. He is friendly with people, loves everyone but recommend no small children since he may accidentally knock them down. And does great with other dogs with proper intro of course. He will need to relearn house and crate manners though since he has been residing at the shelter. He loves to go on walks but he likes to lead the way, so perhaps some more training on this as well. He loves to hang out and enjoy the weather or goof around with other dogs to bide the day away. He is now hoping he can find a real forever home to call his own now, he would love to be someone's sidekick and pal. If your looking for a friendly big fella like this an online application can be found at SandiPaws.org\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc.
