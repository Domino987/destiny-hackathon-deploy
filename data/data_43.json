I am 1-2 years old and an easy going boy. I am a full grown boy at 35 lbs. I love kids, I love other dogs, and I passed a cat test with flying colors. I\u2019ll be ready for my own home soon so apply soon.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more.

Once she has gotten to know you, Betty will be your new best friend (especially if you share treats with her!) Betty enjoys the company of other polite mellow dogs.  She is approximately 1 year old and heartworm negative. When you first meet Betty she is quiet and wary of meeting new people.  But once you spend time with her she warms up and will stay right by your side. Betty is soulful, completely sweet and just beautiful. Betty will sit, come and is very treat motivated so training Betty is easy. When Betty is comfortable she has the most adorable zoomies ever! \nBetty needs a calm household to decompress and to know she will be safe and loved then Betty White can be her true sweet self. Betty does good with calmer dogs. Since Betty needs a calm environment it is best there are no children in the home. \nBetty White is an American Pitbull mix, approx 1 year old and approx 40 pounds of adorable.",

He seems to be really well socialized with people and dogs. He plays nicely with our female dog and was temperament tested with male dogs at the shelter. Ranger is house trained, crate trained, and doesnt do too bad on a leash either (he has long legs and tends to walk at a fast pace but doesnt really pull). So far he has not reacted at all to other dogs, cats or squirrels on walks. Ranger is a super chill, low energy guy most of the time and loves nothing more then napping either in his crate, on the couch, or on a nice dog bed. He doesnt seem to have a preference with toys, he pretty much loves them all, and is always down for a game of fetch with a ball or stick. Ranger would do well as a family dog and would be a fantastic companion for trips to the park and dog park! Ranger A593852 1Y Male 54.6 lbs, Heartworm Negative",

Funny enough my color is baby blue. What can I say? It suits me (: I'm super friendly and I love all the cuddles and back scratches and believe me, when I want some attention i'll let you know. I am super vocal, some would even call me a singer with the notes I hit. My singing skills are how I get your attention, you'll hear my awooos from anywhere! By the way have you seen my floppy ears? I think they are one of my greatest features about me! With my ears you'd think with a couple flaps I'd take off flying, but don't worry the one place I want to be is right next to you giving you some smooches. Come visit me and my floppy ears! I might even sing you a little song. I am heartworm positive but my treatment is included with my adoption fee and will be administered at the shelter!",

My name is Ziggy and I am a Pomeranian: They call me a PomPom. I am 5 years young. My foster Mom tells me that I am a bit fat and that I definitely need to go on a strick diet because I should weigh 20 lbs. How dare she! I am just pleasantly plump. \n\nI find myself looking for a forever home because my Mommy went to heaven. She had something called cancer and I stayed next to her until she fell asleep. I miss her terribly and I hope she is happy, young and healthy wherever heaven is. Maybe she also has plenty of food there too since she use to let me nibble every now and then. My foster mom said: No snacks for you Ziggy! you are too fat! \n\nI am a happy boy. I follow my foster Mom everywhere and like to lay by her feet.  If I\u2019m lucky, I try to hop into her bed.  There is another dog here and she is my girlfriend. Her name is Pepper and I would love to be adopted together with her. I love riding in the car so when I hear the car keys I run and wait by the door. I am potty trained for pee pads but my foster Mom told me that I better get used to going outside. I am a gentleman and I am well behaved and don't really bark too much so I could be happy in a house or an apartment in the city. I also walk very well on leash! I told you I am a gentleman. \n\nI am looking for my forever home. I promise you I will be by your side for the rest of my life. I will put a smile on your face every day and will warm your heart at night. One little favor though... can you give me a treat to nibble every now and then? \n\nLove\nZiggy\n\nTo adopt Ziggy please complete an adoption application at www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org \n\nDue to the large number of applications we can't get back to you so please check our website for your pet of choice adoption status. \nSorry we cannot adopt out of the state of IL",

            "description": "MEET BELLA!  Bella is a 7-year-old Staffy mix.  She's a sweet and loving dog that just wants a safe place to call home.  Bella has a medical condition called Dry Eye which requires the application of daily eyedrops for the rest of her life.  She also has some skin lesions on her hind legs that are currently healing.  Bella is still a very strong girl, and would not be a good fit with children due to the combination of her strength and poor sight.  She would be a great fit in a home with adults that will take the time to create a safe space for her.  In the right environment, she will be happy and thrive!  She still has several years left to love and be loved.  She is looking for a foster or forever home!\n\n**** If you see a pet posted from us, they are AVAILABLE (we update constantly). Please apply right away as opposed to inquiring about if they are available.

            "description": "Baby Girl is a 2-year-old female Pointer mix who must be spayed before she is adopted. She came to PAHS as an owner turn in because she kept getting out of their fenced yard. Baby Girl is white with brown markings; she is a very pretty girl. She currently weighs 42 pound so she is considered to be a medium sized adult dog. Baby Girl is active, playful, and would need a nice secure yard where she can safely play. She gets along well with other dogs and would be fine with children. BG is leash trained; and she is very well behaved and calm when walking on her leash. This gorgeous girl is ready for a new family and a new life. Come meet our Baby Girl beauty queen soon and see if she wouldn't be a nice fit for your family.Dog/puppy adoption fees are $120 and cat/kitten adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative.",

She came in with an upper respiratory infection, a skin issue,  and an issue with one of her eyes (all are being treated). Also, she is missing an eye. However, she is still a very beautiful dog with a sweet demeanor. She is being fostered by someone who has dogs, cats, and kids, and she does well with them all. She is housebroken. This girl is NOT large. She is more of a Boxer size. She doesn't bite or chew things. She's a good girl. Doesn't jump on you but gets excited at times... but that's normal. :)\nShe will make a great companion for the right person(s).\n\nShe just wants love and we are glad that we are able to help get her to a home that will provide the love that she deserves!\n\nSend in your application today to see if she is a good match for your home!\n\nFee is $300",

We are not a shelter, it doesn't mean we've met or evaluated the dog, it means we are trying to help this owner find a good, responsible and most of all a loving home.\n\nThe below statements were written by the owner:\n\nI have a 5 year old German Shepherd named Tank. \n\nHis birthday is April 7th, 2015. He weighs 90 lbs. \n\nUnfortunately, my living situation is going to be changing soon in which Tank will need rehomed. \n\nTank has all of his shots and is up to date on all of them. He is not neutered though. (Tank will go out on a neuter contract and will be neutered)\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to interact with other dogs or cats as he\u2019s always been a single dog in his home. \n\nHe\u2019s great with kids and adults, but he has a tendency to be rather vocal and may jump a bit out of excitement.  He knows his basic commands and is potty trained. He\u2019d make a great pet for someone who loves to play fetch as that\u2019s his favorite pastime. He\u2019s super energetic and loyal. \n\nHe was crate trained, however doesn\u2019t like to be in one. He\u2019s left loose in the house when we\u2019re not home and he\u2019s not destructive at all. \n \nHe doesn\u2019t walk well at all on a leash, but would love to go for walks. If someone has the patience to train him to walk on a leash, he\u2019d love it. He loves car rides, however paces back and forth and doesn\u2019t sit still.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this dog please fill out the adoption application: https://www.dogshope.com/adoption_application2.html",

He has a great nose though, and loves to get away from the noise of the kennel environment and sniff up all the exciting scents and forget about his troubles. Walking on the leash is a new excitement for Harley, and he is already learning that the leash represents fun. He is a smart and sweet boy.",

Casper would do best in a home without other pets or small children.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

            "description": "Meet Bucky!\n\nHello, I'm Bucky. For the first time in my whole life I'm starting to feel special, and not just because my special needs. I was born somewhere around June 2019, making me about a year and a half old, and I weigh about 60 pounds. I was recently rescued from the place I was living, in a shop, not being well cared for, and now I get to find a family who will love me for me! You see, I'm likely a distemper survivor, which isn't as common as one would think, but there isn't a test to see if that's what is going on, but it's probable. So, I might be a little wobbly, but I'm really just a \"normal\" dog. I'm housetrained, and rarely have accidents anymore. I am also crate trained, although I do need a little help getting in, but if you just toss a couple treats in there, that helps me alot. I love people of all ages and even snuggle up for nap time with the 4 year old human that lives in my foster home. But, since I do wobble and fall sometimes, maybe I shouldn't be around really little ones unless you will be close, so I don't knock them over or fall on them. I love playing with other dogs, or at least trying, but I have some limitations and I would need to live with a very patient dog if there is one in my new home. One that understands I'm not trying to hurt them or be mean, and isn't scared of my unique walk. There aren't any cats in my foster home, but I'm almost certain I would be able to meet one for the right family!\n\nI'd love a family who isn't super active since I can't go on long walks. I love to be by my humans! I really need a family who promises to always be patient with me. I will make for a good snuggle bug for my forever people. Even though I can't do all the things other dogs can, I sure do try, and I can for sure still love with my whole being! I'm sure my love and goofy walk will be enough for someone, right?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

            "description": "Ramiro is a 4 year old Malinois who was originally purchased abroad and trained for narcotics detection. He worked for a private company for a number of years, and then was donated to a small police department near St Louis. Unfortunately, he is unable to pass narcotic certification and, as a result, cannot have a career as a K9. He does not have apprehension/agitation/aggression training, and was never trained in any sort of bite work. He has a solid ball drive, and has been able to get along with other male and female dogs.\n\nRamiro is on Apoquil daily for skin allergies. He has shown a high prey drive, so no cats or small animals. Past owner reported he has interacted with children from 1 year to 12 years old and is non-reactive to strangers; MAD Rescue has not confirmed this information or child-tested this dog. He is reported to be skittish around large 18-wheeler trucks and loud sirens. He also has a bit of separation anxiety so someone who works from home or isn't gone for long periods would be preferable.\n\nRamiro loves tennis balls and will fetch until his human is too tired. Ramiro keeps a clean kennel and likes to sleep in his crate when he gets tired. This is a beautiful dog who needs an involved owner who isn't a push-over.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organization that does not have a physical location.

(He is getting neutered and a vet checkup on 01/22/2021)\n\nHousebroken: Yes but can dribble when he gets excited. He is also VERY interested in all of the smells left around the house so he wears a belly band as of right now. That will hopefully change after his neuter. \n\nCrate trained: Yes, he goes right in. Occasionally he will make some noise but that is improving. \nGood in the car: Yes\nGood on a leash: Yes, with pinch collar. He can be strong when he gets on a scent he wants to check out \nEnergy level: Low (ZERO interest in toys) \nNeed a fenced in yard: Not necessary with daily walks. If left outside in our yard, hell just sit at the door and cry to come back in the house. \n\nDog Friendly: Said to be. Hes still in the 2 week shutdown at our house. I can update with how introductions go with resident dogs.\n\nIf yes, does your foster need another dog in its adoptive homes? No\n\nCat Friendly? No, he was VERY interested in getting to the cat on the other side of the fence when tested. \n\nKid Friendly: Yes, has previously lived with kids \nIf yes, what's the youngest child you'd recommend they be placed with? \n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them?\nSampson is a handsome guy looking for a forever family to call his own. He is a real quick learner and has been practicing his sit-stays on place. He is very gentle with taking treats but has no toy drive. He is such a gentleman that he doesnt even jump on people or try to get on the furniture. He is still settling in here at his foster home but so far he has been very sweet without showing much enthusiasm over anything other than treats and his food. We will be updating in the coming weeks as we learn more about him.",

I love to cuddle especially while you work from home, but I am also perfectly content in my crate. Anytime you leave my sight, I will cuddle with your slippers instead. I hardly ever whine and never bark, so I make a great companion. I do a happy dance when I am about to go on a long walk and am getting more used to my leash. Always keep it tight because sometimes I want to slip out to be free. I am really good at reading the room, so if you want to play, I'll play, but if you want to chill, I'll chill. I am almost completely housebroken. I am great with other dogs and kids and everyone in general. Looking for a loving furever home that will feed me peanut butter. I don't know if you believe in love at first sight, but I will make you believe.",

            "description": "Meet Wallace! Poor Wallace was adopted from a metro area animal control and returned twice! Why, you ask? For being a puppy!! Sadly, being returned a second time was enough to have him labeled \"rescue only\", even though he never did anything wrong\n\nWallace is an energetic but super sweet and loving boy who is absolutely loving all of his new dog friends in his foster home. He doesn't totally understand all of the proper doggy etiquette yet though, so he definitely needs a dog friend who will both play hard and teach him manners. When he's not out playing with his friends, he loves being with his person catching up on all the affection he missed in his puppyhood. \n \n\nInterested in adding this goofy, fun loving boy to your pack?

            "description": "Meet Elvis! \n\nSiblings Elvis and Pru have had a rough few months! This duo of 2 year old Rat Terrier mixes were adopted from us as puppies. They had been found together in the countryside fending for themselves and theyve been together ever since! Sadly, their mom developed serious health issues earlier this year and has had to come to the heart wrenching realization that she can no longer provide them with the life they deserve. So a few days after Thanksgiving, Elvis and Pru said goodbye to their mom who loves them so very very much and moved back into their original foster home. Foster mom Arla had actually since stepped back from fostering but she had kept in touch with Elvis and Pru (she even pet sat for them a few months ago while their mom was in the hospital), so she didnt even miss a beat in saying she would absolutely take care of them and help ease the loss of their mom. Visibly sad and confused, Pru perked right up that first night when she saw Arla and realized where she was and who was there waiting for her!\n\nWe know how difficult it can be to find an extra special family willing to open their hearts and homes to two dogs at once, but Elvis and Pru have never spent a day apart and have already suffered enough loss in their lifetime. Its really important to us, and to their mom who loves them so very much, that they be allowed to stay together. If they cant have their mom, at least they can have each other. They are great with other dogs and actually find comfort in a pack, so to speak. So even though they have each other, we have determined that they do need at least one other dog in the home with them. They would also prefer a home without children - older teens are ok. We just know there is a special someone out there who needs these babies as much as Elvis and Pru need them. Is that special someone you?

            "description": "Meet Pru!\n\nSiblings Elvis and Pru have had a rough few months! This duo of 2 year old Rat Terrier mixes were adopted from us as puppies. They had been found together in the countryside fending for themselves and theyve been together ever since! Sadly, their mom developed serious health issues earlier this year and has had to come to the heart wrenching realization that she can no longer provide them with the life they deserve. So a few days after Thanksgiving, Elvis and Pru said goodbye to their mom who loves them so very very much and moved back into their original foster home. Foster mom Arla had actually since stepped back from fostering but she had kept in touch with Elvis and Pru (she even pet sat for them a few months ago while their mom was in the hospital), so she didnt even miss a beat in saying she would absolutely take care of them and help ease the loss of their mom. Visibly sad and confused, Pru perked right up that first night when she saw Arla and realized where she was and who was there waiting for her!\n\nWe know how difficult it can be to find an extra special family willing to open their hearts and homes to two dogs at once, but Elvis and Pru have never spent a day apart and have already suffered enough loss in their lifetime. Its really important to us, and to their mom who loves them so very much, that they be allowed to stay together. If they cant have their mom, at least they can have each other. They are great with other dogs and actually find comfort in a pack, so to speak. So even though they have each other, we have determined that they do need at least one other dog in the home with them. They would also prefer a home without children - older teens are ok. We just know there is a special someone out there who needs these babies as much as Elvis and Pru need them. Is that special someone you?

He tends to like to sprint and play rough, but that is hardly an issue since most other dogs like to play with him! He is friendly with all people he has met and we believe that he will do well with cats too.\n\nCall the Salmon Animal Shelter to ask about Roshi today!",

She is super sweet, smart and a very quick learner. She is full of kisses and is an absolute wiggle butt when being held as she wants to be put back down to run and play as soon as she can. With her fun and playful nature and her continuing socialization needs, we are only looking for homes with another dog-friendly dog and a fenced yard ... or an active family that will take her and her dog-sibling for walks. Also, because she is a young puppy that accidentally nips and scratches, we are looking for homes with children 10 and older. \n\nAs part of Pecan's $275 adoption fee, she will be spayed, microchipped, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, and current on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. If you have questions about this sweet little girl, you can email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Pecan, you can fill in an online application for her under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org.",

She just wants to play and be your best friend all day every day. She is dog (off leash) and kid friendly. She is working on her leash manners with other dogs as she gets extremely excited so an apartment with dogs on leash around would probably be too much. . She is not kitty friendly unfortunately. She is doing great with housetraining and she is crated trained as well. She is about 1 years old. She is up to date on vaccines, prevention, microchipped and started heartworm treatment that she can continue in her new home that will be provided by the rescue. She is also spayed. Her adoption fee is $175. Please fill out the application if you want to meet her: https://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=SGVJMGQY",

We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

He is housetrained and will signal to go out but should be on a schedule we first arriving in a new home. He is good with other dogs but is more of an observer as he is really shy. We think he will interact once he becomes comfortable as he came from a home with multiple dogs. \nHe is crate trained and will sleep in his crate or on his dog bed. He is a friendly guy but will need to to adjust to a new environment as he tends to be a bit cautious and slow to warm-up. He does like going for walks and is still learning how to be on leash as it is a new experience for him. Because he gets nervous he has a tendency to vomit when on a car ride. He doesn't have any formal training but is smart, young and a willing learner. He is not a chewer but likes to steal items to bring to his bed.\n\nHe is a pretty quiet dog but will bark when people come to the door.\nHe is respectful of cats and has not been around children at his foster's home so because he is shy, we are going to recommend children over the age of 8.\nHe is looking for a calm home with people willing to spend time with him and let him come out of his shell.\n\nWe are complying with all recommendations set forth by our governor. At this time our office is not open to the public and we will not be having public adoption events. We will continue to have private meet and greets ONLY.\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs we have available, please make sure to download an adoption application (from this site), fill it out, and email it to foothillcoordinator@gmail.com. We will be going over the applications for best fit for the dog, it is not first come first serve. If your application is chosen, we will set up a private meet and greet with you.

He is interested in cats but ignores them after he meets them. He is crate trained and will sleep in his crate but prefers to sleep with his human. Iron will mark in a new environment but does well with a belly band. He walks well on a leash and loves to go for walks but could use some training since he tends to pull when he sees other dogs. He only barks if there is a reason and knows how to use a doggie door. He will need guidance transitioning to a new home if it doesn't have a doggie door and should be on a schedule. He likes to ride in car and is a medium energy dog.\nIron does well with kids but does not like anyone directly in his face. Suggest he go into a home with older kids only.\nHe knows the name Tanner and will come to you when called\n\n\nWe are complying with all recommendations set forth by our governor. At this time our office is not open to the public and we will not be having public adoption events. We will continue to have private meet and greets ONLY.\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs we have available, please make sure to download an adoption application (from this site), fill it out, and email it to foothillcoordinator@gmail.com. We will be going over the applications for best fit for the dog, it is not first come first serve. If your application is chosen, we will set up a private meet and greet with you.

She was rescued at age two and is till very active. loves her walks but then enjoys snoozing on the couch. At 70 lbs. currently Zoey could stand to lose a few (like 10) pounds, but who can't? She is fully vetted, spayed and chipped and of course, housetrained,  Her owner said Zoey is ok with kids and cats (although she would chase them, so management would be key to harmony when mixing them), and had growled at other dogs, so placing her with a resident dog would have to be a matter of mutual acceptance. She is a beautiful girl  and should find her new home quickly.\n\nApproved applicants receive priority.\nApplications are being accepted:\nClick on the \"More About Us\" link to get to our Adoption Application\n\nEmail completed applications to: sandraschiller3008@gmail.com",

Frankie is very puppy-like and fun - he will play with any toy or eat any treat put in front of him.  He is sure to keep his forever family entertained and his tail is always wagging.  He is a friendly dog that seems to love everyone he meets and doesn't appear to have a mean bone in his body.  He is going to make a wonderful addition to a home. \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Winnie arrived here from Arkansas at the end of November with her one newborn puppy. Because Winnie was in mama mode and protective of her puppy, we have only just started to recently see her true personalitywhich is wonderful! Winnie is a large lap dog that would love nothing more that to lounge on a comfy bed or couch next to you. For the first month Winnie spent most of her time separate from the resident dogs and had a few negative run ins with our crabby, ten-year-old, ten lb. resident dog. Their \"fights\" looked and sounded worse that they were, and Winnie always seemed remorseful after. She is a sensitive girl and just wants to please you. She has recently started to play with the resident puppy. They love to run around the yard, wrestle and play tug-of-war. Winnie likes to use her paws to get your attention and does jump up. We are working with her on her manners. She also seems to have some separation anxiety and is very verbal and hyper when you get home. Winnie needs to have a harness on when walking. She is strong and is working on her leash manners. She is also a good jumper so a yard with a fence is needed. She does have some guarding with food and some toys. We feed her away from the other dogs. She seems to be getting better with this. Winnie would do best in a home with a well-mannered dog or as the only dog. We are not sure about cats. We don't know anything about Winnie prior to her arriving in Minnesota so she should go to a home without small children.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

He Is Very Easy To Redirect With A Patient Strong Leader When He Sees Other Dogs, However He Should Never Be Taken Off-Leash With Other Dogs Around As He Gets Reactive When Other Dogs Engage Him. He Needs An Owner Who Is Experienced With Shepherds. He Was Abused In The Past So His New Owner Needs To Be Patient And Assertive To Give Him The Confidence He Needs.",

She was spayed in December, after her last litter of puppies and she also went through heartworm treatment at that time as well- so she does need a nice calm lifestyle. She is crate trained about also starting obedience training as well! She is a very smart, loving gal! Her adoption fee is $225, which includes her spay, microchip, vaccinations, and HW treatment which we gave her.",

He\u2019s such a gentleman who loves hugs, kisses and everyone he meets. He is very playful and really enjoys having a dog companion so another dog and fenced yard are required. He is house and crate trained but we\u2019re still working on our basic commands! He\u2019s a smart boy who learns quick though. He\u2019s so great he even does good with kitties! He has no resource guarding issues and takes hints very well from other dogs. He would do best with an active family.\n\nPlease visit our website to view the process and fill out an application.

He is vision and hearing impaired due to the lack of care he received in his former life but that doesn't get in his way of getting around or letting you know when he wants attention- he will delight you with his soldier march and his VERY BIG ears and soulful looks.

We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to adoptioncenter@homewardtrails.org\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nMeet Daryl! This handsome male mixed breed comes to Homeward Trails from Fayette County, WV after he surrendered by his previous owner. He is a sweet boy, about 3 years old, looking for a family with lots of love and a little patience. He can be a little shy, but we know he's full of love and just adjusting to his new surroundings. Hopefully his forever home is soon to be! \n\nCome meet him this weekend at our adoption center.\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Center staff\nLocation: Adoption Center\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

            "description": "Duke is the PERFECT companion for someone who lives by themselves, or a small family looking for a dog who gives companionship! A huge cuddle bug, Duke loves spending time at his person's side. He does just fine being left in the home by himself, and behaves very well without being crated. He loves sleeping in a dog bed or in the bed with his human if they are welcome to it. Duke takes loyalty very seriously, and is devoted to his caretaker. While he is not dog reactive, he is not a fan of sharing the love and can sometimes be a bit competitive, so he would like do best as the only dog in a home, or paired with a calm, passive dog that does not ask for a lot of attention. He has not been tested with cats. \n\nDuke behaves rather well on walks, not reacting to other dogs or squirrels. He does, however, still get tangled in the leash so would do well with some training to help get him used to that. He is house-trained. \n\nDuke would pair well with a home of 1- 3 people who can give him a lot of attention and affection. We do not think Duke would enjoy a home with small children, so we are considering applications of families with kids 12+. \n\nPlease submit an application on our website, or email 'messagemarybeth@gmail.com' for more information. \n\nLocation: Foster \nAdoption Coordinator : Mary Beth Maggio \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

Please do not send inquiy \u201cis dog available \u201c\nThe 1st step is filling out an application at www.camorescue.com\nWe would love to help you find your next family member! \n\nRoss is a playful & sweet  8-9 yr old , 18lbs male Yorkie boy. He will unconditionally love his owner, and wants to be the center of attention! He loves to be by you, and will follow you around especially while he decompresses. He does great on his own while you are gone, and is fully potty trained. He may look fully blind, but he can still see shadows and picks up on queues very easily. He figured out the steps to the backyard the first time he went up them! He\u2019s very obedient, and just wants to be loved. He\u2019s not very fond of a kennel, but will sleep in a soft bed anywhere. Because of the situation he came from, Ross needs to be an only dog. \n\nIf Interested please fill out an application at www.camorescue.com\nCAMO Dog Rescue",

I have a sweet, but timid, personality- typical of hounds. I am house trained, so no middle of the night trips outside or accidents to clean up. I do well in my crate- I sleep in it with the door open.\n\nI am good with other dogs, but all I really want is to be with people more than anyone else, so I would be quite content as an only dog too. I CANNOT live in a home with cats- nope, not for me.  I haven't been around small kids, but I love my teenage foster sisters .My foster mom says I am doing fine on the leash, but I might still need some practice.\n\nOh and one more thing- I would LOVE a house where I am allowed on the couch- I do love to be cozy! I am so excited to have a furever home of my very own! If you think it might be with you, please apply!\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it.

A year ago Frida was saved by a rescue near a village in Skopje, Macedonia. She was emaciated and missing one of her front legs. After getting a vet care and good nutritional food, she soon became a very happy, joyful dog, playing and running with rescue kennel dogs. This 3 legged Miracle dog never lost her faith in humanity and doesn\u2019t let having 3 legs and a small heart murmur (treated by medication with no issue) to get in the way of anything. She is a happy girl, loves everyone, kids and dogs. Frida loves massages, running to play, walks, play with other dogs and she is also very calm and gentle dog. Her kindness, sweetness and full of joy makes her a very special dog. She gives so much love that you wouldn\u2019t think it is possible. \n\n This three legged angel is looking for her perfect forever home where they would love and care for her unconditionally.

Her infection has been cleared up and her incontinence is now controlled by medication which she will need to stay on.\n\nBear is a favorite among the volunteers.  She's very sweet but needs to learn not too pull on a leash.  She can be a little mouthy at times but is very gentle.  Bear has gotten along with the other dogs in the shelter.\n\nWe are currently accepting applications and making appointments to meet our adoptees.  You must have an appointment to be considered.  While you may adopt a dog prior to their spay/neuter appointment we do not allow them to go home until after surgery.\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, their vaccinations are current, they are treated for fleas and worms, and they have had a wellness check by our veterinarian.\n\nPlease call Nanette at 360-660-4661 or email nbpawsdogintake@gmail.com if you are interested. \n\nPlease LIKE us on Facebook at NORTH BEACH PAWS.\n\nPlease visit our website at northbeachpaws.org\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

She is beautiful to watch as she moves with a dancers fluidity.. she's calm, a serene observer.. she's snuggly and enjoys body contact.. if she likes you ( doesn't take much!) she moves into you and really enjoys being a team and sharing affection!! Grace has stolen Dog trainer Jamies heart.. huge inside tip!!\n\nShe's smart, cooperative and seems to really enjoy partnership. Sweet and incredibly friendly, Grace is a real people dog! She gets jazzed when meeting new people and will actually do flips in the air out of excitement!  She plays with toys all day and all night.. balls, rope toys, squeaker, nylabones.. you name is, Gracie girl will play with it! \n\nWe think Grace is a wonderful doggie who would do great in an active home with older children and no kitties.",

Her puppies have since been adopted, and now it is her turn! \nMarvel is very shy with new people, but in her foster home she is very sweet and cuddly with her foster mom.  She has been living with another small dog, cat and 2 young boys. Marvel is young and has energy to play and run, but also knows how to relax and be a couch potato.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Marvel please contact Amy via email at: s.chancerescue@gmail.com. \n\nOur dogs are all in volunteer foster homes, and we cannot guarantee attendance at weekly adoption events. Please let us know if you want to set up a meet and greet! \n\nWeekly adoption events are at Earth Pets Natural Market(500 NW 60th St, Gainesville, FL) on most Saturday's from 12:30-3:30pm!  \n\nFollow us on Facebook for most up to date information! https://www.facebook.com/pg/SecondChanceRescueRehoming",

He is pretty low maintainence and he is house trained :)  He is also crate trained and is good with other playful dogs but can be dominant so would probably be best as an only dog at first.  He is not a good candidate for small animals or cats.\n\nHe loves to for walks and play ball.  Come meet him anytime!\n\nRex is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative\n\nFor an application, email  alphadogrescue@gmail.com \nCall anytime:  603.781.8876",

That was Kodiak\u2019s existence before coming to Argos Rescue. \nKodiak is off the chain! \n\nHe\u2019s a sweetheart that loves other dogs, big and small. He\u2019s overjoyed to have toys to play with, already sits nicely when asked and wants to please.  Kodiak is a medium sized husky x boy ready for a new life. Lots of playtime, love, cuddles, and a basket full of toys !\n\nKodiak was diagnosed with heartworms and is currently going through treatment.  He is doing very well and once completed will have no negative affects from the heartworms or treatment.  Argos Rescue is responsible for the cost of treatment. \n \nIf you are interested in adopting Kodiak please fill out the adoption application found on our website under adopt.\nWww.argosdogrescue.org",

            "description": "Teddy is a 2 year old Male Schnoodle, weighing 14 pounds (The Schnoodle is a cross between a Miniature Schnauzer and a Poodle.)  Teddy was pulled by rescue from a high kill shelter where he was given an euthanasia date due to resource guarding his food bowl.  For this reason we are searching for an ADULT ONLY, QUIET home.  \n\nTeddy is doing well in his foster home with structure and routine.  Teddy has suffered physical abuse in his past and does not respond well to abusive/harsh discipline.  He does well with positive reinforcement training.  Teddy bonds quickly to his person and would like a home where his human spends a lot of time with him.  He is a true companion that follows his person wherever they go in the house.  Teddy is young and will need an active human to go on walks and play with.  He doesn't like to be left alone so a home where he will not be left alone for long hours of the day would be best.  ***Consider your time at home commitment AFTER covid-19 restrictions are lifted.  While working from home now, you will need to think about the time spent away from home after returning to work in the future.   Teddy likes dogs his size or smaller.  He is fearful of large dogs.  He will chase cats.  We would like Teddy to be the only pet in his new home where he will get all the focus and attention he is craving.  \n\n\nSchnoodles are charming, funny and smart, and their alert nature \u2014 thanks to that double dose of Schnauzer and Poodle attentiveness \u2014 makes them excellent watchdogs. They are small dogs and typically have a curly coat that MUST be groomed by a professional regularly, every 6-8 weeks.  \n\nA home with Schnoodle experience or Schnauzer experience is preferred. Schnauzer's can be temperamental so a person who is aware of their personality and loves them unconditionally would be great.\n\nTeddy's adoption fee is $300.00 which includes his neuter, current on vaccines including Rabies, de-wormed, Heart worm tested Negative, current on heart worm and flea prevention.  \n\nIf your home meets the requirements stated above and you want to meet Teddy, the first step is to complete an adoption application online at furgetmenotrescue.org   *In State of Ohio adoptions only.",

            "description": "Sadie is a 7 year old Boxer with a tail. Sadie is looking for a perfect home. She had a wonderful life until a little over a year old. Her mother was dealing with mental illness and committed suicide. The boyfriend tried to keep Sadie & the other dog but was not able. They ended up in animal control at least twice. We are not sure the outcome of the other dog. We were asked to take Sadie when she'd been in the shelter for 6 months. She was very skinny from intestinal worms. She was previously microchipped and spayed. She was also heartworm negative. \nWe instantly knew something was wrong. She has a slight head tilt. She also walks odd in the backend. We believe she was hit by a car at some point in her life. This doesn't affect her at all though. Her pupils do not constrict. It is called iris atrophy. She was diagnosed by an ophthalmologist vet. There is no treatment. She might have some sight defects but we rarely notice anything wrong. The vet noticed a few slight differences in her spine xray. She is on omeprazole 40 mg nightly. It reduces the fluid in the brain. I've noticed less of a head tilt since she's been on it. She saw a neurologist. The only way to absolutely diagnose would be an MRI. The issue is most problems are not treatable so it is a waste of money. The only thing we've noticed is she does not like loud noises. She really despises metal noises like a metal bowl hitting the floor or kennel. She does not like the noise a tag makes on the collar. She will need a tag that slips on the collar instead of a normal id tag. She had a dental with dental xray. She had 3 teeth pulled. She also had a lot of her gums removed. She has gingivitis hyperplasia. This is a genetic issue. Her parents shouldn't have been bred. It is very painful. She might need yearly dentals to correct this or it might never come back. It is something the owner must be able to afford if it returns. It is not something that can be ignored. We personally use Dr. Hill at Maple Small Animal Clinic in New Orleans, LA. He is great at dentals. She is up to date on her vaccinations, heartworm prevention and flea prevention. She is heartworm negative, microchipped and spayed. She had a negative fecal. She was treated for a urinary infection. She had a great exam recently. \nShe would prefer daily walks. She is a great snuggler and couch dog. But she does have some energy to burn. She does not like to be outside without you long. She wants to potty and come right inside. But if you are outside with her there are no issues. She loves to give kisses. She's great in the car. She's great on the leash. She is cat aggressive. She has no issues with the pigs. She has aggression issues with anything pit like. She obviously had issues in her past with a pit. She has no issues walking around dogs. She just cannot get super close to a dog that is pit like. She does love playing with dogs. I'd honestly prefer to have her in an only dog home. Her previous family taught her sit. She is crate trained and housetrained. She weighs 40 lbs. She will need to remain slender build to help her back. She is currently on Dasuquin for her joints. We also recommend Nutramax fish oil and adequan injections for her joints. \nShe is located in New Orleans, LA. Her adoption fee is $150.

            "description": "This is \u201cBear\u201d! Bear is 14 months old, male, full blooded German Shepard. He has been neutered, is house trained, up to date on all his shots and heart worm negative. He is a large dog that just wants to be your shadow- he will follow you everywhere and keep you company by contently laying at your feet if you are working from home. Bear does great on a leash and needs to be able to run off energy- either on lots of walks or in a yard. He is good with other dogs but we don\u2019t know about cats. He would do best in a home with preteens and above. This dog is amazing, gorgeous, and deserves a great home.\n\nThis dog is a Benefactor Dog. His/her increased adoption fee will allow them to act as a benefactor to other dogs in our care that require special medical care and a better chance at adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (that application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\n The adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale:\nBenefactor Puppies under 12 months - $500\nBenefactor Dogs over 12 months - $400\n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Cece is an adorable, affectionate Staffy mix who is 11 months old and weighs 40 lbs.  She came to BarkVille severely injured & requiring extensive surgery on her neck after being violently attacked by another dog.  She was found with another young female dog who was also scarred & injured, and we fear that both girls had been used as bait dogs. Thankfully, Cece's surgeries went well and she (and her companion) were both placed in wonderful foster homes where they are putting on weight & regaining their health & confidence daily.  Although her wounds have healed, CeCe will always need to wear a harness instead of a regular collar or slip lead due to the sensitivity around her neck.  Her foster mom says CeCe loves to nap all day and has started showing interest in durable chew toys, but will destroy stuffies.  She is a loving, gentle cuddle bug and is good with children.  She is housebroken, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  She is crate trained, but is not a fan of the crate, so she's looking for a home with a person/family who are home often so that her crate time will be minimal.\n\nFor more information about CeCe, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

He has a lot of energy and would make a great hiking companion, but he also enjoys time alone and knows how to entertain himself. Buster gets overexcited easily and becomes jumpy, especially when people are trying to put his harness on. He can also be reactive toward other dogs while he's on a leash. He has been working on staying calm during times of excitement, and he has developed a routine with his caregivers at Dogtown. Buster was born in 2017. He has some mild skin and respiratory issues, but they don't slow him down. He is very smart and will need a person or family who will continue helping him work on being calm. An active home where he can be the one and only, without other dogs or cats, would be ideal for him. Life is already exciting for Buster, but nothing would make him happier than finding a home to call his own.",

I do a great job listening while running, so I won't be tripping you up while we run :) ) \n\nI am looking for a home that can give me lots of walks and show me a stable environment. I can get a little nervous around new people, so I would like an owner that is good at seeing when I need attention and when I need to have my own space. I will be a fabulous sidekick to you!",

If you would like to try a Foster to Adopt trial, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nIf you are only interested in temporarily Fostering one of our rescues, please fill out a Foster Application.\n\nMeet Coffee!UPDATE 1-20-21: Here is what Coffee's foster mom has to say about him:'Coffee is so sweet and very playful. He enjoys his family time and focused attention with us, but also can play alone and entertain himself. He is almost completely crate trained and getting closer to being house trained (he still has the occasional pee accident). He is learning to sit and give paw and enjoys playing fetch and playing with his toys. He is both food motivated and toy motivated, and of course motivated by love and affection. He is also now leash trained and enjoys going for walks, he also does well on car rides. He enjoys children and has done well with our 3 children ages 3, 5, and 7, as well as our cat, and the neighbors dog.'ORIGINAL RESCUE STORY: Coffee was found on the streets of Ensenada Mexico and we are still learning about his personality. We will post more information about him as we learn more from his current foster family. We do know he is a typical young pup with lots of energy, which is the case with most pups his age. He is great with kids, dogs, and cats!\nBecause of COVID-19, sterilization appointments have been difficult to schedule. Coffee will both be sterilized on Thursday, January 28th in the 92109 area of San Diego. This means he can only be adopted to local families in the San Diego area to ensure they are able to take their newly adopted puppy to the pre-scheduled surgery appointment, and then pick him up at the end of the day after surgery.\nTherefore, please do NOT submit an application if you are not local to San Diego and able to attend the appointment shown above. If you would like to adopt and live outside of San Diego area, you are welcome to wait until his sterilization surgery has been completed to see if he is still available at that time.\nIf you are interested in adopting Coffee, please submit an online adoption application at www.arwob.org. Don't wait!\n\nIf you would like to meet one of our animals, PLEASE fill out an adoption application.\n\nDog Adoption Application\n\nCat Adoption Application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nIF YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY\nplease fill out a short questionnaire in addition to the adoption application.\n\nMilitary Questionnaire",

She is 8 weeks old . Moms pic is on here, she has very short legs like a Bassett and when we put her pic  in the breed finder it came with English bull dog and boxer, ppl ask me if there is pit, i love the pit breed but i go with the breed finder BUT there is always a possibility of pit mixed in and if that is a concern plz move on to another pup .  He is up to date on vaccines and his adoption fee is $380. His adoption fee includes his neuter surgery at 6 months or older \n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.  We do our best but many times we are wrong so please beware of this before rescuing from us.",

Tucker has the typical lab energy. He is not food aggressive and is very gentle when taking treats. He would do best with a family that is very active and willing to devote the time to continue to teach Tucker his basic skills. Tucker also loves to cuddle and is a good balance of energetic and calm. A big bonus is Tucker loves music, especially Fleetwood Mac, and does pretty good on long car rides.\n",

He is believed to be a Dane/Catahoula mix so not only is he large in size, he also has a good amount of energy to go with that size. Drake is a happy boy that loves hanging out with his canine friends. He is not a fan of the felines so a home without cats and other small animals is a must. Drake would do best in a moderately active family that has some large breed experience. Although he is goid with children we would recommend older kids due to his size. If you think you can give this smiley boy a home sweet home email us today",

She needs an adult home as she hasn\u2019t been around children in her young life.  She takes treats gently though, so it might be a possibility with older children, but a meet would be required.  Athena is currently Heartworm positive, so she must be kept calm and leash walked only during her treatment.

Unfortunately 5 of my 6 months of existence I was tied out on a chain in the backyard of my previous owners home. Not only was I never socialized often with people, I had no other puppy friends to play with . That was all until the folks at CARE of DC rescued me I can be slightly nervous and anxious upon initial meet, until I feel comfortable. I would be suited best with a new owner who is willing to take the time to give me some training, Attention and of course unconditional Love Quite honestly , I don't know what it is like to be a pup based upon never being socialized. If I sound like I may be a good fit and you are willing to give me a chance I will not disappoint you!",

Moms pic is on here, she has very short legs like a Bassett and when we put her pic  in the breed finder it came with English bull dog and boxer, ppl ask me if there is pit, i love the pit breed but i go with the breed finder BUT there is always a possibility of pit mixed in and if that is a concern plz move on to another pup .\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.

I'm not too good at it myself, so I'll be happiest in a home without other pets. But if you pick me you'll take home the handsomest dog in the shelter, if I do say so myself. I'd love for you to be my co-star, what do you say?\nTo adopt one of our animals, please visit our shelter, open Tuesday-Friday from Noon-6pm and Saturday from Noon-4pm. You may also submit an application online from our website at http://www.HelpTheAnimalsINC.com/adopt.",

He is around 8 weeks old and a very sweet little boy.  He is up to date on vaccines and his adoption fee is $380. His adoption fee includes his neuter surgery at 6 . Moms pic is on here, she has very short legs like a Bassett and when we put her pic  in the breed finder it came with English bull dog and boxer, ppl ask me if there is pit, i love the pit breed but i go with the breed finder BUT there is always a possibility of pit mixed in and if that is a concern plz move on to another pup . \n\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.  We do our best but many times we are wrong so please beware of this before rescuing from us.",

Her owners knew GRRR would find a great home that would foreve3r home who would give her what she needs to be a great, loving dog. \n\nLacee is a 5 years old golden doodle. She had been on medication, but now is med free. Her foster mom believes that she wasn\u2019t very socialized, as she gets very excited and will jump up. All of her behavior is correctable with your time and awesome training. Due to her jumping, it is recommended that she not be in a home with little kids, as she may inadvertently knock them right down. \n\nLacee is cheerful, loving and is just looking for a cuddle buddy-sofa or bed. She loves playing with toys and her foster home dog pack mates. Lacee is headed to a foster-to-adopt home this week. If she does become available for adoption, we'll list this on her page on our website at www.gr-rescue.org.\n\nTo adopt a Golden that you see here, please go to the Golden Retriever Rescue Resource website at www.gr-rescue.org  Read our adoption policies. If you qualify for this dogs adoption and the adoption policies, please write us for an adoption application at grrradoption@yahoo.com  Please provide your city and zip code. Please note, we only adopt to select areas within Ohio, Michigan and Indiana where we can do a home visit by a trusted volunteer. \n\nPlease read our adoption policies on our website prior to inquiring for an adoption application.

            "description": "\"A lap dog in her own mind.\" Sweet, sweet Cassie, no one wants to tell her she is not a lap dog. Cassie will follow you around, waiting for the opportunity to give you hugs and kisses. She is a Pyr who readily accepts belly and ear rubs. She longs to be close to you and likes to meet new people.\n\nCassie, born around March 2020 and weighing about 65 lbs, was rescued by the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society from a Texas animal shelter after her owner surrendered her. The family had to move and could not take her.\n\nCassie is house broken, crate trained, uses the pet door, walks nicely on a leash, and rides fine in a car. Her foster mom said, \"Cassie had no interest in the elderly cats and was tolerant after a slow introduction with the resident female canine. She can be very picky when meeting other dogs.\n\nCassie would thrive in an active family with older, considerate kids. She needs a yard to run and play in and daily walks. Cassie is an intelligent and treat-motivated Pyr who needs continuous training and socializing. She will require a confident leader in her family, familiar with Pyr behavior and traits. If you would like to adopt Cassie into your family, please complete an Adoption Application.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\n\tOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\tPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\tPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\tPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\tApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\tThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\nAdoption Fee $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

Tag and Tug are the best games ever! She would love to go to a home that has at least one other dog, and she also likes cats! She likes to play with happy young cats, and learned to ignore the old grouchy ones in one of her foster homes. Carly loves her chosen humans and shows it by staying near them all day long, napping next to them, \"talking\" to them about exciting things, and wanting to be part of all their activities.\n\nHowever, Carly is still very nervous around new people after coming from a place where she likely had little interaction with humans. She has come a long way, but is still learning that hands and petting aren't scary. Carly is working hard on her leash skills and basic obedience, but she has mastered targeting, coming when called, going to her place/mat, and has almost fully mastered potty training! Carly would do best with a patient family, with older or no kids, willing to continue her socialization training.\n\nGiven the slow transition Carly will need at home, she is a participant in our Foster-to-Adopt program and the lucky recipient of our post adoption scholarship! Her adopter(s) will be guided through the process of acclimating her to her new home, and will receive donated training from K9 Wisdom post-adoption.

More details below.\n\n**During the current health situation**\n\nIf you are interested in ADOPTING from the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, please email the shelter manager, Becky Snyder at rsnyder@edisonnj.org and she will send you an application to fill out and discuss potentially setting up a meeting. The subject of the email should be \"Adoption - Pet's Name\". Thank you. Be safe and stay healthy.\n\nADOPT ME!  Say hello to SCOOBY. He is a gorgeous SWEETHEART who is about 2 years old. He is fun, playful and very, very energetic. \n\nScooby needs a home with a fenced yard and someone willing to take the time to give him the attention and training he so desperately needs. He is not the dog for you if you live in an apartment or condo without a yard that he can run in. He likes to be with people, so just putting him out in a yard alone will not work. He will just sit and wait for you to come out and play with him. With the training he needs, it may be best if he is the only dog so he could focus.\n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nFor our shelter updates, check out Friends of the Edison Animal Shelter Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/edisonanimalshelter\n\nTo view all of the Edison Animal Shelter's available pets on Petfinder (which includes pictures and bios), please click on the following link: https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=NJ593\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/edisonshelter/?igshid=1b8ab04w24mb6",

She can be a bit shy at first, but give her a little time and she will open her heart to you showing you what a wonderful dog she is. She likes her walks, playing fetch and adoring you. She will be happiest in a home as the only dog or with a mellow male who just wants to hang around and take naps in the sunshine. She needs a home free of cats and small dogs. Olette is a smart cookie who craves a mental challenge to keep her sharp and on her toes. She has that fun boxer personality and is so happy to run and play hard only to crash hard at the end of the day. Olette will be your best friend for many years to come! (Weight: 58 pounds.)\n*If you are interested in adopting Olette please call the shelter (509 662-9577) to set up an appointment to meet her.",

She is shy and would be best with experienced adult adopters. Once she gets to know you, she'll follow you from room to room just to be by your side. She is energetic and spins in circles for a treat or attention and goes into her crate when told it's bedtime. She is house trained. She learned the doggie door within one hour. She's good with cats and all dogs. If you are interested in Miss Fiona, fill out an application for her and then we can set up a meet and greet.",

I really enjoy playing ball, and chewing on kongs. I love people, and like to climb into a friendly lap and might even give a few kisses! Because I'm a herding breed, when I'm excited I may even try to herd my favorite people. I would love a home where my owners help me get lots of exercise! I am very high energy and love to run around. I would probably enjoy trying agility, especially because I'm such a good jumper! I can jump REALLY high. I do keep my kennel clean though, and I can be patient and quiet when it's not my turn to go outside. I can't wait to find my new home! \n\nTo find out more about me you can fill out a pre-adoption survey on our website, then email it to us. Then, call (816) 325-7207 and ask to make an appointment for a digital meeting! I can't wait to meet you!\n\nhttps://www.ci.independence.mo.us/AnimalServices/AdoptableAnimals",

I\u2019m very good about taking those yummy treats from you gently and will quickly sit when I see one in your hand!  Here at the shelter, I like to run and explore the yard when outside but am pretty laid back when I get to come in a hang out with the staff.\n\nI came to the shelter with my 2 girls and we\u2019ve had fun here but we\u2019re all ready to move on to our forever homes.  I have more of an alpha personality so if my new home has other furry friends, I\u2019d love to meet them first to be sure  we\u2019d make a good match. As for kitties,  I\u2019m a little curious when they walk by and but I get scared when they hiss & swipe at me.  The shelter staff would be happy to reintroduce me to one if you\u2019d like to add me to your cat-friendly home to see if I\u2019d be a good match for your family.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to meet my new family!

            "description": "Ralphie is young (about 1 year old) pointer mix that will be joining us in Maine January 30th. He was hit by a car in Louisiana and had to have FHO surgery to keep the leg. He does have a limp when he walks that will be permanent. \n\nEven with his injury this does not slow down Ralphie. He is energetic and loves everyone. He gets along with other energetic dogs but does not do well with cats...he will chase them. \n\nHe loves to go for walks and does well on a leash. He is crate-trained and mostly housebroken. \n\nRalphie would do best in a home without cats or small children. He gets along with most dogs but with his energy older dogs may not appreciate. He would love someone that could give him a home with some hiking or swimming. He would also love a good massage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n",

            "description": "Hi I'm Josie. I'm a happy pup but I can also be a bundle of nerves at times when I'm around a lot of people or commotion. I get along with most people and other dogs if there isn't too much happening at once. I would do best with children closer to their teens as children may be a bit too rambunctious for me. Because I get a tad nervous with noises and meeting new people and I like to talk, I'm probably not cut out for apartment-living. I need to meet all family members and dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Josie will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Josie 1365770 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

Limburger is VERY treat motivated which makes it easy for him to learn new tricks! Recently he learned how to play dead with a cowboy hat on and it is the cutest thing! He is a friendly and lovable dog! He will moan and groan if he is not the one getting affection and will completely melt once you begin to pet him. He loves belly rubs and getting his hair brushed. One of Limburger's favorite things to do is to destroy stuffed animals! He gets the biggest kick out of taking the squeaky toy out and is very proud when he does! This big boy loves to play! He will run away with our shoes just to get a reaction out of us and we have to negotiate for them back. He has never destroyed anything, he is just very playful! A very big plus is that Limburger is house and crate trained! He is like clockwork so we never have to worry about any accidents inside the home. I weigh approximately 75 lbs.

            "description": "Nipper is a two-year old, 9 lb, male Chihuahua that came to us as a stray no one ever claimed. He is a very bouncy, active and playful boy. He is nicknamed Nipper as he is very mouthy and has a tendency to jump and grab your fingers with his teeth and why we have no children on him. He isn't doing that to be mean but some folks won't like that at all and he does need to learn a bit better manners. NOT housetrained and NOT good with other male dogs.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "PHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

            "description": "PHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

I am just the opposite. Im Vlad, the Lover of People and Mighty Good Dog. Come meet me and find out yourself! Ive been around long enough 8 hooman years -- to know what peeple want from me. I am easy to walk, gentle and laid back. A shelter hooman said I am a love-bug. I even Sit for treats! I love kiddy pools, peeple petting me, and get this! BATHS! Baths feel so good, and hoomans give me lots of rubs and pets when they scrub-a-dub me. The shelter checks to see how us dogs are with peeple, food, toys, handling like a vet does, and other dogs. I did great in four out of five! This Vlad is a lover of peeple, not a lover of other dogs. I will love you so much that you wont need to share your love with any other pet. Ill greet you so happily that youll find excuses to leave home for a few minutes just so you can rush back home to my love. A crate would help me have a good start when you take me home. Its a good place for me to sleep, eat, and get treats and toys. It would be my safe place for me to blend in to my new home gradually and happily. I might have to be slowly trained to the crate, but it will help us all, a lot! Thanks for checking me out on the Internet. Now check me out in person! Fill out the adoption form. It just gathers all the information in advance for adoption to go smoother, it doesnt commit you. (I wish it did!) Ask to meet Vlad! Ill be waiting to love on you.",

            "description": "\nReina 34127: Meet Reina! Reina is an energetic 2 year old female Pit Bull in search of an active forever family. Reina has an exuberant personality and is always ready for a play session in the yard. In her previous home, Reina was housebroken and crate trained. She never lived with another dog or a cat, so we do not know how she will do at this time with other pets in the home. She lived with older children and enjoyed playing with them. Unfortunately, Reina\u2019s family had to downsize and the new home would have been too small for Reina. Her new forever family must met certain requirements in order to adopt Reina. You must own your home, have a fenced in yard, and commit to taking Reina to obedience classes once adopted. Since Reina is still working on her manners, she will benefit tremendously from the obedience training.

I have a LOT of energy and love to play so a nice big fenced yard would be awesome so I could romp with the kids and family.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "Benjey ACCT-A-82369\n\nIntake Type: Owner Surrender (Aggression to Animals)\nSex: Male\nAltered: No\nAge: 5Y\n\nMedical Observation:\n(1/9) Normal. Mild tartar. Friendly; BAR\n\nBehavior Observation:\n(1/18) Per Foster Staff --\nKennel Presentation - Easy to leash/social. Shy but approaches kennel door and allows leashing. On return, hesitant to re-enter but will go in with a bit of encouragement, or if handler steps in first.\nLeash Skills - Pulls Minimally On Leash. Walks excellently on leash with almost no pulling at all. We encountered another dog through the fence. Benjey perked his ears up and raised his tail, then trotted over to the other dog and sniffed him through the fence with tail flagging. It was very easy to redirect his attention just by calling his name, and he did not fixate on the other dog.\nHandleability - Tense/Allows all handling. Was initially quite tense and took time to warm up. He was tense outside while in the run, but once he came into indoor eval room he loosened up and allowed allover handling. Eventually he began soliciting attention, licking my hand and giving kisses. He would place his head on handler's lap, lean up against handler and lay down right next to handler. He takes his time warming up, but then allows all handling and gets cuddly and affectionate. Go slow at first until he is ready.\nTag - Engages in play\nToys - Gives up willingly. Initially had Benjey in a run outside, where he was not interested in toys. He appeared tense and nervous outside and would flinch or tense up at any loud sounds or cars passing. Went into the indoor eval room, where he was still tense at first, but once he found a tennis ball he became very excited and happy, started wagging his tail and jumping around with the ball. He would drop the ball at the handler's feet and allow handler to pick it up without issue, no resource guarding observed. Very playful!\nEvaluated Blue due to nervousness, but hand-shyness has improved considerably and overall behavior is much better.\n(1/12) Per Foster Staff -- \nKennel Presentation - Nervous. Nervous in kennel. Would approach handler to take treats from hand but ran away from leash. Took many attempts to successfully leash him. Once leashed, exited kennel easily. Also re-entered without issue, but then would not approach kennel door so I could remove leash. \nLeash Skills - Fearful. No pulling, but afraid of leash.\nHandleability - Tense and nervous, would initially duck or move away when attempted handling. Avoidant of handler and only approached a few times for drive-by sniffs. Later approached me with some low tail wags and allowed some pets on his back, but appeared wary and whale-eyed me so handled very minimally.\nDid not attempt tag. Interested in toys but does not take possession. Followed a ball when tossed. \nEvaluated Blue, recommend TTA.\n(1/11) Per Foster Staff -- Attempted to remove for evaluation. Benjey would tentatively approach me to take treats but was scared of the leash and would run to the other side of the kennel any time I tried to leash him. No aggression shown, just nervous of people and afraid of leash. Will reattempt eval later today.\n(1/9) Per Previous Owner -- Protects his home, obeys most of the time but can become territorial when people come to the house such as barking and trying to jump on them. He also wont allow other dogs to eat and move their bowls. He stalks around the other animals in the home and won't let them play or move around. Has been biting the other dogs in the home, usually he will stop when owner approaches and directs him to do so. Walks very nicely on leash next to his handler. Knows sit, get down, and go pee. He is a good dog but just needs the right environment without another male dog.\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. This animal is not onsite. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact foster@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster. \n\nWe encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for your visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more! \n\nIs this your missing pet?

He would do great with a younger dog that liked to play.  He has a joyful, happy, spirit.  He would make a good companion for an active family.  He would love to go on hikes and camping.  He does not like cats though and possibly should start with older kids. \n\nD.O.B. is 11-24-19.\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Green Go Getter!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

No kids. No apartments. \nSpecial Info: Likes to play ball! Will do best as a one or two-person dog. Rigby would really benefit from work with a force-free trainer (one session included with adoption).\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely.

If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day.

The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

She would do best in a home with NO CHILDREN and NO PET'S.\n\nMeet GABBANA our cute ROTTWEILER with the BIG SMILE! More details below. \n\n**During the current health situation**\n\nIf you are interested in ADOPTING from the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, please email the shelter manager, Becky Snyder at rsnyder@edisonnj.org and she will send you an application to fill out and discuss potentially setting up a meeting. The subject of the email should be \"Adoption - Pet's Name\". Thank you. Be safe and stay healthy.\n\nADOPT ME!  Say hello to GABBANA who is 8 years old.  So far, she seems to be easy to walk on a leash and housebroken. She likes taking a bath and loves to play ball.  She seems to be tolerant of other dogs and everyone, but we feel she would do best with no children and no other pets in the home. \n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please visit us at the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, 125 Municipal Blvd., Edison, NJ 08817.  Our phone number is 732-248-7278.\n \nPublic Hours: We are open 7 days a week from 12pm-4pm.\n\nFor our shelter updates, check out Friends of the Edison Animal Shelter Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/edisonanimalshelter\n\nTo view all of the Edison Animal Shelter's available pets on Petfinder (which includes pictures and bios), please click on the following link: https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=NJ593\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/edisonshelter/?igshid=1b8ab04w24mb6",

His harness had dug into his skin, leaving deep wounds, but he was so happy to see us!\n\nCruz is a good boy who loves your company! He is a sweet and deserving dog, who enjoys yard time, and snuggles. \n\nHe is a bigger dog, likely an American Bulldog mix with some hound. \n\nCruz is potty trained. He is not a good fit for a household with young children - but older kids should not be a problem. \n\nCruz is a romantic dog who wants to show a lot of affection. He does not have any problems with house guests, and can enjoy a busy household.\n\nIncluded in the adoption fee of $275 is utd vet care, dewormwr vaccines, microchip, and his neuter surgery at our vet, post adoption. \n\nApply here for Cruz: rebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt",

            "description": "Snapshot of Eloise!\n\nSize?\nFull size (35-50lbs)\n\nAge? 9\nmonths\n\nActivity Level?\nI play hard and snuggle hard!\n\nNoise Level?\nI like to alert people that something is happening, but I quiet down quickly!\n\nGood with Dogs?\nI'm great with slow intros!\n\nGood with Cats?\nUntested, but likely fine!\n\nGood with Kids?\nI love little ones!\n\nGood with Strangers?\nI love everyone!\n\nPotty Trained?\nI'm working on it!\n\nCrate Trained?\nI do well without one, but I like to hangout in it every once in a while.\n\nInterested? Learn more about Eloise below!\n\nAbout Eloise:\n\nHi! My name is Eloise! I am approximately 9 months old. I have been living with my foster dad and his three young kids who are all under the age of 10. So with that being said, I love kids! I have a lot of energy so I like that these young kids can keep up and play with me! I love to play fetch with a tennis ball. My favorite toys are ones that squeak! I'm interested in other dogs when I see them but still cautious about meeting them. I don't have any experience with cats so I'm not sure how I will handle them.\n\nI am a good listener and already know how to sit for my treats. I'm doing very well with my potty training. I will stand by the door to let you know that I need to go outside.\n\nI am also extremely excited to see you when you walk in the door. My tail will be going in circles and I can't wait to fill your face with kisses! If you're feeling like you just want to relax and put your feet up, then I am more than happy to cuddle up next to you and have you pet me. I will lay next to you for hours if you rub my belly!\n\nAdoption Fee: $550\n\nTraining Requirement: Obedience Level 1 Training\n\n*Foster to Adopt: I am looking for a forever home now, but I still need all my puppy shots and to be spayed! So I'm looking for a family that will be able to commit to bringing me to all of my appointments with TCPR until I'm ready to be fully adopted by you!\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization. We can only rescue as many animals as available foster homes. Please consider saving the life of an animal in need and become a volunteer foster home today. To become a foster, fill out a dog or cat foster application on the Twin Cities Pet Rescue website: www.twincitiespetrescue.org . There is little to no cost to foster an animal. Twin Cities Pet Rescue provides its foster families with food, supplies, and veterinary care for its animals. All you need to do is supply the love!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Twin Cities Pet Rescue does not adopt to homes further than 60 miles from the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metro Area.",

Due to some of Gracie's puppy behaviors, she would best be suited for a family without children. Due to her vocal nature she may be better suited for a house than an apartment. \n\nGracie gets overstimulated when interacting with people and gets very mouthy and grabby with hands and clothing. She will need an owner that has dog training experience and can give her consistent positive reinforcement training. \n\nShe absolutely adores other dogs, but can be overwhelming for most dogs. She will need a very high energy playmate that can wrestle for hours if she gets placed with another dog.\n\nWe always recommend crate training, exercise, playtime, and a regular schedule for potty breaks when bringing a new dog into your home. The shelter environment is much different than your home, so expect the unexpected. We do our best to help find the right pet for you, but your new dog may act differently on your turf than he/she did on ours.  Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient and enjoy this new and exciting time!\n\nIncluded in the adoption fee are rabies (if applicable) & distemper vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, spay or neuter surgery.\n",

            "description": "If you think Ellie looks adorable in her pictures, just wait until you meet her in person!  Ellie is a 1 year old 18lb Glen of Imaal Terrier/Terrier mix who has it all - she is just the right combination of beauty and brains rolled up in one playful package. This kind and affectionate girl loves engaging with her people, whether it involves being active outside or relaxing on the couch, and relishes tummy rubs and nuzzling. She is a timid girl and needs a quiet home that will help her continue to build her confidence.\n\nEllie is house and crate trained, and knows her basic commands. She is highly motivated and eager to please and very, very smart. Ellie will thrive with obedience training and should easily progress to learning advanced behaviors. Her foster family tells us that she is playful with other dogs but loves attention from her people and would be fine as the only dog in the family. This sweetie has a limitless amount of love to give and will be a wonderful addition to an extremely lucky home.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Meet Leah Anglin who is an approximate 6 year year old mixed breed.  Leah came from a wonderful home whose mom passed away unexpectedly. Leah's mom had just adopted Leah in 10/2020.  Leah has been socialized and was going to doggy daycare several days a week with Transform My Dog.  Leah knows the basic commands but gets so excited when she first meets you. She is super sweet and loves nothing more than to have her ears rubbed.  Leah is quite active and loves to run and play with other dogs her size.  She does need work on her leash manners. Due to her energy we recommend children be 8 years or older. Leah will chase cats so we recommend a no cat family.  Leah would be great for an active couple who like to walk, hike, and have their dog involved in their activities.  Leah will bolt out the door and her mom was working on these issues when she passed away. Leah is spayed, current on vaccines, and heartworm negative.  Leah is a love bug. Leah was a work in progress, could you be that family to finish Leah's work?\n\nPlease note GDRST is an all-volunteer, run by individuals with full time careers. In order to meet with a Dane that you are interested in,you will need to complete an application. After receiving your application, a volunteer will verify with your vet the care on your current or previous animals and then contact you to set up a home eval and to discuss which Dane may be a match for you.\n\nGreat Dane Rescue of Southeast Texas \n16516 El Camino Real #402 \nHouston, TX 77062-5723 \n\nInformation E-mail: info@saveadane.org \n\nAdoption E-mail: adoption@saveadane.org \n\nWebsite www.saveadane.org\n\nConnecting Great Danes to Great People \n\nGreat Dane Rescue of Southeast Texas",

While here, we are noticing that Echo is very shy to meeting new people, often hiding on the backside of his kennel if staff enter. Some patience and a calm voice help him approach you and accept head pets. Once outside, he wants to show you how fast you can zoom and how much of an active buddy he can be. He seems to be food possessive here at the shelter though, so a home without children to help him overcome this fear would be best for him. With a little patience, love, and consistent feeding schedule, Echo will warm up and be the adventure companion you are looking for. If you are interested in meeting Echo, please fill out an application at www.highsierraanimalrescue.org. We do not discuss potential adoptions without an already submitted application.\n\nEcho is set to get neutered on 1/12. He can be met before that date, but cannot go home until after his surgery.",

            "description": "Wilbur is a five year young beagle mix. He has longer legs and a longer snout, so we are guessing he has another hound dog mixed in there somewhere.  Don't let his looks fool you! He has greyed a bit early, probably because he had a rough life prior to rescue. We just tell him it means he's a distinguished gentleman! You see, he spent his whole life in a small little pen 24/7. Thank goodness, he was saved by animal control who knew he was not living the life he deserved. He was rescued along with his next door neighbor, a petite little beagle living in a pen next to him. Despite his less than ideal past, Wilbur has thrived in his foster home. He is a very loving boy to other dogs and every one that he meets. Don't let the grey hair fool ya, he still has plenty of giddy up and go in him! It's like he is making up for lost time. He is the perfect balance of playful and calm, not too much of either one. Wilbur loves to wrestle with his foster brother (who happens to be a young beagle), and then is also equally happy to settle down for a nap on the doggie bed. Besides playing with his foster brother, he loves to run around the back yard, nose to the ground, and talking up a storm!! It's as if he is just telling the whole world how happy he is to be free. Because of his \"big hound dog voice\", Wilbur is not suited for apartment life. He needs a big, fenced in yard to stretch his legs, and practice his \"snout to the ground, shout it out loud\" game. Wilbur is crate trained, house trained, and knows how to use a doggie door. He doesn't try to get on the furniture, but loves to curl up on the dog bed while you are watching T.V. or just hanging out. Wilbur would do best in a home with another dog that he could play and spend time with, and gets lonely (and vocal) without a buddy to hang out with. He can hardly wait to have his own home sweet home.",

I am potty trained but I\u2019m not a huge fan of being outside unless someone is with me so reminders to go outside and positive encouragement are always appreciated!!\n\nDo you have room on your couch and in your heart for my this tiny little Mouse?!\n\nAdoption fee: $350\n\n\nFor an application to adopt this pet, please visit our website! www.heavenafterhellrescue.org \nOnce approved to adopt, the adoption fee can be paid in cash or check.\n \nAdoption includes:\n \nSpay or neuter\nHeartworm test\nAge appropriate vaccines\nRabies\nBordetella\nAge appropriate wormer\nFlea Preventative\nHeartworm preventative\nMicrochip w/registration\n \nWe cannot hold animals more than 7 days after we receive a deposit as we don't want them to miss out on a forever home.\nAdopters are required to come to us to meet the pets.

Please give us a call if you questions about a pet or complete an application at https://adoptmountainpets.org/pet-services/adoption-process/application-form to make arrangements to visit the Animal Resource Center.\n\n\nHi all, I'm Mesa! I came to Second Chance almost 3 months ago! I was raising my puppies but since they have all found forever homes I'm looking for my own! I get along well with other dogs but I do not like cats! I will do best in a new home with another playful confident dog.  \nI am reserved lady at first and sometimes and scared of strangers.  I am hoping to find someone who can be patient with me as I learn to enjoy the world of cars, strangers, and new places.  \nhowever, I have a heart of gold and will be loyal to end with the right BBF. \n\n\nI would do best in an active home as I have a lot of energy.

I\u2019m only 11 mos old. \n\nI respond to monkey (Korean translation) which is a very accurate description of my personality. I am highly active and very playful. I bounce and run around full of excitement. What can I say, things make me happy...so happy that you\u2019d think I\u2019m listening to let\u2019s get it on because I have been known to get humpy, lol... It\u2019s one of my funny quirks. A few interjections and guidance from my humans let me know NO to the humpty hump. \n\nI love my toys and bones they\u2019re the best as I love chewing on things, if you throw it I will go get it. I am a puppy at under 1 yea, so how can you blame me??  I\u2019ll make a great dog park playmate if you\u2019ve got a good arm. I need big boy toys that I can\u2019t destroy, unless you don\u2019t mind picking up my trail of toys that explode. ?\n\nMy manners need to be worked on. I know sit especially if you have food or a toy in your hand. I could use some help understanding how to direct my energy and learn new commands, so a family who is fully prepared to help me get therewith patience and love is a necessity. \n\nI\u2019m soooo happy about everything I do, so when you say, \u201cno\u201dI might not get that what I did was wrong at first. I came from Korea theres a lot  to learn. I\u2019m just a happy loving pup who is good with other dogs. I also need to be fed separately.  Since  I have been so deprived of food, I get very excited and don\u2019t like to share. I think in time I will overcome this concern ??\n\nI\u2019m a smart boy, I\u2019m great with a bathroom routine. I\u2019ll instantly go when you let me out and let you know when I want back in by pawing at your door in excitement.  I have had a few accidents inside since coming to America so my forever family must be committed to my potty training. \n?\nI know that with the right active family who might even have a furry playmate for me and that will take the time to help me adapt and learn new things, I will shine and make an amazing forever pet. \n\nSo if your looking for a new addition, fill out an application online so we can meet!! ????????\n\nhttps://www.vegaspetrescueproject.com/dog-adoption-interest-form",

            "description": "Ahhh, what to say about RANDY? Home Fur Good loves this guy, and we know his perfect family is out there that will love him just the way he is. And the way Randy \"is,\"... is a bit special! ;-) Randy has had a few failed adoptions thus far, but we all know you don't often find true love on the first try. Randy has spent quite a bit of time with our trainer, who has helped us gain some more insight into his personality. \n\nTo start, Randy is a FUN guy! He clearly has a talent for doggy modelling, and would love a forever home that takes lots and lots of pictures of his handsome face. Randy is always willing to pose with his \"sit\" and \"paw\" tricks, and will happily show them off for some treats. Randy has the perfect moderate energy level. Sometimes he enjoys a good run around the yard with a toy, and sometimes he's happy to curl up on a bed and chill out with a chew bone. Randy is affectionate with those he knows (he loves a good back scratch), but also independent enough to sniff around and explore on his own. In fact, Randy has quite the independent streak to him, which is part of what has made finding his perfect forever fit a bit of a challenge. Per Home Fur Good's trainer, Randy has quite a stubborn streak to him, and will do best in a home that sets boundaries while still allowing Randy to be Randy. He does not enjoy being \"forced\" to do things, and does not respond well to \"discipline-based\" dog training. Randy will do best in a home that loves him just the way he is, and is willing to get to know Randy on his terms. Randy will also do best in a home with no small children, and no other animals. \n\nWe KNOW Randy's perfect person is out there waiting for him... could that person be YOU? Randy is listed at three years old and weighs 52 pounds. Randy is currently in board and train with Home Fur Good's trainer in Phx. Call 602-971-1334 and we will get you in touch with Randy's trainer for a meet and greet. Randy's adoption fee is $150 and includes prior training, spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital. Our adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday from 11:00 am-4:00 pm by appointment only.",

            "description": "Reina 34127: Meet Reina! Reina is an energetic 2 year old female Pit Bull in search of an active forever family. Reina has an exuberant personality and is always ready for a play session in the yard. In her previous home, Reina was housebroken and crate trained. She never lived with another dog or a cat, so we do not know how she will do at this time with other pets in the home. She lived with older children and enjoyed playing with them. Unfortunately, Reina's family had to downsize and the new home would have been too small for Reina. Her new forever family must met certain requirements in order to adopt Reina. You must own your home, have a fenced in yard, and commit to taking Reina to obedience classes once adopted. Since Reina is still working on her manners, she will benefit tremendously from the obedience training. Please call the shelter to discuss the adoption process, and to schedule an appointment to meet Reina.\n*Our shelter is now open by appointment only. If you are serious about adopting this pet, please call us at 410-313-2780 ext. 0 to schedule an appointment. Appointments are scheduled during our animal viewing hours:\nMon, Wed, Thur, Fri 10:00-4:30\nTues 1:30-7:00\nWe are currently closed on Saturdays and Sundays.*",

I am a high energy fella that would benefit from a big yard and an active family that can keep me entertained. My previous owners did not expect me to be this big so I am searching for a new home, they did say however that I was potty trained in the home, good on car rides, and like to keep myself busy with KONG toys :) But even though I have a love for chewing toys, I do like to chew other things as well when I'm not in my crate. I absolutely need lots of obedience training and some behavioral modification to help me learn not to destroy the things around me. Sometimes, I will even chew the people around me! Not to hurt them but I just love to CHEW! I do need a bit of leash training as well, as I don't realize my own strength and size. Otherwise, I am a big lover boy that loves to give HUGS and would do great with some older kids that can be aware of my shortcomings and help me to learn the right way to do things!",

            "description": "This adorable duo is officially in search of their forever home. Chico and Rico are a pair of bonded chihuahuas and looking for a home together. While we don't know their entire background, we do know that they were found wandering the streets of Texas together. Both boys were rescued and found to be heartworm positive. After undergoing treatment, they made the long trek north in search of a loving home. \n\nRico is 2 years old and weighs 10lbs. He is very outgoing and friendly. He enjoys playing, snuggling and giving lots of kisses. He loves his crate and is almost completely potty trained to go outside, although he is still working on it and has the occasional accident indoors. \n\nChico is 2 years old and weighs 5lbs. He is a little more timid, but once he warms up he loves a good snuggle session and giving lots of kisses. He likes his kennel and is trained to use potty pads. He will go outside to go potty as well, but has not yet adjusted to the cold Wisconsin winter. Chico tends to be more nervous and prefers a calm and quiet atmosphere so a home with no small children would be best. \nChico and Rico are adjusting well to living indoors but will need patience while they continue to adjust to the chilly weather in Wisconsin. If you are looking for someone to keep you warm on those long, cold winter nights, then these little lap warmers just might be the perfect match for you!\n\n\nIf you are already pre-approved or have any questions about Chico and Rico please email our adoptions team at misfitmuttsdogrescue@gmail.com. If you are interested in adopting this bonded pair please head over to misfitmuttsdogrescue.com and fill out an adoption application. \n\n\n",

Phone interviews do not take place til after an approved application is on file.\n\nEligible for the Golden Paws Program (adoptors 60 yrs and older adopting a dog 7 yrs and older get $50 off the adoption fee noted below)\n\nMy name is Molly. I am a 9 year old CORGI MIX (no boston in me, sorry) and weigh 27 pounds. I need a new home because my owner needs surgery and can't take care of me no longer.  I am being fostered in Des Moines, IA.\n \nI love squeaky toys\nI have lots of energy.  I need playtime and walks.\nI would rather not any other pets in my home. I have a history of starting fights.\nI need tummy rubs, kisses and lots of treats.\nI enjoy the humans in the house, pets from them and being able to do tricks for them but not much of a cuddle bug..  I do not always want to sleep in bed with my humans.\n\nRemember that age is just a number. I act like a puppy.  I can self entertain when needed.  I love to run around the fence line and chase squirrels but also relax watching through the window.\n \nHere's a little more about me:\nHousetrained?  Yes\nLeash-trained?  Yes\nRides well in car?  Yes, love!!!\nGood with other dogs? No, I lived with other dogs and not a fan. I would be the one to start the fights.\nGood with cats? No\nGood with young children? Prefer a low active household so no young children.\nGood with strangers?  Yes but need time to trust especially with men but I will come around\nShy or confident?  confident\nBarks?  at squirrels\nApartment qualified?  No, I want a fenced in yard to run in\nAny Special needs or Health Issues?  None\nAdoption fee: $125\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered (if six months and older), up to date on rabies and distemper, heartworm tested, and microchipped. Other medical needs diagnosed while in foster care are also treated prior to adoption.\n\nMABTR requires a fenced in area from families who own their home, however we DO adopt to apartment complexes and communities where fences are not permitted due to leases and covenants. In these cases a leash law must be enforced.  We do not accept invisible fencing.\n\nMABTR only adopts to families residing in NE, CO, MO, KS, IA, WY, SD, ND, ID, UT, MT, MN, and SW corner of AR due to the lack of volunteer support in other states, no exception even if you are willing to drive.\n\nIf you are Interested in Adoption please complete our online adoption application at https://www.adoptaboston.com/adopt/application/. Petfinder's form is NOT our application.  We will respond back to you within 72 hours of receiving your application.\n\nInterested in Donating visit https://www.adoptaboston.com/help/",

This Sweet girl is 3 or 4 years old and weighs 35 pounds. She is very smart and so Happy. She knows how to sit and she likes to go for walks but she does pull on the leash. Cassie is good with other dogs but we aren't sure how she is with cats, she would probably chase them because she does like to chase squirrels. She was picked up as a stray and went unclaimed. Cassie is Spayed, Microchipped, Vaccinated and is Heartworm Negative and on preventative. You can adopt this Sweet Girl for $85. We think she is a Heeler mix. She is outgoing, friendly and will boss around other dogs but just wants to play. She is not housebroken.",

No rude or rowdy dogs, PLEASE - I am a senior lady and have no interest in being tormented.\n-Can do Apartment Living: Yes, with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation\n-Potty Trained: It appears so\n-Bite History: No\n-Positive Reward Based Obedience Classes Required: Yes, one private lesson (due to breed)\n-Energy Level: Medium\n-Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: No\n-Additional Information: Stella is an older gal looking for a nice, low-key home to spend the rest of her days! She was surrendered to us for frequently escaping her previous home, so she should never be left unattended outside. As a senior dog, Miss Stella will need more frequent vet check-ups to ensure that she is happy and healthy.

Hopefully I'll find a fund new family to adopt me and love me forever!\n\nThe people at the shelter named me Sugar because of how sweet I am.  I love people, and I love all the attention I can get.  I'm already up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and I also have a microchip.  All I need now is someone like YOU to take me home!\n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your family please stop by the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!

This sweet little guy was found as a stray in South Carolina before taking his freedom ride to Connecticut to find his happily furever after!\n\nDraco is an extremely smart pup that is eager to learn tricks and please his people. He can sit, lay down, and plays fetch like no other. He is the best of both worlds: a mild mannered snuggler and zoomie king outdoors. Draco has done well in playgroups at the shelter and is good with all dogs. Due to his high energy level, he would prefer a fellow pup that enjoys rough and tumble play, but is respectful of calmer, older dogs too. Draco is looking for an active family that enjoys hikes during the day and Netflix and puppucinos at night. You must have a fenced yard to be considered for his adoption.\n\nHis adoption fee is $350 and Draco is up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered. If you are interested in adopting this cutie, please complete the application at form.jotform.com/200883908893166. For questions, please email info@happilyfureverafter.org.",

He is blind in one eye, but doesn't let that stop his adventures.  He loves the outdoors, sunning on the deck and chasing birds. He loves car rides and walks well on a leash. He whines to let you know that he wants something, either to go out, to play or to snuggle with you. He prefers to snuggle in bed at bedtime but will grudgingly sleep in his crate. He appeared to be a Corgi mix. He is very gentle and gets along well other dogs. Not child or cat tested. No food aggression. Prefers to be with his person than alone, but is reall an all-around happy little boy who wants to be loved.\nPopeye is around 2-3 years old, utd on vaccines, microchipped, HW negative.\n\n",

            "description": "Due to COVID-19 precautions, all animals for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. Copy and paste the link to access the sign-up genius for an appointment: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet for dogs and https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1 for cats.\n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to elenahtar@gmail.com\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nRaye was found as a stray along with her brother and sister. She is very sweet and loving but very timid. Raye has been with her foster family, which includes adults, children and dogs, for about 2 months getting ready for her forever home. They have made her feel loved and shown her what it is like to have a family. She was very scared initially and has improved but takes a while to warm up to people. Once she does, she willingly approaches for pets and likes to hang out with her people on the couch. She takes a little longer to feel comfortable with children but is getting there and is gentle. She will do best in a home with another dog to help her build confidence. She does ok on a leash and enjoys going outside. Raye is looking for a loving, patient adopter who can continue to help her gain the confidence to become the wonderful dog that she is.\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Elena\nLocation: Foster Home\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

I was brought to the shelter because former owner worked long hours and couldn't give me the attention I deserved.  So now I'm here waiting for someone fun like YOU to come adopt me!!\n\nBefore I go to my new home I will be up to date on vaccinations, neutered, and will also have a microchip.  If you think I would be a good fit for your family, please stop by the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!  I'm a super friendly boy, and will be SOOOOO excited to meet you!!",

            "description": "PLEASE read bio in full!!!!\n\nThank you for your interest in adoption from Palmetto Paws. If you would like to be considered to adopt from PPAR please complete the online application on the home page. Completing an application does not guarantee an adoption. The age to be considered for adoption is 21.\n\nWe will not consider applications for those not able to meet/adopt on the next upcoming Saturday or at a time designated by the rescue. Adoptions are done usually on Saturdays as we are all volunteers who work full time during the week. Dogs live in private foster homes. We do not host events and there is no opportunity to view multiple dogs. \nWe will not consider incomplete applications. We will not process applications that are not for a specific dog listed on petfinder. We do not process and \"hold\" applications. We do not ship dogs and we do not arrange transports. All adopters must be present to complete the adoption. If an adopter is approved we do a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d with a specific dog or pup. If at the meet we all agree it\u2019s a good match, then the adoption takes place at that time. Their is no opportunity to meet and adopt at a later date. Again, please only apply if you are available on Saturday and ready to adopt.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. We will never promise a particular breed or adult size.\n\nWe do our best to put all info we have in the bio. We will not respond to inquires regarding information that is already detailed in the bio. \n\nMy name is Cricket . I am about 10 years old and I weigh around 10 pounds. I was being given away on a swap page on Thanksgiving 2020. I was so matted that you could not even see my face. I had to be shaved by the groomer and then my beautiful face was revealed, as were my blinding cataracts. I was taken to Dr Fischer at Animal Eye Care of the Lowcounty and long story short I have new lenses and now have perfect vision. I have had two follow up appointments and all went fantastic. I will need an adopter who will continue to be able to take me to future appointments with the specialist and continue needed eye drops. The adopter will cover the cost of all future visits and medications so if that is not something you are willing to do then please do not apply. \nCricket has also been seen by our Vet and had a complete senior blood panel done, spay and dental. As she is a senior and already has medical needs please think about this prior to applying- seniors need to see the Vet more frequently, and develop medical issues just as us older humans do.\n\nCricket resides in a home with dogs, cats and a toddler. She tolerates them all just fine but a full-time toddler is not what Cricket would prefer. She is very good with Charlotte but doesn't want the full-time attention of a small child. Cricket is fine with the cats and good with the large dogs in the home. We feel cricket would do fine with or without other dogs as long as the other dogs are not constantly wanting to play as she is not interested.\nCricket would prefer to be in your lap or held at all times (as many littles do).  She is very sweet and loving. She has had no accidents since early intake. She is decent on leash and rides well in the car. She even went on vacation with her foster family and did great!\n\nAll adopters are provided with a medical summary, a new collar and leash, an opportunity to go over basic training/pet care and help shopping for supplies if needed. \n\n The adoption fee is $425 .\n\nIf interested in adoption please submit an application! The application is found on our home page at palmettopaws.petfinder.com \n\n\n",

This five-year-old, 24 lb, boy came to us after his owner passed away.\n\nThis sweet little boy loves nothing more than to cuddle and relax on the couch. He's a bit shy, so it will take him some time to warm up. But all good things to come to those who wait because once he's comfortable, he'll be all over you! In typical Velcro Frenchie fashion, Anthony will drape himself across your lap and sneak in some kisses. His tongue doesn't quite fit in his mouth, so be ready for a kiss attack! A quirk of his is to sit straight up on his bottom when he'd like some belly rubs.\n\nAnthony isn't so energetic and would be fine with a daily walk. Even though he's a couch potato, he enjoys playtime. He loves small soft balls. He would love it if you threw a ball to him so that he can hit it back to you with his nose. Once he's done playing, it's cuddle time! You can level up your cuddling, with Anthony, by letting him under the covers so he can curl up against you.\n\nHe is a smart boy but can be a little mischievous! His future family will have to establish themselves as the pack leader due to his dominant personality. Anthony has also been known to be a performer. He'll show off his tricks of sit, sit pretty and stay. He is a bulldog though, so he may not always want to. Part of this may be due to the fact that his hearing isn't the best.\n\nAnthony gets anxious around new people, places and busy settings. If strangers approach him, he will try and lunge at them or try to bite someone trying to pet him. Anthony's foster home has found some techniques to help with introducing him to new people, which they'll teach his new family.\n\nAnthony will do best in a laid back home with someone that has experience with the bully breeds. The ideal home for Anthony is with adults only. Anthony prefers women, but we think he would do fine with a man as long as they're patient and give him space. In the past, he bit two men who did not respect his space, even though they were asked to. Due to his fear of strangers, Anthony would not do well in a city or busy area. We feel he would do better in the suburbs or a rural area in a single family home.\n\nDue to his anxiety, Anthony wouldn't be a fit to go to work or be home all day by himself.\n\nAnthony's future home should not have other dogs or cats due to his high prey drive. He is territorial of his home and becomes overstimulated easily, which can cause him to lash out. His energy can be unappealing to some dogs because when he gets anxious, it's hard for him to settle down.\n\nLike most Frenchies, Anthony has allergies and needs to avoid chicken, turkey and beef. To help with his itchiness, Anthony takes an allergy supplement and gets a monthly medicated bath. A fish supplement could also help keep the itchies at bay. In his arsenal of tricks, Anthony knows \"no feeties\" to stop licking his paws. He will also need to have his anal glands expressed regularly. \n\nAnthony is very loyal and thrives when he is with his people at home. If you think you are his new best friend, submit a S.N.O.R.T. adoption application today! His fee is $500.\n\nPlease submit an adoption application on our website!  https://www.snortrescue.org/adoption-process/adoption-application/\n\nNote: All dogs in SNORT's care are fostered in private homes by  dedicated volunteers. SNORT's adoption fee includes appropriate veterinary care, all necessary vaccines, and a spay/neuter. SNORT posts regular updates about our foster dogs on our Facebook page,  http://www.facebook.com/pages/SNORT-Short-Noses-Only-Rescue-Team/128712140542769.

They enjoy sharing meals, playing together and even playing tug-a-war with their sweaters.  They love the outdoors and enjoy being chased by my other pups.  After playtime, they love to snuggle together in their cozy bed or enjoy our laps.  When it's night night time, they will get in their crate by themselves.  They do well with smaller dogs but do shy away from larger ones.  \n\nWe are taking applications for them at www.tinypawsrescue.com. We will not review or consider your application if it's not completely filled out, if the vet on your current or past that is not listed, first time dog owner, must have a fence yard, no children under the age of 12 in the home, and must live in Texas. \n",

            "description": "Hi there. These cuties are the Roman Gods and Goddesses litter. They were born approximately 12/02, so they're currently 8 weeks old. We aren't quite sure what breed mix they are. We believe that Mom (Mathilda) is a Labrador Retriever, possibly with some pit or terrier DNA. We don't know who the pups' dad is, but based on the puppies' looks and build, dad might have been a hound dog, possibly a pointer. Whatever breed mix they are, they are happy, healthy puppies. And they are lucky puppies. Their entire pack were stays, and a concerned citizen who had been feeding the pack and had been working to gain their trust called Animal Control for help. AC picked up Mathilda, the puppies and an older sibling. So the puppies have been in foster care about four weeks, and they are friendly, social puppies. They love everyone, and they enjoy being held. They love to run and play. They love toys. They love going for walks in the woods with their foster mom's pack - dogs and goats. They're just a bunch of happy puppies - they love everything! But what they'd really love most of all is a family of their own. Could that be you? The pups are being fostered in Eatonton, and they'll be ready to go home with their furever families next week.\n\nAll of these puppies will be totally vetted - up to date on vaccines, worming, heartworm preventative, microchipped and spayed / neutered. They're still just young pups though, so they have yet to learn about house training and obedience training. \n\nIf you are interested in giving one of the Gods and Goddesses puppies a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html. It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt; however, it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal. Please note that several of the puppies have already been pre-adopted. We currently have one little girl (Nona) and three of the boys available.\n\nBefore submitting an application, please make sure your references (landlord, personal and veterinary) are aware that you are looking to adopt a pet and that we may be calling for a reference. Please note, our volunteers may call from other than a Georgia area code. If we are unable to reach your references, the person calling will leave a voice mail, if it is set up on the phone. If personal references fail to call us back, the application remains in a pending status and cannot be processed further. Please allow up to a week, or more in some cases, for us to process your application, we are primarily a volunteer organization and at certain times can receive very high volumes of applications and emails.\n\nIf your application is approved, we will contact you to proceed with the adoption process. If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us, we will be glad to help!",

We believe they are lab/catahoula mixes or maybe even some carolina dog. Both girls were very scared after being in the shelter. They settled into their foster home and have been doing great. Thelma loves to sleep on the bed and couch. She is great with other dogs and cats. She is about 9 months old or so according to the vet and weighs 30lbs. If you believe Thelma would be a fit please submit an application (link below). She is still in Texas and will be on her way to PA this week. She may need a few days or more to settle in once she arrives before being ready to meet potential adopters. \n\nAdoption Application:\nhttps://airtable.com/shr305FuyR4v4JWQb\n\nFacebook Link:\nhttps://m.facebook.com/furrytalesanimalrescue/\n\nWebsite Link: https://furrytalesrescue.wixsite.com/home\n\n** We are based out of Blue Bell, PA. We allow out of state adoptions to NJ, MD, DE, and NY. At this time we do not adopt out to homes who are over 120 miles from our location. We do prioritize more local applications who are a match for the dog/puppy they are applying for.*\n\n",

At approximately 5 years old, I love to run, play, fetch and then chill out and lay around. I am crate trained and house trained I am eager to please, smart, and learn fast. I sit perfectly for your attention and for treats. I would be best behaved and happiest with exercise and rules. \nHow social am I? Well I am kind and easy going. Trusting and loving, I enjoy my people and I like when strangers say hello, too! I am great on car rides, but need more training on walks. So far, I've played well with other dogs. I just want to play! My people have observed me taking correction well from my canine friends. I have not been tested with cats or other small animals, but I definitely notice them from a distance and have a prey drive. \nI feel pretty good! I have experienced some intestinal issues, but am feeling much better. I must maintain my excellent nutritional diet! It is good for my skin type, too A weird thing: I was trying to eat my own feces! I've been improving, but sometimes am still tempted. That will need continued attention so that I can stay healthy and strong. \n\nIf you'd like to know more about me, let us know! \nWoof, \nGarrison Primary Color: Blue Secondary Color: White Weight: 69lbs Age: 5yrs 2mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Tell you about Cordy, you say?\n \nWe'd love to.\n \nCordy is a very special dog who has not had an easy life. Cordy (and her friend Boots) came from a hoarding case and never got the socialization that puppies so desperately need. So nowCordy has a lot of catching up to do, and we have stepped in to help her do just that! It's the \"Teach Cordy how to do real dog stuff\" team.\n \nWe are slowly watching joy seep its way out of Cordy. First tail wags, first zoomies, first \"oh my god that feels so good\" wiggles during a solid butt scratch. Patience is key with Cordy, but we are slowly seeing some of the milestones we have been waiting for. Cordy needs extremely patient humans who understand that she has a long way to go, but are willing to put in the time and reap the rewards. Fast movements, loud sounds and new things are all very scary to her and she will need time to learn these things will not hurt her. She is not leash trained and still panics when she reaches the end of the leash, but we are taking time in getting her comfortable with the feeling. She is great at keeping her space clean and knows that outside time is potty time.\n \nOne thing that seems to build Cordy's confidence is having a confident dog friend around. Cordy takes her time getting comfortable around dog friends (a lot of time) and needs a canine friend who is willing to go at her pace. But a confident friend can go a long way to teach this special girl how to do real dog stuff. Cordy is seeking an adult only home with a dog friend and no kitties. Cordy would gladly go home with her friend Boots who came from the same background, but can go home without her as well. We are requiring a fenced in yard for Cordy as she is not leash trained and can panic at times, and this would be the safest option for her.\n \nIf you are interested in Cordy, have lots of patience, a securely fenced in yard and a dog looking for a buddy (or a student of life?), please call the shelter at 603-472-3647 to speak with an adoption counselor.",

            "description": "This is our friend Boots.\n \nBoots is a very, very unique lady with a lot of learning to do. Boots (and her pal Cordy) came from a hoarding situation where she did not get the socialization that puppies so desperately need. So, she has a lot of catching up to do to learn how to be a \"real dog\". A lot of things are new to her. Being touched, being pet, playing, all dog stuff really. But us staff are dedicated to find the joyful dog we know is inside her.\n \nBoots will need a lot of time, a lot of patience, and a lot of love. We are still working on finding the things that bring Boots enough joy to break down her walls. She is a lady who likes to be on the move. Once she is on a leash she enjoys walking around and this is when we see the most excitement in her. When things are still, Boots has too much time to think and her walls go back up. She has spent more time with one of our staff than the others and has shown that she can develop a relationship and a bond, but her bond still looks quite different than the normal dog's human-animal bond. We do not think that the shelter is the right environment to break Boots' walls down, but we are doing everything we can despite. We believe Boots' will make more progress in a quiet home with more consistency and a routine, and lots of love.\n \nBecause Boots is not leash trained, we do require a fenced in yard for her. Boots can live with other dogs, however she does not appear to have a whole lot of interest in them, so she will need a dog who will give her space as she is not interested in playing at this point in her life. Super playful dogs seeking a BFF will not find that in Boots. She is seeking an adult only home without cats. Boots certainly could go home with her friend Cordy, but it is not a necessity.\n \nIf you are interested in Boots please call the shelter at 603-472-3647 to speak with an adoption counselor.",

I love, love, love my people, so much so that I may not like to share them with visitors. But that is okay, I would not mind some time to myself if you do have someone visit our home. I already know sit and my previous home said I was housetrained. Score!! They also let shelter staff know that I do not always share well with other dogs. Going to a home as the only dog is not a must but may be best. My ideal home is a quieter, but active, ADULT only home where there are not too many visitors. I would not be a fit for an apartment setting. If you love a dog with a little grey on their face and someone who will love you to the moon and back, then look no further.

I'm so excited to see you and play, that I tend to get in others personal space. My education has been a little lacking, but if you're ready to teach and have yummy treats, I'm ready to learn. My adoption even comes with FREE, yes FREE, classes. With time and patience, I can show you just how smart I could be! I would do best in a home with an owner who has had some experience owning high energy dogs and will like to exercise my mind by teaching me fun new things! I will need a home without children under the age of 12. A fenced in yard is a must, so no apartment living for me. I may do best as the only dog in the home but I would love to meet any calm, resident females to see if I could be a fit; maybe it will be a match made in heaven! Rico is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program.

He loves exploring the backyard, playing with other dogs, doesn't mind cats, and is very social. He has never met a stranger! He does great with kids and really loves when they play with him. Dash has dry eye, which is very common in Shih Tzu's, but inexpensive lubricating eye drops fix that up! He is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative, microchipped, and recently had a dental. He is $350 plus TX sales tax with an approved application: www.recycledpomsbcs.com/adopt\n\nTexas law requires that all humane organizations (Rescues, SPCA's, Humane Societies, State nonprofit, and charitable 501c3 exempt orgs) collect and remit sales and use tax to the Texas Comptroller on their adoption fees.\n\nWe do not ship or transport our dogs. We require all adopters to meet the dog in person to ensure it is a good fit. We represent the dog to the best of our ability and since they are in rescue, we do not always get their history.\n\nPlease note: We are a non-profit Pomeranian Rescue with dogs in private foster homes. We do not have a facility open to the public. We require an approved application before a potential adopter is introduced to a dog. We contact vet references to ensure animals in the home are current on vaccinations, heart worm prevention, and sterilization.

He came to us from a rural shelter in Ohio and has enjoyed being spoiled in his foster home! He's very sweet, especially loves his foster dad, and is starting to figure out chew toys. He's getting along great with his canine foster sister and is still in the process of sweet-talking his feline foster sister into cohabitating peacefully!\n\nSermon is fully potty trained and is close to perfecting his crate training. He is great in his crate at night, but is a bit whiney during the workday. He will lay quietly on his bed for an entire workday, as long as he can be close to his humans. All in all, he's a pretty lazy pup but will play in spurts and would benefit from daily walks to try to get a few pounds off of him!\n\nHe has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and is heartworm negative. His adoption fee is $300. If you are interested in adopting Sermon, please apply on our website, www.prodogshio.org/adoptables.\n\nHe's being fostered in the Cincinnati area. Please note, we only schedule meet and greets with approved applicants. We are not currently hosting adoption events due to Covid.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe appreciate your support, in order to help us continue to rescue dogs! Donations can be made via our PayPal account - info@prodogsohio.org.\nYou must be willing to commute to the location that the pet is being fostered in order to be eligible to adopt. We do not ship our pets. We also require that you personally bring the pet back to us should the adoption not work out.\nWe do NOT negotiate adoption fees. All money goes to support our rescue operation. We are 100% volunteered based.\nWe require your current dog(s) to be current on vaccines and heartworm prevention.\nApply online at www.prodogsohio.org, under the Adoptables tab.\nDue to the volume of apps and inquiries, we may not be able to respond to everyone.",

Luna (5) and Aurora (9) are bonded (in every sense of the word) and are ALWAYS near each other. Both of these girls have their own personalities, mom being a bit more relaxed and reserved and daughter being more active and curious. You will get the both of two worlds when you adopt these two. \n\nThey would do best as the only pets in the home as they can still be a bit nervous. Dog-savvy family and property with room to run would be best, even though they walk great on leash.\nThis listing is a courtsey listing contact the Monmout County SPCA \ninfo@monmouthcountyspca.org\n732-542-0040",

I was sitting in a pound worried about my future when something good happened - a local vet tech school came and got me out so I could help the students learn about becoming vet techs. I have a lot of fun here at school and am treated very well, I get lots of attention. And they are helping me find a new home so I will have a place of my very own at the end of this semester.\n\nMy name is Rain, I am an older girl, but I still have lots of spunk.  I found myself in this predicament with two of my daughters, Snow and Misty.  I still love to run and play with them, but also enjoy a good game of soccer.  I have great manners and I am a good listener.  In my profile picture I am teaching one of my girls how to sit nicely.   Please consider giving me the best years of my life with you!\n \nCome meet me! Please email or text Charlie to get an application and make an appointment to come and meet me.

            "description": "***URGENT - Chester needs an adoptive or foster home by Jan. 31st, 2021. Please thoroughly read through is bio below to see if you are able to help Chester.***\n\n**Due to Chester's behavioural needs please submit a application first at www.rapsbc.com. Management will review applications and set up meet and greets for suitable applicants only. Please call us at 604-275-2036 if you have any questions.**\n\nPERSONALITY: Meet Chester - our very handsome but also rather complex fellow.\n\nChester suffers from anxiety, is under socialized and can be fearful - especially with new places, people and dogs. Because of this he is fear reactive to both people and dogs. Chester is also affected by environmental stimulus and can quickly reach and go over his thresholds. Therefore, Chester requires to always wear a muzzle when out for walks and other excursions - his new parents or family must be comfortable with this.\n\nBeing in the Shelter causes Chester quite a bit of stress and which causes him to act out more often due to his anxiety - he is currently on medication to help with this anxiety. We have also come to learn that he has barrier reactivity. When Chester is in these heightened states he will sometimes redirect - he has put his mouth on many of the kennel attendants.\n\nChester was being fostered by our Assistant Manager for a few months and did quite well, though still reactive in certain situations to new people or dogs. Chester was a loveable, silly boy in his foster home and enjoyed having zoomies in the yard and playing with toys, so we know he has the potential to be a good boy - he just needs the right family to come along. We also had our trainer work with Chester and he did quite well and was able to hang out with some of her dogs when introduced properly.\n\nChester needs a calm household with no other animals and no children. He requires calm, confident handlers that are willing to work with him on his behavioural needs as well as ongoing socialization. Chester is also not fully house trained so will need someone that can positively help him learn this. Having Chester in your life will require a lifestyle adjustment but he is definitely worth it.\n\nLastly, due to Chester's breeds - we believe Wheaten Terrier/Poodle - he needs regular grooming.\n\nLIKES: Zoomies and Playtime\n\nDISLIKES: New Situations\n\nAGE: Approximately 2 years & 10 months\n\nIf you are interested in Chester, you can call our shelter at 604-275-2036, or email us at info@rapsbc.com.",

Emailing or texting will provide a faster response than phone. \n\n===========================\n\nHello! I was sitting in a pound worried about my future when something good happened - a local vet tech school came and got me out so I could help the students learn about becoming vet techs. I have a lot of fun here at school and am treated very well, I get lots of attention. And they are helping me find a new home so I will have a place of my very own at the end of this semester.\n\nOh I should introduce myself, I am Hailey.  I love to take care rides as you can see from my profile photo.  I know how to sit and shake, with my right or left paw, I am so gentle and loving and have a soft mouth when accepting food/treats.  I am potty trained, which is a plus for both of us.  I love people and would be up for lots of road trips.  Please consider making me a part of your family. \n\nCome meet me!   Text or email to get an application and schedule an appointment to meet me. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic we will not be having a public meet and greet.  \n\nSincerely,\nHailey\n\n============================\n\nAdoption fee $85.  Spayed, shots, heartworm tested, microchipped.   Contact crobert3@jeffco.edu for adoption information.",

            "description": "Molly and Gary are a BONDED PAIR AND WILL NOT BE SEPARATED.  They must be adopted together.   Both dogs are represented in this bio to make it clear that they are a bonded pair and must be adopted together.\n\nMolly is a pure bred Female Golden Retriever who was born and raised in Turkey!. She is one of 38 beautiful Golden Retrievers who have been rescued from the harsh conditions animals must endure in that country and has been living in her present US home for three years.  As you can see, she is a lovely five year old English Cream Golden Retriever who is quite the joy to her present family but sadly, due to a recent divorce, the Mom feels she is overwhelmed with a full time job, two young boys, two dogs and a home so she is making the very difficult choice to surrender Molly and her \"brother\" back to GREAT Rescue.\n\nGary is the little boy who always has a stuffed toy in his mouth. He is a little smaller than Molly, is 2 1/2 years old and also came to GREAT Rescue after being rescued at 8 weeks of age from a local animal shelter along with his two sisters and brother.  Lucky for that sweet and gentle boy to be adopted into a home where he could enjoy the love of a wonderful family, two boys and, of course, of his new friend and mentor, Molly. Gary is believed to be a Lab mix with a truly \"Golden Retriever\" heart!\n\nMolly and Gary are both excellent in the house although Gary is crated when no one is home and they ride well in the car. They have had professional training at Jet Set which has also offered a refresher session to their new family.  Molly is more of a Mama's girl while Gary loves everyone.  They love to wrestle and play with each other, go to the dog park and take long walks daily.\n\nBoth are in excellent health- they are heartworm negative, spayed/neutered, current on all vaccinations, wormed, chipped and looking for their new forever home.  THEIR NEW HOME MUST BE IN THE JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA AREA, HAVE A FENCED YARD, A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WILL WALK THEM DAILY, NO OTHER PETS AND SOMEONE WHO IS HOME MUCH OF THE TIME.  THEY WILL NOT BE SEPARATED.  \n\nWe are seeking a Foster to Adopt home for Molly and Gary.  If you are interested in making Molly and Gary part of your family, go to greatresscue.org to complete/submit a foster application or wait until tomorrow for the new adoption application to be posted.  For additional information, please contact greatrescue@comcast.net or 501-6899.",

Emailing or texting will provide a faster response than phone. \n\n===========================\n\nHello! I was sitting in a pound worried about my future when something good happened - a local vet tech school came and got me out so I could help the students learn about becoming vet techs. I have a lot of fun here at school and am treated very well, I get lots of attention. And they are helping me find a new home so I will have a place of my very own at the end of this semester.\n\nBy the way, my name is Thunder.  I am just the sweetest boy.  I love a nice soft bed to curl up in and take naps.  I also love wagging my tail any time I see a human near by.  I love to take walks and sniff all the nice smells outside.  I am a very loving and gentle soul.  Please consider being my forever family.  I promise to be a very good boy. \n\nCome meet me! Text or email to request an application and  schedule an appointment to come and meet me.  Due to the pandemic we will not do a public adoption event. \n\nSincerely,\nThunder\n\n============================\n\nAdoption fee $85.  Spayed, shots, heartworm tested, microchipped.

(one of the bio pics is what they looked like when our volunteers first saw them) Thankfully, two of our wonderful volunteers happened upon them, loaded them up in the car and drove off to heat and safety. Nick is VERY sweet and is medium to high energy. He loves to run and play! Such a total goofball. He gets along with other dogs and LOVES every single person that he is introduced to. He will be a wonderful addition to any loving home.\nThis dog is spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested negative for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $400 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.  This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05. \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!  If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

These sweet 11 week old, 10lb sisters were saved from a shelter in St. Croix.  We believe they will be on the small side of medium as adults.  The girls are a bit shy with humans at first, and they adore other dogs.  They would do best with another well adjusted dog in the home to show them the ropes.  The pups are playful and food motivated, making for easy training!\n\nThe sisters are spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and have been treated with flea/tick/heartworm preventative.  Their adoption fee is $375.00.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.roadtriprescues.com, under the \u201cADOPT\u201d tab.\n\n- Do not use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible.  If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES - WE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE AND ALL OF OUR DOGS LIVE WITH US AS FAMILY. \n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

FOREVER HOME MUST HAVE A FRIENDLY, YOUNG,\n\nPLAYFUL AND CONFIDENT RESIDENT DOG OR TWO!\n\nMEET BUTTERCUP, a beautiful, 18 month old and 45lb lab mix who recently found herself in a terribly precarious situation. Poor little BUTTERCUP was lost alone and frightened, running with cows in a pasture while being shot at by the farmer. She's a very lucky girl, as she did avoid getting shot long enough for a good samaritan to get her to safety.\n\nShe is currently in an awesome foster home and her foster momma shares: \"Buttercup is doing great. All is going wonderfully! She is such a sweet sweet girl. She was a little shy in the beginning, but warmed up quickly. She is learning so much from having two brothers. She is still settling into her foster home, learning to just relax and lay down when my resident dogs do. She loves to play and is great with toys. She's a smart girl and highly treat and praise motivated. She is getting used to the crate, plays wonderfully with the boys and no accidents in the house. Buttercup is a champion cuddle bug and enjoys lots of pets and love!\" More soon so dog-ear Buttercup's page and come back soon.\n\nBUTTERCUP is spayed and up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. Her adoption fee is $425. Please note that training is highly recommended for all dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing.\n\nTHANKS FOR ADOPTING AND SAVING A LIFE; you are BUTTERCUP'S hero!",

These sweet 11 week old, 10lb sisters were saved from a shelter in St. Croix.  We believe they will be on the small side of medium as adults.  The girls are a bit shy with humans at first, and they adore other dogs.  They would do best with another well adjusted dog in the home to show them the ropes.  The pups are playful and food motivated, making for easy training!\n\nThe sisters are spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and have been treated with flea/tick/heartworm preventative.  Their adoption fee is $375.00.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.roadtriprescues.com, under the \u201cADOPT\u201d tab.\n\n- Do not use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible.  If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES - WE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE AND ALL OF OUR DOGS LIVE WITH US AS FAMILY. \n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

Rosie is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed and negative for ehrlichia and other common diseases.\n\nRosie is very dog friendly and will need some help with her potty training for the lack of consistent training.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the breed please research the breed attributes before applying, Basset Hounds are great family dogs and can be stubborn and vocal at some times, even with they easy going personality.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Breed mix info is the best guess of ScratchMyBelly and our vets. There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test.\n\nHomes with doggie doors will not be approved, sorry we are seeing a lot of problems with unsupervised animals and wild life.\n\nWe require a Home Check to set you & our Dog up for a successful transition into his/her furever home. This is only about the safety of the dog & in no way a judgement of you or your home. Our contract states that should you not want our Dog for ANY reason we will happily take our Dog back into our Rescue.\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\n1. Submit Application\nGo to our website www.scratchmybelly.org/forms. Your application is not a guarantee of placement, our process is not first come, first serve and we have the right to refuse the application. If you \u201crent\u201d please make sure you check with your Landlord you can have a pet prior to submitting your application, many landlords have weight and/or breed restrictions.\n\n2. Interview\nWe endeavor to make sure we are matching you with the right dog so a phone interview helps to insure we are all on the same page.\n\n3. Meet the Pet\nWe can Meet n Greet at Home Check or you meet the foster. Every situation is different. We try to accommodate each on a personal level.\n\n4. Home Check\nWe check for safety for the dog. We know our dogs well & can spot a potential problem quickly. We also call this a meet n greet.\n\n5. Sign Adoption Contract\nContracts are signed the day of adoption, we accept PayPal to the Rescue Group & the Dog goes to his new home.\n\nDue to the hundreds of inquires we cannot guarantee anything. ALL THE APPLICATIONS ARE SENT TO THE FOSTER FOR REVIEW.   IF THE FOSTER CHOOSES YOUR HOME FOR A PUPPY, SHE WILL \"CALL YOU\" WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIVING YOUR APPLICATION.   OTHERWISE, YOU WILL NOT HEAR FROM THE FOSTER.\n\nIt does not help us if you are sending us multiple emails, texts and calls. \nWe are a volunteer based rescue organization.\n\n\n",

            "description": "\"Big Silly Pyr\" Meet handsome Bain, a big goofy Pyr born around January 2020. Still, very much a puppy, weighing 75 lbs, he was rescued by the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society from a Texas animal shelter as a stray.\n\nBain is sociable and gets along with everyone, and has some basic training. He requires a resident canine companion to show him the ropes and help him settle into his new home. A big securely fenced yard to run and play would keep Bain exercised and safe.\n\nHe would do well in an active home with older, considerate kids. He is a fun, bright Pyr and needs assured leaders in his family familiar with Pyr characteristics and habits. Please complete an Adoption Application if Bain would fit perfectly with your family.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\nOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\nPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\nPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\nPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\nApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\nThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\nAdoption Fee $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

            "description": "Maverick was rescued out of a high kill shelter and is a very sweet dog. He is a dog that needs adventure and activity because of his energy level. He desires time outside walking or hiking. He might need older children due to his energy and a person or family acquainted with strong dogs. He is super friendly and loving. If he went through simple obedience training and got the exercise needed I believe he would be a fantastic family member and pet. If you need to be outside and active, he is your guy!!! He is crate trained and working on house training. Maverick had a terrible owner before and deserves a life of love and fun!!!\nThis dog is spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested negative for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $400 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.  This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05. \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!  If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

I know sit, paw, down and we are working on lie down! I love to keep busy with puzzles and toys. I'd love a home with people who are active and outdoorsy, so I can go on long walks and adventures! I am already leash-trained and house-trained! After a long day of exercise and play, I love cuddle time. I love all people and would like to be the center of your world. I may have a bit too much energy for small children, but I still love them! My last owners recently got another dog and brought me here because I didn't get along with him. I want to be your one and only pet, I love affection! I don't mind seeing well-behaved dogs, but I prefer them at a distance. I love to play, cuddle, and learn new things! I can be talkative and may bother your neighbors if you live in an apartment or townhouse, so a single family home with a yard (especially if it's fenced in!) is where I would do best. I can't wait to meet you; I hope you love me as much as I'll love you! A generous donor has sponsored my adoption fee! That means approved adopters can take me home for $0 and use that money to spoil me with Christmas gifts!\n\nDISCLAIMER: Lana MUST be in the only pet in a home. She cannot live with cats, dogs, or other small animals. \n\nIf interested in adoption, please submit an online adoption application. After we process your application, we will contact you to schedule an appointment! Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment, only after we have received and reviewed your application. Thank you!",

He bit his owner over food; but apparently he was also beaten with a spatula several times.\n\nSince he has been at the shelter, Rango has learned to trust people again and enjoys playing ball and going for walks.  His leash manners are excellent, and he willingly trades his tennis balls when asked.  At this point, he is working on his food bowl issues, and he is looking for an owner that understands behavior modification practices.\n\nThe shelter's trainer is willing to work with prospective adopters who want to give this boy a second chance for a happy and secure life.\n\nDue to Covid, the shelter is has an appointment only policy. We ask potential adopters to fill out our application, prior to a scheduled meeting. The staff is very accommodating, and we welcome any inquires.\n\nThis link will take you to our adoption application.\nhttps://capemaycountynj.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5814/Adoption-Application",

She is an adorable dog with a crazy under bite that gives her a unique look.\n\nMolly is food aggressive, therefore she needs a consistent, experienced owner committed to continuing a behavior plan. The shelter will pro-active in her training. The shelter has been working with Molly using positive training and she is responding very well. In fact, Molly is learning many excellent behaviors including walking well on the leash, waiting for treats and the food bowl, sitting, coming when called (here) and stay. She does an awesome high five for a treat. \n\nAlthough Molly lived with a family consisting of children, 2 cats (which frightened her by bopping her with their paws), and another dog, we feel she is best suited to a quiet adult household.\n\nDue to Covid, the shelter is has an appointment only policy. We ask potential adopters to fill out our application, prior to a scheduled meeting. The staff is very accommodating, and we welcome any inquires.\n\nThis link will take you to our adoption application.\nhttps://capemaycountynj.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5814/Adoption-Application\n\n",

He is a very happy, active puppy and will do well in a home that can keep him well exercised physically and mentally.   Another younger dog would be ideal.   We are unsure about apartment living.  His size is good but at this point, he will bark when left alone.   He's a great little guy and he's fully vetted.

My name is Trouble but, don't let that worry you because I'm a very good boy. My foster mom and dad say I'm no trouble at all. I am 10-12 year old so I'm a pro at telling you when I need to go out. I like lots of love, petting and enjoy napping during the day. I love to nestle under blankets and be close to my foster mom. If you're looking for your shadow then I'm your man. I will need to be with someone who is home most of the time because I have separation anxiety and enjoy the company of my people. I like walks and sniffing along the way and do well on my leash. I'm not a big fan of the snow or rain but, I will go outside to do my business quickly. I have 3 cat foster siblings and I like them. Sometimes I follow them when they leave the room and they don't always like that so I return to where I was sitting. \nThe only thing I ask is that you not sneak up on me because I get startled. I don't chew on things that aren't mine and I take good care of my toys. My cheetah bear is my favorite and I like to carry him around. I like to play a quick game of fetch before I go to bed and then I crawl under a blanket for the night. My foster mom says I'm the best boy ever.\n\n(Added  )\n\nApplication, veterinary reference, adoption fee and home check required to adopt. APPLY TO ADOPT VIA our link: http://midwestbtrescue.org/\n\nNOTE: Please do not email for more dog info. This is all the info available until approved and then you can talk directly to that dogs foster home for further info. Thank you!",

He also loves car rides and the best belly rubs you can give! He's great with other dogs when introduced properly, but prefers the company of calm dogs. Burlap would make a great companion for someone working from home or a low key family. He prefers a calm environment and is doing great with his crate training. He LOVES his dog bed and gets cozy in it every chance he gets. Do you have a place in your heart and home for a gentle senior like Burlap?",

            "description": "7 1/2 years old.  45lbs.  JJ made his way up to us from TN where he was pulled from an overcrowded shelter.  Poor boy was heartworm positive so he was treated by the rescue down South.  His poor teeth are so worn down, he may have lived his life outside on a chain chewing rocks. He was in such bad shape and suffered major hair loss.  After many medicated baths and a good diet his fur has grown in nicely.   He will need some work on his housebreaking as he was most likely kept outside all the time.  With structure, crate training and some patience this can be overcome.  He is a gentle soul.  He needs to learn how to walk on the leash, not sure if he ever has before.  JJ is a special boy who needs a kind, patient soul to spoil him after the rough life he has had.

Roco does have a nice, easygoing disposition. He was already neutered and had a microchip but the number associated with the chip has been disconnected. He is a pit mix approximately 18 to 24 months old. Roco is friendly, playful and well socialized.  \nApplicants for Roco must be homeowners with bully-breed experience. \nRoco has been heartworm tested negative, was already neutered, and is current on vaccinations. You will receive health records and a bag of Science Diet food upon adoption. Adoption donation $160. \n\nThe Clinton County Humane Society is a no-kill, nonprofit, volunteer-based organization. We do not receive county or government funding and depend on our adoption donations to fund the shelter. Please complete the pre-adoption questionnaire at clintoncohumanesociety.org. We will contact you via email.",

Angel does prefer to be the only fur baby, as she does not like to share her toys that she loves soooo very much. But she absolutely loves every human she meets and just wants tons of love. Angel enjoys snoozing in the sun, yummy treats, belly rubs, oh and did we mention how much she loves toys! She is just so silly and sweet and deserves to get all the spoiling and attention all to herself. Angel can not wait to find her furever home and hopes it will be very soon.\nThis dog is spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested ****** for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $400 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.

Hes cuddly and affectionate but not a couch potato. Elf needs an active family who will spend time helping him burn his energy and working on his mouthiness (so he needs a home with older children). He is eager to please, is a dog park SUPERSTAR , is super food motivated and will do anything for a yummy treat! He will make a wonderful family dog and cant wait to meet you.",

As a senior, she qualifies for our Senior and Special Needs (SAS) Pet Program - this means that her adoption fee can actually be credited towards the vet clinic of the adoptive familys choice. Read more about our SAS Pet Program down below! \n\n \n\nBefore considering adding Moya to your family, please note that KPAL Rescue has a mandatory adoption process in place which includes a background check and a home visit. More information on our adoption process can be found in our pinned post, please read that (and this adoption post) in their entirety - our process cannot be waived. We do not ship our animals and we do not allow for third-party transportation.\n\n \n\nThis mature, polite lady has legs for days and is already potty-trained! Her dream home consists of family members that know how to be gentle and are spatially aware as she does have old hips and they can be sensitive to touch. She likes to be outside so a fenced yard or someone willing to walk her several times a day is ideal. She walks fairly well on a leash, but pulls a little if she sees something that peaks her interest. She is not fond of gunshots or fireworks. Her foster says she loves attention and isnt afraid to ask for it. She does have a little anxiety when left alone so somebody that can hang out at home with her or take her along is best. She loves car rides and will just lie down and rest her head on the center console, but does need a little extra help hopping in. Moya has previously had a negative encounter with a loose dog and this has led to her becoming very defensive around other dogs therefore shed be better as an only dog. She has not met cats. Moya would love to try the nearest doggy bed to you. \n\n \n\nKPAL Rescue dogs are fully vetted (vaccinated, microchipped, etc.) and spayed/neutered. Moya has no known health issues at this time but is classified as a senior so she qualifies for our Senior and Special Needs (SAS) Pet Program. This means that her adoption fee ($350) can be credited towards the veterinary clinic of the adoptive familys choice for any future medical expenses (medications, surgeries, end-of-life, etc.) for Moya. Serious inquires only, please, and feel free to share. \n\n \n\nIf youre interested in adopting Moya, our adoption process is outlined in our pinned post and on our website: www.kpalrescue.org/pet-adoption/. Our Adoption Application can also be found on that website.\n\n \n\n#kpalrescue\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n#animalrescue #rescue #alaskananimalrescue #alaskarescue #alaskaanimalrescue #animallovers #nonprofitorganization #kenaipeninsula #kenai #soldotna #adoptme #adoptabledog #rescuedog #dogsofalaska #alaskadog #dogsofthekenaipeninsula #rescuedogs #mixedbreed #moya #goodgirl #takemehome #senior #saspetprogram #seniordog",

I don't chew on my clothing collection, I keep them safe and just like to have them near me. I very much enjoy being around humans and Geronimo. I'll hang out with you and quietly ask for attention. Another of my hobbies is exploring. I like to check out as much of my surroundings as I can. You never know if there's a toy or sock around that I can find. \n\nI'm also pretty athletic. In fact, I'm a good jumper and my family will need to have a tall fence to ensure I am safe when I play in our yard. Although, to be honest, most of my jumping is to get over barriers when I'm separated from my humans. \n\nWould you like to meet a faithful, happy, playful girl? Please click on my link for more information and let the nice Demi's humans know that we should have a playdate.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website - https://demisanimalrescue.com/demis-adoption-application/ \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, mircochipped, heartworm tested (if over 6 months old) and up to date on vaccinations (combo shot, bordetella, rabies(if age appropriate) )",

He was not a seeing eye dog, but he was a constant companion for five years until further health issues required the owner to have to move to a care facility. The sister took Doc for a couple of weeks but he was not happy there and they were used to small dogs and did not want him, so they reached out and we agreed to take him. A few days later we had a foster and called to coordinate getting him and the sister had turned him into the shelter. This poor dog that was already depressed and confused now found himself in a scary shelter.\n\nWe have him now and he has been in a foster home but they have grandkids that come often and a very busy social life and Doc, who has literally lived cocooned with his owner, was overwhelmed and frightened. He is now in boarding and they are going to work with him to build his confidence and socialize him. When all is said and done, we think that Doc would be happiest in a quiet home with a companion or two. He is good in the house, crate trained and housetrained, very sweet and loves to play fetch. If you would like to have Doc for your best friend, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

What we found out was that he has a couple of allergies (easily addressed) and he does NOT have Lupus. What he does have is called German Shepherd Pyoderma, also known as Deep Pyoderma.\nThis is a pretty uncommon disease, and it's taken a minute to figure it out. Basically, it's a lifelong skin issue that will have flare ups and will then get better with treatment, off and on for life. Treatment will include antibiotics, medicated baths and topical treatments. Not too scary!\n\nSo Padfoot is once again looking for his forever home!\n\nThis BIG, handsome guy is such a cool dog, he will make the BEST companion.\nPadfoot is 3.5 years old and weighs in at 111lbs. He is good with other dogs and enjoys having doggy house mates, but he would also be fine as an only dog. Padfoot has a cute, fun personality and is affectionate and loving. He likes walks and car rides and squeaky toys. He is house trained, dog door trained and crate trained. He knows a few commands like sit and down and can catch a treat when thrown.\nHe is a *voracious* eater (he was basically starving when we got him!) and for that reason we are looking for a home with children over 8.\nPadfoot is not a dog that needs work behaviorally or needs a ton of exercise. His main needs are a family to love him and care for him through his pyoderma flare ups.\n\nIf you are looking for a loving companion, a loyal friend to snuggle and hang out with you, Padfoot could be the best pal you're looking for. If you are the kind of person who can give him the ongoing care he will need, apply to meet Padfoot today at rescuerovers.org 2/2/21 1:34 PM",

She gets along with other dogs her size, she doesn't engage or bother them, she does her own thing. Jory would like a quiet home, maybe a retired couple or single person to share the rest of her life with. She enjoys going out for a walk around the block so she can enjoy bird and squirrel watching and trying to catch them up in the trees. She enjoys taking naps and cuddling with you. We think the scar on her back is from getting caught under a fence. She did have a mast cell tumor (low grade) removed on December 7th and has recovered fully. She will need checkups every 3 to 6 months. If you would like to give Jory her forever home in her senior years please fill out an application at oneloveanimalrescue.org To be considered as this pet's adopter, please go to www.oneloveanimalrescue.org/adopt.html to complete your application.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.German Shepherd dogs, as well as the other herding breeds that we have in rescue, are highly active, energetic, working breeds. They require considerable vetting, exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings in order to work on his/her leash skills, manners, and social skills. These breeds make great additions to active families who will pamper them, but who will also work with them, as they are smart dogs who need leadership, structure, plenty of activity and mental stimulation. If you are new to German Shepherds (and other herding breeds), please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd (or other herding breed) dog will require before applying for one. Please review the section on our website (www.heartlandgsrescue.org) 'Is a HUGS Dog Right for You?' for additional information.This is how Peyton's awesome foster dad describes this sweet, shy boy: 'Peyton is a great dog that has improved a lot in the time that I've had him, and he is only going to keep getting better. He still has a lot to learn but he picks up things quickly, especially when treats are involved. He LOVES food! He responds well to his name. Peyton knows well 'sit', 'lay down', 'drop it', 'stay', 'leave it', and 'go to crate'. Peyton is working on his recall. By far his best trick is waiting patiently for meals until you say \"ok\". Peyton loves playing tug of war and fetch with his Kong toys and tennis balls, but his favorite is a knotted rope. I have not had luck with anything that squeaks since they only last about 15 minutes before he destroys them! When we're done playing, he likes to switch back and forth between spending time on my (his) bed or in his crate for naps. His favorite place in the house is his crate and where he feels safest. He's loves being petted but, in typical Shepherd fashion, on his terms. He is pretty independent and likes having alone time, but when it's time for bed, Peyton couldn't be cuddlier and likes to take up a minimum of 70 percent of my (his) bed.'\nSweet Peyton is cautious and introverted in new environments away from the people he knows. It will take extra time for him to adjust to his new home. Other than that, Peyton really enjoys people, whether they come to over to visit, or he sees them when he is out and about. Because of his large size (80lbs) and the fact that he has a tendency to try to greet everyone with puppyish enthusiasm, he will do best around adults (he is working on not jumping up in excitement). Peyton loves going for walks and car rides. He is great on car rides and enjoys going on them very much. He's very calm and just gazes out the car windows. Peyton used to be startled by traffic and loud noises on walks, but he is getting more used to those, and is doing better every day on walks! He loves walks in quiet areas, exploring trails, lakes, and sniffing new areas. Peyton is still a puppy at heart and knows how to use his size to his own advantage and can be a little stubborn at times (he will occasionally plant his butt down when he doesn't want to move). It just takes a little patience and persuation (or a good treat) to get him moving in the right direction! He would be great as an only dog. Peyton is currently the only dog in his foster home, but goes to doggy daycare on occasion and does well in small groups (he prefers laid-back dogs that do not get in his face). He also enjoys walks by himself and with doggy friends. Peyton has a sensitive stomach and is currently doing great eating Zignature Turkey kibble. Peyton is 80lbs and a tall build and he will need a handler that his fit, and steady on his/her feet, as he continues to learn good manners. Peyton's ideal adopter will have prior GSD experience and will continue his training -with positive reinforcement methods- (sit and wait, not jumping up, not mouthing, etc...). Payton will need a kind, patient adopter who understands he needs a little extra time to adjust, and who will allow him the personal space and time he needs to warm up on his own terms. He is a fabulous boy and a diamond in the rough, who will reward his lucky adopter with many years of happiness.Like all German Shepherds, Peyton would make a great addition to an active home that will provide the love, structure, good leadership, activity and mental stimulation that he needs. Because of that, Peyton's ideal owner will have prior GSD, or similar breed experience. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, please remember that you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings, in order to provide sufficient stimulation, ward off boredom, and work on leash skills, and manners. This boy is a diamond in the rough. He is going to make the right adopter very happy!\nPeyton's adoption fee is $275 all of which goes back into offsetting our high-cost vetting expenses and rescuing more dogs.

            "description": "Please read Blairs story in full before submitting an application. You can also see videos and more pictures of her on our Facebook page, Rescue Row. Blair was welcomed into Rescue Row after we were contacted by a family who found their dog limp and bleeding. Blair had been attacked by another dog and shaken like a rag-doll.\n\nWe rushed her to the vet and x-rays showed that her spine was broken, which paralyzed her. After a couple weeks of healing, she began water therapy, walking in a wheelchair, and acupuncture in hopes of getting her up and walking again. Although she has made great progress, she still cannot fully walk 100% of the time. Surgery has been ruled out by a CT scan, but we are hoping with time she will end up being able to walk a little more each week. We are looking for an adopter who will continue working with her. We are unsure if she will ever walk again, but we are not giving up on her. She needs an adopter that either works from home or is home the majority of the time. Also an adopter that is able to carry her and lift her up on the couch and back down, she weighs 14 lbs. She loves going on car rides and her foster Mom tries to take her everywhere she can. She loves everyone she meets, but is very attached to her foster Mom so she will need an understanding adopter to allow her time to warm up in a new environment. No kids under the age of 14. She loves kids, but we do not want to take the chance that she could be dropped and re-injure her spine. Per Wisdom Panel she is 50% Chihuahua/12.5% Miniature Poodle/12.5% Yorkie/25% Mixed Breed groups. She is completely kennel trained, but needs to be carried outside and helped to go potty. She still does not have complete control of her bladder, so her adopter needs to be ok with accidents. Blair does not know she is different then the other dogs in the home and is such a happy and loving girl.\n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91767055990166 \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex. We are dedicated to rescuing dogs in shelters, dogs in abusive or neglectful situations, and dogs surrendered by their owners because of difficult circumstances. We place dogs in loving, responsible, committed permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process, which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a dog into their homes and lives. Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, microchipped, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment, and placed in nurturing foster homes while they await placement in their permanent homes. We assist dogs in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. Dogs in the greatest need take priority. Finally, we strive to work with shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless dogs.",

            "description": "Oh-oh-oh, get in the action\nFeel the attraction!\n\nLittle miss Shania Twain says she will be singing a happy tune and dancing a happy dance if a wonderful Colorado family brings her home to love.\n\nSweet sweet Miss Shania is a three month old, Australian Sheppard mix puppy that just recently arrived in Colorful Colorado. So thrilled she was to have arrived in Colorado, she began running zoomies in the yard the moment her paws hit the grass.\n\nShania has been sleeping in a large cozy crate near her foster mama. Shania is just as excited for bedtime as her foster mama and happily runs ahead and into her crate at bedtime. Shania not only knows her routine, she also knows her foster mamas routine. As soon as Shania sees foster mama put on hand lotion, she knows the next step is to trot off to bed and she runs along ahead and into her crate. Shana likes to adjust her bedding of towels and blankets to make herself a little nest. Shania makes it the whole night, about 8 hours, before needing to go outside. Her first order of business when getting up in the morning is running down two flights of stairs and out to the yard to take care of her morning toiletries.\n\nShania has worked hard on house training and rarely has an accident. Accidents primarily occur because foster mama failed to notice her need or get the door open fast enough in the morning. Shania is even good at sitting by the door to alert her foster mama that she needs to go out. She may also whimper softly. Shanias foster mama has learned to trust Shanias communication. Foster mama also takes her out often just to reinforce her good behavior and give her ample opportunities to take care of business.\n\nShania loves to play and be around her people that she has bonded with. However, Shania is shy at first with new people and dogs. At first, Shania got a little spooked by unfamiliar noises, but she is feeling more confident and even starting to run closer to those folks and dogs that wish to greet her at the fence. Shania has made a couple of doggie friends at the fence and seems only to want to play.\n\nShania is a high energy puppy that desires attention and playtime. We have been taking a short walk every day and she is adjusting to the new activity. Some days go better than others and she may be willing to venture a little further on each walk. Other days she would prefer to turn back toward home. Foster mama is puzzled at times because Shania gets so excited when the leash comes out but then doesnt want to walk. We are working on this skill and trying to determine what triggers her fear of going out. Shania and foster mama play catch with soft toys and this girl can catch! Perhaps a future frisbee dog in the making?\n\nShania knows the sit command and learned very quickly. She has even been working on sit, stay, come, and doing well. However, she needs special attention to learning that feet and toes, fingers, and clothes are not appropriate chew toys. That behavior is still a work in progress.\n\nMiss Shania has beautiful green eyes and a fine white fur coat with brown spots. She has the cutest brown patch of fur that highlights her bright green eye and another that surrounds her cute little nose.\n\nCan you feel it?\nCome, come, come on, baby!\nI feel like I could be your happy puppy!\n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

She gets along with both male and female humans, dogs and cats. She is currently learning what it means to live in a home and use a potty pad and go outside. Leash- what's that? She does resource guard. Isabella loves to play with her stuffed toys so make sure she's got an assortment to choose from. Isabella is timid and likes to make the first move, so take it slow when getting acquainted.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Isabella is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the animalss foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each pet, based on the pets needs. If you and the pet are not a good match, we will help you select another, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

Thank you!\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster-based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

He has a great attitude, and brings joy to everyone that crosses his path. \n\nHe LOVES people and would do anything for a home where he could be someone's everyday side-kick! \n\nHe is house trained, crate trained, and is working on his basic-advanced obedience.\n\nHe is currently in a foster home with his trainer @dogtrainerari and she is working him through his training program with @woofgangrehab and @shadesofbludogtraining.\n\nHe is doing extremely well will his foster fur-brother @artook9gsd and we believe he will do great with another dog to share a home with but he will have to meet any new siblings before adoption to ensure a good match. \n\nWe pulled this adorable guy from the humane society where he had previously been rather unlucky. He has been returned to the shelter by multiple families, all of whom were either moving, not ready for a dog, and at one point he was left at a day care and the owner did not return for him. \n\nBecause he has been moved around so much we will be very selective with his new forever home to ensure that he never have to go through the stress of being abandoned again.\n\nKnowing all this, you can see that Dipstick is a very special boy, even after all of the neglect this pup has faced, he still has such a positive outlook on life, and is happy to be around anyone and go anywhere with an over-sized smile on his face! \n\nDipstick is currently available for meet and greets and adoption but will only move into his forever home when his training is complete! \n\n\nPlease view information about our rescue and mission on at following link before applying:\n\nhttps://shadesofbludogtraining.com/rescue/woof-gang-rehab-rescue/\n\n\n\nTo apply for your new best friend, please fill out our online application! \n\nhttps://shadesofbludogtraining.com/rescue/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Hello there! My name is Gertie! I am part Border Collie and part Lab; which makes me a Borador! I am about 10 months old and currently weigh 51 lbs. I could use a few groceries though, as I am rather skinny. My foster parents think I will probably be about 65 lbs once I'm done growing and at a healthy weight. I have been with my foster family since January 24th and have had no accidents in the house and sleep quietly through the night in my kennel. I am very gentle and don't jump up on people. I am currently an only dog in my foster home, but am friendly with other dogs I've met at the rescue and on walks. I'm working on not barking at dogs I see while I'm on walks, but it's just because I'm so excited and want to go play with them. I'm also working on not whining when we walk by people, which is me just being upset they didn't come pet me. I sit for my food and am very smart so I should pick up new commands quickly. I enjoy my squeaky toys, chewing on bones, playing in snow, and cuddling with my foster parents. I am medium energy and match the energy of my foster parents. I am calm in the house, but am very active outside. I am not good with cats. I am a sweet girl looking for my furever home!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application.

I\u2019m the opposite of shy and I jump right into whatever we\u2019re doing! I love chasing toys and playing with my foster sister but I also love to snuggle on the couch. If you\u2019re not giving me enough attention I\u2019ll nudge your hand onto my head for some extra pets. I take directions well and I\u2019m learning fast. I sleep through the night and I do so in my crate without making a peep! I haven\u2019t had any house accidents so foster mom is very impressed considering I\u2019m definitely still a puppy. I walk well on a leash without pulling but could use some training on walk etiquette unless you don\u2019t mind my zig zagging (there\u2019s just so many smells!) I don\u2019t make very much noise but I\u2019m good at letting you know what I want! I also do incredibly well on car rides but you should keep me in the back seat or I\u2019ll try to crawl in your lap for cuddles.

            "description": "MEET GILLY!!\n\nTHIS DOG IS SLATED FOR EUTHANASIA by the County Shelter-- NEEDS IMMEDIATE FOSTER/ADOPTER.\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in it's possession. He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4526063.\n\nOne of the saddest reasons a dog can be E-listed is because they are mentally breaking down in their kennel. This is what's happened to me. I am really struggling and it is inhumane to keep me here in this condition....Can someone save my life?\n\nI am a young 2 year old pup looking for a foster or my furever home. Aren't I a handsome boy? My bio says I need to be the only dog. My first day in the play yard I growled at another dog, the next day I tolerated some dogs and allowed sniffing. So maybe I'm just dog selective? If you are interested in me and currently have dogs, bring them down so I can meet them! I'm very friendly with all people, I just need to get out of this shelter, it's not the place for me! I pull moderately hard on my leash and I bite it sometimes because I'm so excited, I will need a patient owner who will work on my training. I jump and get excited to see people, so it's best I don't go to a home with young children. It is possible some of these behaviors subside outside of the stressful shelter environment. Do you have room in your home for me?\n\nTo meet me, please call 480 331 4188 or message us here. If you have a dog you need to bring down for a dog intro. Dog Savers has got over 230 E-listed dogs in the last year out of the shelter alive! A small percent of the donations go to our operating costs to help these dogs get out alive. Lets keep working together to save lives!!\n\nMy ID is #A4526063...you'll need that if you want to save me. I am located in Phoenix Az.\n\n#shelterdogs #phoenix #dogsofinstagram #adopt #shelterdogsrock #bugtotherescue #whosavedwho #onedogatatime #pitbull #pit #pitbullsofinstagram #adoptdontshop #doglife #cute #doglover #lovemydog #dogsofig #pet #mutt #rescue #rescuedog #rescuedogsofinstagram #FindYourFido #MaricopaCountyAnimalCareAndControl #TagYourWag #petadoption #adoptionistheonlyoption #adoptadog #rescueme\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.",

Pico is about 4 years old and weighs 5 pounds. He is a fun little mix - our best guess is yorkie and terrier or chihuahua but there is probably all 3 or more in there. He has a long scruffy coat that can get out of control if not kept up on.\n\nPico is normally a little couch potato! He likes to be in his crate, all snuggled up with another little dog. He is happy just lounging around all day. He is normally a quiet boy but if there is any fun going on he becomes Sherriff Pico and wants to end it. There is no rough housing around him! He is working on his housetraining skills but will need more work in his new home so please be patient with him. His foster mom started working with him on the leash but he prefers the freedom of his fully fenced yard! Pico is good with other dogs and would like one in his new home. He sometimes barks at cats but it doesn't go further than that. He has not been tested with kids so at this point, he should be around kids 13+. Pico was initially very scared for his foster mom and didn't want to be picked up. After lots of work, Pico is ready to be picked up and will roll over for a belly rub. He may regress a bit in a new home with new people but once he feels secure, he will come around. Pico is a gentle little boy who's life was turned upside down when his family gave him up. All he wants is a loving home again!\n\nPico is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and tested neg. for heartworm. He has also been groomed recently! His adoption fee is $400",

Chive is such a good boy who loves to play with the other dogs in his foster home and even gets along with the cat:) Chive needs a home where someone is at home a good portion of the day even after COVID. Chive is good on leash, loves going for walks and is a snuggler. Chive is suited to homes with kids 8 years and up. Chive is not suited to apartment/condo living. Chive is neutered, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines, and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nIf you would like to meet Chive, please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com\n\nIf you are viewing this on PetFinder or other venue, please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org",

Our adoption center is located next to CAL Ranch at 232 North Jones (I-95) Suite 170.    \n\nSay hello to Willie, a young at heart boy who is almost 5 years old.  Willie will need a secure yard to run and play so that he can get his daily exercise, but he also wants to enjoy family time with his humans.  We are still learning about Willie, we will update as more info becomes available.  \n\nHe needs a home where he can be the only 4 legged love of your life and no children/teens under 16 yrs old.  More will be known about me soon.   \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events at our Adoptions Store,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd, Suite 170  right next to CAL Ranch (North Jones/ I-95).   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet. \n\nIf you are interested in Willie, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular event.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nWillie is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.

Anna is simply the cutest girl, with the cutest wiggle! Anna is a happy lady, who is excited to be with and near people! She looks forward to going for walks and really enjoys play time. Anna came to the Shelter after being found running the streets, all by her self! Thankfully, her disposition is one of an elated girl. She deserves to be in a loving home where she is well tended to and cared for !\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336753 (female), and 336619 (male). She was very vocal, but there were no red flags as far as posturing. Do recommend slow introductions to other dogs because of her exuberant voice 1/20/2021\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated**\n\n Primary Color: Blue Secondary Color: White Weight: 61lbs Age: 1yrs 6mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

I'm so excited to see you and play, that I tend to get in others personal space. My education has been a little lacking, but if you're ready to teach and have yummy treats, I'm ready to learn. With time and patience, I can show you just how smart I could be! I need a home where all kids are closer to school age. I need to meet all family and any other dogs in the home. I'm not a fan of felines (and they may not be a fan of me), so I'll need a home without cats. Blue will be shown by appointment only.

Max is a very sweet little dude who enjoys meeting new human friends. He has gone through lots of stressful experiences in a pretty short amount of time. He hopes to find a family that'll let him take his time adjusting to his new life and set him up to succeed. Max would benefit greatly from attending structured training classes with his people, so both him and his humans can learn important life skills and tricks in a positive and fun environment. Max is best suited to live with older kids aged 12, who are respectful and have dog experience. Max will do best as the only pet in the home, as he gets a little TOO excited around kitties and other dogs. Max is heartworm positive and is currently a foster-to-adopt candidate. \nHave an inquiry?

Roxie was relinquished to the shelter due to her medical needs.  She is a sweet dog and has been and absolute champ about taken her medications and daily insulin injections. Please don\u2019t let this  frighten or deter you from wanting to meet her.    PWD will help continue to assist her adoptive family  with her medical needs if needed.   \n\nRoxie was fostered by an incredible person before being transported to us and  she has a lot of great things to say about this girl:\n\n\"Roxie is a sweet girl that absolutely loves people. She affectionately got the nickname \"Potato\" as she is a couch potato at heart but does enjoy going for walks and being outdoors. Her absolute favorite place to be though is in your lap. The few times she was around my 2-year-old nephew she was very gentle, and when he realized she couldn't find the ball as easily as our other dogs he would put it right in front of her and she would gently take it from him.   She is great with other animals as well. She enjoyed the quiet company of my 4 cats and would occasionally be found cuddling with them in bed. She enjoyed being around my dogs as well and would play on days she was feeling spunky but otherwise just enjoyed their company.\"\n\n \nPlease consider Roxie,  she would be a great companion and friend.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

Because I am so excited to meet you, I may jump up to say hello. But I am very smart and believe a few sessions of obedience training will help me kick that habit. We aren't sure how I will be with children due to my size and occasional jumping, so a home with older children or no children would be best. I know a few cool tricks like sit and stay, and I am eager to learn more! I am an active guy and I love car rides, so I would love to live with an active owner who will take me on many adventures! I can't wait to meet you!",

She didn't understand being walked on a leash when she first arrived. She is gradually learning what that is all about.\n\nDue to her timid ways, she is best in a home without young children as she is easily intimated.

            "description": "From the mean streets of San Francisco to the safety of Muttville, this little chihuahua mix comes with a \"little big man\" outlook on life. Quigley seems to have come from a tough life and looks forward to a forever home with a family who will love and accept him for all his quirks and complexities. \n\nQuigley is a bit of a lone wolf and is happiest doing his own thing. He likes to have his head and back scratched as long as it on his terms. He's a good eater and is very good about gently taking snacks from those he knows/trusts. \n\nHere is what his foster has to say:\n\nQuigley's favorite thing to do is to lie out in the sun with occasional breaks inside for water and a cool-down. Quigley likes short walks but does tire after 15-20 minutes. He loves riding in a stroller where he can observe other dogs and people rather than encounter them.\n\nWe're working on his house training and he's made great strides! He understands potty pads and although has been wearing a belly band, he's been fine during the day with no accidents! He's happiest in the morning and has even been known to \"play a game of hide and seek up and down the hall. In the evening, after dinner and a walk, Quigs wants to get in his bed and stay there uninterrupted until morning. \n\nThough he can manage the two steps at his foster home, he'd probably be happiest in a single story home/apartment. Quigley is best suited for a quiet and mature household. He will definitely do best with a family that has had experience with fearful dogs, understanding that patience and love will help Quigley bloom!\n\nQuigley is a super cute little guy who is fairly independent. He enjoys being near his people and other dogs, but also likes his space. His favorite activity is going out for his walks as he loves a good sniffari! He can walk happily for about 15 minutes. After that he won't complain about staying outside, but sitting in a stroller. \n\nOur guess is that Quigley hasn't had the best past sadly. One vet said \"he's been in a lot of pain for a very long time\" - but we are helping to change that! He's had a dental, had an infected eye removed, and even had a little toe fixe. It takes him a while to warm up to people and trust them. He is not super snuggly and doesn't want to be fussed over, however he loves to know you are there and will sit in his own bed in the same room with you. He sometimes will even sit next to you on the sofa, but he's not a lap dog. \n\nHe is looking for a very special person who understands his independence and is looking for a companion that is not needy. Quigley deserves just as much love and compassion as any other dog and we cannot wait for him to find his person. Are you that person who just wants to help a dog in need and not ask anything in return? If so then Quigley is your guy. His fans at Muttville can see the shining light behind that eye and really want to help him find a home that is going to understand his needs and help him to trust that humans aren't as terrible as he once knew them to be...\n\nQuigley's Adoption fee is being sponsored by The Farmer's Dog!",

SHE WILL BITE/SNAP IF BEING HANDLED, PICKED UP, ETC. UNTIL SHE COMPLETELY TRUSTS YOU**\n\nIF YOU JUST WANT A COMPANION AND LOVE A CHALLENGE THEN SHES YOUR GIRL\n\nIF YOU WANT A LAP DOG CUDDLE BUDDY SHE IS NOT YOUR GIRL UNTIL SHE COMPLETE TRUSTS YOU WHICH COULD BE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD\n\nShirley Temple needs a home where she will be given time to adjust due to her trust issues. She needs an adopter that is dog savvy and is able to handle her spiciness. When she comes out of her shell she is like The Good Ship Lollipop taking off to candy land. She has a bubbly personality that will put a smile on your face. This goofy and silly girl will keep you on your dance toes so an active lifestyle would be ideal. She would prefer a fenced yard so she can work on her dance skills and get her zoomies out. She is still working on her potty skills and prefers not to be in a crate.\n\nShe is sweet in her own right and likes to be petted on her terms.\n\n** A HOME WITH A FENCED  YARD IS A MUST **\n\n\nAdoption fee is $300 with approved adoption application which includes age appropriate shots, rabies, spay/neuter, micro chip, heart worm test (treated if positive) started on monthly prevention if negative. Dental if needed as well as any other medical necessities. Comes with goody bag of toys, treats, collar, leash, etc. Also comes with 1 month (30 days) of free doggie health insurance.\n\nNOTE: We do not adopt outside of a 75 mile radius of our location\nNOTE: This dog would not be suited for Town home, Condo or Apartment living.\nNOTE: We do not adopt to families with children under the age of 7",

He does not care what you do to him; he has so much trust in us.\n\nDolby would do best in a home with lots going on and many friends Primary Color: Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 41lbs Age: 1yrs 6mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

I'll do best in a home that has plenty of room and a fenced yard. Daily exercise and obedience training will help make me a happy, well-mannered dog. Please take me to the park, on hikes, and on morning jogs with you!\n\nFrom: Animal Control\nWeight: 43 lbs\nExercise: High Energy\nLarge/Small dogs: I like to play with other dogs. I do have lots of energy and may be too much for older dogs. You can always bring in your dog(s) to visit with me.\nChildren: I have lots of energy and forget my manners sometimes. Please bring the whole family in to make sure I'm the right fit for you.\nCats/other small animals: Unknown, ask an adoption counselor about doing a cat test with me.\n Primary Color: Brown Brindle W/white Weight: 43.6lbs Age: 2yrs 1mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

Best suited to a home without children as he can be quite bashful.\n\nRequirements: Will need consistent obedience training, appropriate socialization, extra enrichment, and adequate exercise.\n\nSex: Male\n \nAge: Adult- 1 year old\n\nEnergy Level: High\n\nStrength Level: High\n\nWalks Best With: Freedom Harness\n\nWorking On: General manners & not jumping up on people.\n\nIntake Reason: Stray\n\nMore About this Pet: I'm a big blockhead boy who loves to play with toys and go for long walks! Once I get to know you, I give the best hugs and slobbery kisses. I had a difficult past, so sometimes meeting new people and dogs can make me a little nervous and overwhelmed.\n\nIf you want to adopt me, you'll have to come meet me at the shelter first and bring your dog (if you have one) to see if we like each other. Despite being over 80 pounds, I'm just a big, gentle giant and couch potato. I am a dream to walk on leash and I don't pull at all. I know how to stick right by your side. I promise to be your loyal best friend for life if you give me a chance. Our behavior team will be happy to tell you all about me. I can't wait to get out of here and go to my forever home!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting this pet, click the [Adopt me] button to apply. \nFind a link to adopt this pet on our website: https://www.mdspca.org/humane-care/adopt/ \n Primary Color: Brown Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 75.4lbs Age: 1yrs 1mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

THE VIDEO OF ZINNIA'S NEW BEGINING! \n*********************************************\nTHE TUCSON COMMUNITY RALLIED TOGETHER TO SAVE THIS YOUNG MOTHER THAT WAS DUMPED IN THE DESERT!!!\n Yes!!!! Right before Christmas, lactating Zinnia was dumped in the desert by the side of the road where she stayed for days waiting for that familiar car that Never returned! A DEDICATED group of women tried desperately to gain her trust but she only wanted that car!\nAfter a week she began to roam through the desert with her Rescue Angels hot on her trail..sightings were posted on NEXT-DOOR and  at all hours of the day and night these gals never gave up! They borrowed a professional trap that they constantly moved when she did with life saving food and water! After 3 long weeks....it was Zinnia's Lucky Day thanks to some smelly cat food! The Rescue Angels took her to the HSSAZ where the veterinarians removed cactus from her mouth and body and the Fabulous, Rachel Molyneux from Sol Dog Lodge & Training Center picked her up yesterday and Zinnia's New Life Begins!; Zinnia has had a rough 2 months To Say The Least....and will be in board & train at Sol Dog until she is ready for adoption!!!!\n* If you would like to donate to Zinnia's recovery you can do so directly at: https://soldoglodge.com/donate/ and specify to Zinnia's Care  Special Thanks to Roxanne Washington for\n   NEVER GIVING UP ON ZINNIA!\n\n        IT TAKES A VILLAGE!!!\n\nSTAY TUNED FOR PHOTOS AND UPDATES!\nZINNIA WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON FOR ADOPTION AT SMILINGDOGRESCUE.COM",

I have been working hard to master house training but am amazing when crated! Time to get serious about us and fill out that application!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals.

Hes not a fan of the cold weather, so we are working on his potty training, but he does well with the potty pads. He does great on walks but needs a little extra coaxing because of the cold. He would like to live with another small dog if possible, and is very sweet and likes attention!\n\nDue to the current events, the rescue is not able to host adoption events.  Please fill out an application and we will conduct phone interviews and set up outdoor meet and greets! www.thegooddogrescue.org\n\nHis adoption fee is $250 and he is Neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations",

He is such a happy boy and his tail never stops wagging. He is very energetic for a 10 year-old. His love for food has made him on the chubby side at 33 pounds, so he is on a diet plan. He loves food so much that he will bark for what you have, but with a little training, this can improve. Sometimes he also will whine initially when he is left alone, but he settles down after a short time. Kippie gets along well with dogs and people. He is house-, crate- and leash trained, but does pull while on the leash because he is so eager to smell everything. His favorite pastime is playing with his ball, chewing on his bones and hanging with his family.Unfortunately, Kippie is heartworm positive so he needs to be with a family on the Mississippi Gulf Coast so he can continue treatment with the same vet. Also, he will have to remain quiet during his treatment and for a few months afterwards. Kippie is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped. His adoption fee is $175. Available through Tired Dog Rescue, Gulfport, MS. If you would love to give this wonderful boy a forever home, please apply at tireddogrescue.org",

He is 2 and a half years old, current on shots, now neutered, and a big handsome fella! He\u2019s strong and weighs almost 90 pounds so he needs a handler understands his strength and size. He is a love of a pup and misses his home life setting. Maybe you have the most amazing FOREVER home for Buddy?! Visit with him today and adopt him into your heart and home!\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

After searching for the momma dog for 2 hours in the cold rain, we came up empty. \n\nWithout the momma dog around, we, ourselves, have had to become the \u201cmom\u201d!! This means buying puppy milk replacement, cleaning, bathing, and bottle feeding all 8 puppies!!\n\nBrandi is now old enough to find her forever home!!

            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Hercules! His owner surrendered him to another shelter and we offered to help him since we had some space. He came into our shelter January 19, 2021 and is now current on shots, and awaiting his chance at a happily ever after. Hercules is 4 years old and a happy boy full of happiness and love to share. He\u2019s a bundle of energy and excitement and would love a home with a big fenced in yard to run around in BUT he loves his people and wants to soak up all the TLC and affection one has to give too. A real sweetheart for sure!! Might you have the most amazing loving FOREVER home for this charming 64 pound hunk of love?! Visit with him today! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

            "description": "Hi guys, I\u2019m Moira a 43 lbs, 1 year old female terrier mix.  I made my way up to Wisconsin from Oklahoma to find my forever home.  One thing I can say is I\u2019m not  a fan of this cold.  I\u2019m working on my potty training (I will get there soon) but as soon as I go outside, I will quick do my business because my butt wants to get back into the house where it\u2019s nice and warm.  Speaking of my butt, it NEVER stops wiggling.  NEVER!  My foster mom says I have to be one of the happiest dogs she has met and I love meeting new people.  When someone new comes to the house, I\u2019m the first one to greet them at the door like they are my long lost friend.  I also very much enjoy the 3 resident dogs that live here with me.  We play a lot!  There also is a resident cat here that I\u2019m a little interested in...I think she wants to be my friend but sometimes I get a little to excited when I see her that I think she wants me to chase her.  I guess she doesn\u2019t like that to much.  I\u2019m also starting to learn that my crate isn\u2019t to bad, I will cry some at the beginning and then I will just give up and lay down.  \nI haven\u2019t been around any small children yet.  My foster mom thinks I would do best with ones that were a little older.  I give so many kisses because I love kisses but sometimes those kisses will turn into nibbles.  I just love humans so much that I get a little excited and forget that I need to be gentle.  I do listen when I\u2019m reminded though.\nI would love a family that will give my lots of attention and play fun games with.  I can be a little antsy when no one is paying attention to me and I will pace back and fourth.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

They are all safe now and looking for their forever homes. She appears to be about 2-3 years old and a German Shepherd/Husky mix. We call her Yotey because she looked like a coyote out there in the desert, but she is an extremely sweet dog. She had a companion who has already been adopted so we think she would do best in a home where she would have another dog to pal around with. She is playful yet calm and just an all around fantastic dog! \n\nPlease do NOT call or email. The first step in the process is for you to completely fill out the adoption application in the link below. If your application is incomplete, we will move on to the next one. \n\nDue to Covid-19 we are conducting the home checks virtually. So once you have submitted your application, please take photos and/or video of your home, front and back yards, fencing, gates, other pets in your home, where this pet would be sleeping, etc. Then compose an email, attach the photos, and in the subject line of the email please put \"Your Full Name (as it appears on the application you submitted) - the name of the pup you applied for\". This will help us to match your email to your application in our software. Send the email to infosatg@gmail.com and an adoption counselor will review them and contact you if you have met these conditions. ;)\n\nPlease understand that we are all unpaid volunteers with our own families, pets, and jobs to attend to it is just not possible to respond to every single person all the time. We do the best we can and appreciate your understanding. (Tip: The more thorough you are in answering the questions on our application and in your \"virtual home tour\", the more likely it is that you will be contacted. :)\n\nApply to adopt Yotey at: \nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/SATG-A-129",

Please go to www.wowdogrescue.org for any updates.\n\nScrappy is a little boy with a lot of curiosity, and high energy.\nHe was a stray.\nWe think he is around 1.5 yrs old and weighs in around 9 lbs.\nPerhaps a Terrier/chihuahua mix.\nHe has learned to walk on a leash and needs the exercise. He knows what the\nharness is and will stand so you can put it on him.\n\nScrappy's self confidence is low and he is afraid of fast movements and loud sounds.He is not a candidate for car rides, as they make him\nsick to his stomach.\nHe likes and needs a lot of positive reinforcement.\nHe is very gentle even when he is afraid he will not growl or try to bite. (He just crouches down).\n\nHe LOVES to cuddle on the couch but on his terms.\nHis preference for a new owner would be a woman.\nScrappy is crate trained, house breaking is a on-going challenge for him but has greatly improved.\n(Perhaps once his neuter is done this will improve).\n\nHe is great with other dogs, and would benefit from another dog in the home, but he has adjusted well.\nHe loves soft chew toys and his blanket.\nHe is not foods aggression and has put on some needed weight.\nThe fosters feed him 2 times a day but would most likely be fine free feeding.\n\nHe will Be neutered on 1/22/21, and also be microchipped, Rabies shot, and has already had his DHPP and Bordetella shot.\n\nScrappy's adoption fee is $250.00\n\nWe are NOT Petfinder,\nWe are not Adoptapet,\nOR\nRescue me.\n\nOur application is on OUR website:  www.wowdogrescue.org\n\n**PLEASE do not call to see if he is \"still\" available.\nHis Gallery photo on our website will be updated daily and will state his status.\nIF we have chosen someone, he will be marked \"Pending\".\nIF he has been adopted, he will be marked \"Adopted\".\n\n***Tired of not finding, or not being chosen for the dog of your dream??\nConsider Fostering with us...Our Fosters have 1st chance at adopting the dog they foster, while we pay for everything.\nIts a win win for both!

I am required to meet all household residents, including dogs, before going to my forever home. I am not suitable for apartments. Rover will be shown by appointment only.

I might not have those famous hips like my namesake, but I still know how to shake, rattle and roll! With a goofball personality like mine, it's hard to keep from wiggling with excitement when I see my human friends - I'm all shook up! I promise that life with me will never be boring. I know some basic commands already, like sit and lay down, so I'm well on my way to becoming an upstanding K-9 citizen. And I can't resist a good cuddle session, so if you're lonesome tonight, just let me be your teddy bear, cuz' I can't help falling in lovewith you! So don't be cruel and come adopt me, it's now or never! :) I'm a sponsored Dolly's Dream dog. Adopt me and we'll go home together with an ID tag, leash, collar, harness, training crate, dog bed, toys, training treat bag, food and water bowls and 7 months of pet insurance. Wow, huh?! Lots of goodies for you and me, and even a waived adoption fee! Meet with an Adoption Coordinator to learn more.",

She follows her foster mom around the house and likes to sit with her head on her lap. She loves belly rubs and attention and would do great as an only dog. Pumpkin is also very intrigued with the TV and loves to watch it with you. This sweetheart is low energy and very affectionate. She walks really well on the leash but sometimes gets scared and needs some encouragement. Overall, she is a very good girl looking for a patient and loving family to help her come out of her shell!\n\nPumpkin is full of love! She is looking for a forever home where she can get lots of belly rubs and can give all the kisses!\n\nInterested in adding Pumpkin to your family? Apply online today!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available!

            "description": "Meet Thatcher! We believe this puppy is a terrier mix, about 3 months old, and weighs about 8 pounds. He wants to play all day long, carrying around plush toys and keeping them all with him in his crate. This little guy loves sitting in his crate or under furniture. It's not uncommon to turn around and find a set of eyes watching you from under the couch or bed.\n\nThatcher is still learning his way in the world. He's crate trained, mostly housebroken, and is still getting used to leash walking. Once he gets comfortable with you, he is very engaging and fun, and will chew all the treats he can get. Thatcher is dog friendly and likes people, but takes longer to open up to men.\n\nThis sweetheart is looking for his forever home! Is it yours?\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

I am a very friendly little girl who really loves to play with other dogs of all sizes. My sweet and calm temperament would lend me well to a home with young children and I even think that I could get along well with a feline friend in the home. I'd be a great pick for a first-time dog owner and could see me being very happy in a variety of different types of home living environments, whether it's an apartment or a home with a big yard. I absolutely need some continued training to help me become the very best dog possible, but I do appear to be house-broken. If you're looking for a pup who could join you on your daily adventures in public, I may be just the girl for you!",

            "description": "Spade is a very sweet boy who is terribly traumatized. We don't know what he's been though, but we know it must have been horrible. Spade wants very badly to trust, but it will take a very special person and a lot of TLC for him to become the dog he's meant to be. We want to be very transparent about the fact that he is extremely shut down. Spade will need someone extremely patient and understanding while he decompresses and settles into a home. It may take months before he begins to come out of his shell and become comfortable with people - the timeline is different for every dog. We are hoping to find an adopter experienced in socializing fearful dogs. Please understand that Spade's journey will not be an easy one and will require a significant commitment. Spade is 40lbs and estimated to be 12yrs old. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. His adoption fee is donation based. Please go to www.angelsretreat.org to apply.",
