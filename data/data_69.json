            "description": "Why hello there! My name is Sophie.  I have a lot of great features that make ME FAB-U-LOUS!! I am calm, I pay no attention to the cats I live with, I\u2019m okay with other dogs, I do great in the car and I have beautiful big brown eyes.  In fact, I am fully potty trained\u2026would you believe have not had one accident while in rescues care???  I know sit and take treats extremely gently.  If people are petting me and they stop I will nudge them with my paw to let them know they need to continue with those pets!  My favorite activity is to eat.  I don\u2019t understand why my foster parents can\u2019t prepare breakfast or dinner any faster! I dance, I hop and I spin when I know my food is coming.  I love to get food from my wobbler and puzzle.  I have been to the family barn and enjoyed seeing all the interesting animals there.  I have also met other dogs and I pay them no attention.  My foster parents say that I do excellent on a leash too\u2026I do not pull.  When they stop walking I then stop walking too-when they start walking again I do as well. \n\nAlthough I love to eat it is also my downfall.  We all have a downfall or two right??  I need to lose weight to help me with my legs and be in overall better health.  You see I\u2019m an older girl (8) and my joints are stiff with arthritis and an old ACL tear\u2026..so I\u2019m a bit slower and had some trouble walking. But don\u2019t worry!! I am on anti-inflammatory and pain medication- my walking has improved greatly.  I get short walks throughout the day and get 1 longer walk.  I am getting better with wrinkle & tail pocket cleanings, and ear medication but I still need work\u2026.sometimes I will run away from my foster parents.  I came into rescue with two severely infected ears.  After getting a culture and proper treatment my ears are doing much better however they will need life long care & maintenance.\n\nSophie's Adoption Fee is $450\n\nIf you would like to donate to Sophie's care, please go to our website at http://shopcebr.com/products/donation.\n\n\nHOW TO QUALIFY FOR A CEBR BULLY To determine if you qualify to adopt one of our adorable bullies start by viewing our Adoption Area Map.

I would do best in a home with a fenced in yard and dog savvy people who can help me feel safe and secure. Any potential adopters would need to come to the shelter and meet me multiple times to gain my trust. I would also need a home without children or cats. Once I fall for my people I am 100% loyal. I most enjoy spending time with my volunteer friends and going for walks. I can also be a big goof-ball! I turn in circles and wiggle my whole butt when I want your attention!",

At approximately 4 years old, Ody is sweet and gentle but ready to play!  Ody is a gorgeous red and white hound-mix.  He is a happy, smiley boy in spite of his rough start in life. Ody has completed his heart worm treatment and heads north 1/30!\n\nPlease note: Little Black Dog Rescue is a FOSTER BASED rescue based in Fairfield County, Connecticut. We do NOT have a facility where you can come meet the dogs. We do adoption events every few months but primarily work one-on-one with each applicant to match the right dog to the right family. Once your application is received, all questions can be answered. We currently adopt to homes along the East Coast of the United States.  The adoption fee ranges from $250-$525 depending on age of the dog and transport distance/cost.\n\nPlease go to our website at www.littleblackdogrescue.org to see more information and to fill out our online application. Applications are required before conversations about potential matches can begin. Please check our website for up to date availability.\n\nWe are a non-profit organization and the adoption fee goes towards the transport, vetting, spay/neuter and boarding needs of the dogs we rescue. LBDR is a small rescue that receives a minor discount on vetting unlike larger rescues who self-administer or receive volume discounts. LBDR focuses on the rescue, care and placement of black dogs who are in danger of euthanasia due to their color, as well as other dogs who are in immediate need. LBDR is funded by donations which are used solely for the care of our dogs.",

This beautiful boy was very shy and scared in the shelter, unable to even walk, but once his fosters brought him home and let him decompress, he started to shine! He is about 1-2 years old, a gorgeous yellow lab, and around 55-60lbs. He's both dog and cat friendly, so he does great with smaller animals, and loves to play. He still gets the puppy zoomies, and his favorite thing to do is carry his stuffed cow or blue hippo around in his mouth! Although he can still scare easily sometimes, especially on walks, he is getting better every day and growing more and more confident and curious. He's so gentle, and loves to cuddle, so we think he would do great in any home!",

She is a people person dog and far more interested in humans than other dogs. She gets on with other dogs, both male and female after proper introductions and she sticks very close to her human and is far more interested in following them around and being as close as she can rather than in what other dogs are doing. She is housetrained and very much recovered from her amputation as she shows no signs of distress and has adapted well to life as a tripod. She has the cutest piggy snores when she is comfortable and is crate trained. Gracie is a very snuggly dog who is happy to be your best friend and would like to come home with you and stay furever.",

She was born 10/15/20; her mom is a scruffy terrier mix and her dad is a gorgeous pit bull with a wonderful disposition. Kaylee loves to meet new people and happily greets them with tail wags and kisses. She enjoys the company of other dogs after she gets to know them a bit. Kaylee is making great progress with house-training and crate-training. She loves to climb, play with toys, and walk in nature. Kaylee's adopter must commit to completing a positive reinforcement-based puppy training class with her, to help her blossom into the best version of herself.",

            "description": "Titus von Tannenbaum is a beautiful, 12 month old Shepherd mix.  This guy is a charming jock, ready to give his all at the starting line and to his people. He needs a coach to channel his enthusiasm. On leash and when meeting his new canine team members, his lively enthusiasm requires some correction (pre-game talk!).  He soon understands what is expected of him, settles down and walks happily in perfect step with a group of other dogs. Off leash in playgroups, Titus is more relaxed and meets and greets male and female dogs with a wagging tail and an invitation to join in the fun. This social and friendly guy is a class act, eager to please and ready to take his position on a good team.No cats please!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "Dancer came to us from a shelter, and we do not know much about her past. She is very shy and nervous but she has made progress in overcoming her fears. We were told that she is a chihauhau mix. Prior to being groomed Dancer had long wirey hair, so we assume part of her mix is terrior. She is approximately 9 years old. She is a tall slender girl, standing 14 inches at her shoulder. She weighs about 12 lbs. She is somewhat thin and could stand to gain some weight so we are working on that. Dancer gets along well with other dogs. She seems to be getting the hang of potty training, and does well if taken out often. She is very unsure of herself on the leash so will need lots of work on that. As her confidence increases she will feel more comfortable on the leash. Dancer would benefit from another dog in the house, as she lacks confidence and feels more confident with another dog. Her new family will need to be patient with her as she learns to trust. She loves to have a massage (who doesn't?) and have her ears and neck scratched. She is starting to get excited when her foster mom returns home from being gone,...and two days ago while she was getting her ears scratched she laid down on the floor and rolled over for a belly rub! \n\nThe requirements for Dancer are: (No Exceptions)\n\n\n\tA fenced in yard yard, as she startles easily and is a flight risk without a fence. \n\tA quiet home with no small children. \n\n\nDancer is spayed, has had her dental appointment, is heartworm negative, and up to date on her shots. Her adoption fee is $250.",

Rory and Lorelai were both surrendered to a Texas shelter and are completed devoted to each other. Where one goes, the other follows. Lorelai believes she is a lap dog and wants nothing more than to give kisses, be with her people and of course hanging out with Rory!\n\nRory and Lorelai have done well around other dogs and older kids. At just 2 years old, Lorelai has great energy and loves nothing more than to run and play till her heart's content. She and Rory love to be out in the yard running, playing, and having the best time! We are not sure that they are the best group for little, little people since they don't yet understand how easily their energy can overwhelm a small child. They may also knock over a little one with the crazy playing. However, an older child they can run and play with? Bring it on!\n\nDuring the day while foster mom is away, they both hang out in their crates and recharge. As long as they are together, they are happy no matter what they are doing. They are both crate trained, and foster mom is working on some obedience training with them. As always, we recommend obedience training for all our rescues to bring out the best in them. With the Belgian shepherd mixes, there is always a good mix of stubborn thrown in with a hefty does of intelligence, so while training is more challenging, watching these girls bloom will be the best reward!\n\nIn the evening, after more afternoon play, Lorelai is excited to snuggle with foster mom on the couch. She loves getting chin scratches and gives kisses in return. Lorelai is a wonderfully affectionate dog and is working to make sure Rory knows everything is Ok.\n\nNuts and Bolts: 2 years old, 50lbs, spayed, good with dogs and older kids, no cats or birds due to Rory's high prey drive, crate trained, potty trained, some obedience training, needs a yard to run.\n\nRory and Lorelai are being fostered in Christiansburg, VA and would love to meet you!\n\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks.\n\nYukon Jack is a young Alaskan Malamute who loves people but needs someone to give him the proper direction in life. Due to Jack exhibiting some resource guarding issues, especially with balls and other round objects, Jack needs some training and a breed experienced owner. He should not live with children. \"Jack\" gets along with both small and medium sized dogs as well as cats. Jack knows sit, stay, speak and down. Jack likes to go for short walks, play in the water and would be the very best lifelong adventure buddy someone can have!! Jack's version of running is a bit ridiculous, he loves to hop like a bunny around the yard, then run a little bit, then goes back to hopping! It is adorable. Jack is a calm, sweet, affectionate, young man!! Jack wants to please his people! Meet Yukon Jack today!!\n\nEmail: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

            "description": "***COVID 19 NOVEMBER 2020 PROTOCOL***\n\nDue to the surge of Covid 19 and statewide restrictions, we are adopting to LOCAL (CLALLAM AND JEFFERSON COUNTY) RESIDENTS ONLY. We are not doing adoptions to Canada at this time due to the border closure. We do not ship animals. \n\nOPHS is appointment only. All potential adopters must fill out an adoption application prior to setting up an appointment to meet the animal. An application can be found on our website  https://www.ophumanesociety.org/dog-adoption-application\n\nWe have limited staff during this time, please allow 3-5 business days for us to process your application. We are screening the applications for the first BEST fit for each animal. \n\nIf you are approved, you will be contacted by us via phone or email to schedule an appointment.\n\nNAME: Luna\nAGE: About 1 year\nWEIGHT: About 50 lbs\nBREED(S): Border Collie and Lab mix\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL: Owner surrender\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY: Luna is a young and energetic girl who is eager to please and ready to learn.\n\nShe has lots of working dog energy paired with just being young. She would make an excellent hiking or running companion and overall adventure buddy. Luna's all time favorite game is playing fetch and she knows how to drop the ball pretty well! \n\nLuna has lived with another young dog and they got along well but would get themselves into trouble by finding ways to escape from their yard. She will need a securely fenced yard as well as someone who will not leave her outside unattended. If she doesn't get enough exercise and training in her new home, she will likely revert back to her bad habits.\n\nAround other dogs, Luna can be somewhat possessive over her toys/ball. Additionally, Luna has shown us reactivity on leash when meeting other dogs and therefore might not be a good fit around every dog. Luna should not be around cats or other small critters. Don't let this sway you though, in the right hands Luna is a sweet girl who really wants to please her people!\n\nActivity Level? High\nTraining Needs? High\nHouse Trained? Yes\nLeash Trained? Yes \nComfortable with kids? Supposedly\nComfortable with strangers? Yes\nHistory with other dogs? Has lived with sibling dog but would be best as only pet. \nHistory with cats? Not good\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: None\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: None\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150 for an adult dog.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.",

A licensing/microchip fee may apply.

He was found living in a culvert on the Navajo Nation near a kind human who discovered him and took him in for a few days until he found his way to Blackhat Humane Society.  \n\nSoren has quickly adjusted to living indoors and loves his foster mom. He is in crate training and is doing well learning to walk on a leash. This little boy is very sweet and is very tuned-in to people and pets around him. He is a character and loves playing with other dogs and is able to entertain himself with toys. Soren is almost cat-like. He loves being loved on and is learning the difference between loving and playing. Soren is fiercely protective and very trainable and like any pup will be an extraordinarily wonderful pet for a family who will continue his training and help him to reach his full potential. ..and, he is a already a great travel companion!\n\nThis boy is being fostered in Ganado, Arizona. For more information or to meet this special sweetheart, contact Lavonne at lyjuhl@yahoo.com.\n\nAlso submit an online application at blackhathumanesociety.org.",

            "description": "Flip Flop is a 1-year old dingus who is looking for an active adult home.    He\u2019s very keyed up at the shelter, so it\u2019s hard for him to settle down and nail his first impressions.  He\u2019s a sweet kiddo and has done well outside the shelter in his foster home.  His foster writes:\nHe is SUCH a sweet and curious boy, wanting to be anywhere we are in the house. There isn\u2019t a mean bone in his body. He loves to snuggle and isn\u2019t shy about laying on top of us when given the chance! Flip Flop loves toys of all kinds- chews, plush, balls, challenge toys and he will entertain himself with toys or respond well to being played with. We limited toys out in the house to 2 as he likes to collect them for himself. He likes to playfully growl and play tug of war. Flip Flop does fine being bathed in an enclosed space as he will try to get out otherwise, and he loves running around in the yard. \nHe does sometimes nibble on various items (blankets, pillows) but responds easily to redirects to dog-approved items. Other than the first day at our house, Flip Flop has only gone potty outside and even has rung the bells on the door a few times to indicate going outside. He sleeps through the night in his crate without any problems at all and barks in the morning when ready to wake up! He has taken to the crate really well if needed when being left alone- No destructive behavior noted at all. He is not well leash trained and pulls heavily on a leash, but Gentle Leader head collar training is starting, as he responded well (other than trying to get it off :)) when we practiced it with our current dog\u2019s Gentle Leader. \nHe follows commands for sit, lay down, and no and usually responds to his name. He does not respond to come, down/off. \u201c",

The 2 female are brindle.\n\nThey were rescued from a flea market - someone abandoned them there - they were weak and with mange; and now they have completed their wellness program and the 3 of them are doing very well and fully recovered.\n\nThey will be medium sizes once full grown.\n\nAs with all rescued fury kids; they are going to need training, love reinforcement; as you know they all come from a tough beginning on their lives and the art of adopting a rescued creature is to bring them to be the best they can be with love and patience.\n\nTheir adoption fee includes being spayed/neutered, they have received their 3 core puppy vaccines, dewormed, and a free health check up through a local participating vet clinic.\n\nReady to give them a forever home? Please follow the instructions and start with completing an application at the following link: http://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html\n\nWe are scheduling meet & greet adoption appointments and keeping a distance protocol.

She gets her little front paws moving up and down real fast and her stub-tailed booty shaking when she gets excited, but she doesn't jump on people. She has a very loving personality, loves to go for walks and enjoys playing with other dogs. Whiskey is about 2 years old and weighs 38 pounds. She came to us after having 6 puppies and tested positive for heart worms. She will be done with treatment on January 22 but will need to be on heart worm preventative the rest of her life. She has been outside most of her life, but is house trained. She would make a great family pet. If you would like more information about her, please contact our shelter at 870-269-5200 or visit her at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas. You can also go on-line at schspets.org and complete an adoption application.",

We do not show dogs to interested parties until they have an approved adoption application. If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on our website www.helpingshepherdsofeverycolor.com You may also find us on facebook: Helping Shepherds of Every Color Rescue.\n\nSingle young German Shepherd seeking loving family to move in with. Not looking for a room to rent, I want to share your home. I will be very faithful and loving. I love to chase the spray from the water hose. The final bonus is that I won't clear your coffee table with my tail because I had to have it amputated after I was hurt. I have a big bark, I'm sure it will scare bad guys away. I am still a little wild and crazy, my rescue peeps said they will work on my manners while I am waiting for my new family. P. S. Please tell that nice photographer lady that I wasn't trying to be mean. I just wasn't sure what that thing was that she pointed at me I met a cat, I'm not quite sure what to think about it, maybe cats are OK.\n\nI'm also not skeered to go outside in the rain.\n\nI have a special talent, I am a wound detector. One of my foster sisters had a boo boo and I kept licking her wound until her hooman investigated and found the sore. Does that make me Dr. Dog?\n\nAnyway, I still need some work on manners but if you take me home we can work on that together.",

Rory and Lorelai were both surrendered to a Texas shelter and are completed devoted to each other. Where one goes, the other follows. Rory is the more timid of the pair until she gets to know you.\n\nRory and Lorelai have done well around other dogs and older kids. At just 1 year old, Rory has great energy and loves nothing more than to run and play till her heart's content. She and Lorelai love to be out in the yard running, playing, and having the best time! We are not sure that they are the best group for little, little people since they don't yet understand how easily their energy can overwhelm a small child. They may also knock over a little one with the crazy playing. However, an older child they can run and play with? Bring it on!\n\nDuring the day while foster mom is away, they both hang out in their crates and recharge. As long as they are together, they are happy no matter what they are doing. They are both crate trained, and foster mom is working on some obedience training with them. As always, we recommend obedience training for all our rescues to bring out the best in them. With the Belgian shepherd mixes, there is always a good mix of stubborn thrown in with a hefty does of intelligence, so while training is more challenging, watching these girls bloom will be the best reward!\n\nIn the evening, after more afternoon play, Rory loves to lay in her dog bed and watch the household. If you get out of her line of sign, she loves to follow you around to see what interesting things you may be doing. While foster mom and Lorelai are snuggling on the couch, Rory has always thought her bed had the better view of the TV. As time goes on however, and she opens up more, Rory has started to venture on the couch as well. Each day she becomes more loving and open.\n\nNuts and Bolts: 1 year old, 50lbs, spayed, good with dogs and older kids, no cats or birds due to high prey drive, crate trained, potty trained, some obedience training, needs a yard to run.\n\nRory and Lorelai are being fostered in Christiansburg, VA and would love to meet you!\n\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

She is sweet and gentle and likes to cuddle. She has found snow to be a lot of fun. She is low key in the house, playing gently or just chilling with her people. She seems very smart and eager to learn new things.\n\nShe was recently returned to us as she turned out not to do well in a home with children. The noise and bustle made her a bit on edge! So a quiet home with predictable and little foot traffic is what we are looking for. She does not like meeting new people, and can often get defensive of her space in those situations. She is ok after gentle meetings, and when she is not pushed and given her own space. She does have some separation anxiety, but is working to improve that! \n\nThis sweet girl was left at a Georgia shelter with her nine puppies but the then of them made their way to Homeward Trails via a private plane! She has been an attentive mom to her nine pups and now it's her turn for some attention. She is underweight at 40 lbs and we believe she should be closer to 55 lbs or so. She is good with people and other dogs, but is not a fan of cats!\n\n Walks well on leash for most days, or will run alongside of you if you like to run! She would make a great jogging buddy. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Mary Beth \nLocation: Foster\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee DOES INCLUDE spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide a 30-minute phone consult with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert advice and guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program/",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Sedona began her life in a small town in northern AZ and was surrendered to a shelter there at 6 months old when her owners realized she was too much dog for their household. Luckily for Sedona, the shelter worked hard to network her and she was welcomed in the Paw Placement family in Phoenix, where her chances of finding the perfect forever home quadrupled!\n\nSedona is a sweet and energetic young girl. She is a working breed and therefore is highly intelligent and high energy. She is playful with her doggy foster siblings of all sizes, and would very much prefer to go home with a doggy playmate or two. Sedona has adjusted to city life well, however, she will not do well in a low activity household - she needs to run and play, hike and walk, and use her noggin to learn new skills and tricks. Sedona is crate and house trained in her foster home. She is not appropriate for an apartment type setting, she requires a house with a yard.\n\nSedona has become best friends with her foster brother, Beckham, who is also adoptable. These two really balance each other's energies; they spend equal time running, romping, playing and snoozing or chewing antlers. If you're looking for two intelligent, energetic dogs, they might just be the pair for you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application. Because we expect a large number of applications, and are still understaffed due to COVID19, we will only be able to email those applicants that are approved to schedule a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for your understanding if you don't hear back from us regarding your application.",

            "description": "Hello There!!! My name is Sheila-Belle and I am a two year old silver female Siberian Husky. \u00a0I started out with a family that kept me confined inside a fenced yard with little to no attention or activity. \u00a0I eventually escaped and ended up in the dog pound where Best Friends of Baker found me and placed me in a foster home. \u00a0I am currently living in a home with two teenagers who walk me daily, and play with me in a large dog arena. \u00a0There is a very large and older female German Shepherd who is the matriarch of the dog arena. \u00a0She has taught me how to run, play, wrestle with her and other dogs without being aggressive or timid. \u00a0I have also met barn cats, large and small dogs at the boarding facility and we all get along. \u00a0There are horses and three goats, chickens and other farm animals that I could care less about. \u00a0I am a very friendly and loving dog who is looking for an physically active family with or without children. \u00a0Siberians need and enjoy a full physical workout daily to keep them happy and satisfied. I am a small built female, but fast and strong enough to pull a sled on snow or wheels, go for long runs or hikes or even a slow and leisurely walk around the neighborhood daily. \u00a0I am current on all my vaccinations, wormed, and micro-chipped. \u00a0I will be spayed prior to my adoption. \u00a0I do require a secure fenced yard where I can be safe and secure, yet have access to my family inside the house. \u00a0I do not want to spend my life isolated outside, I want to be with a loving family that will allow me to sleep on a bed inside where it is warm and I can see and feel the love from them.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please submit an application https://www.bestfriendsofbaker.org/adoption-application and a volunteer will be in touch. Please understand we are an all-volunteer organization and we make every effort to return inquiries as soon as possible.\n\nFAQ:\n\"is Fido available for adoption?\"\nPlease assume that if a dog is listed as 'adoptable' on our Petfinder page we are still accepting applications for that pet. We do our best to keep the page up to date. \n\n\"is Fido good with dogs/older cats/male cats/children/orangutans/vacuums?\"\nEach animal is different, and our profiles try to address these questions. If you do not find your answer in the pet's profile, please submit an application or inquiry and a volunteer will be happy to speak with you about a particular animal.\n\n\"what is the adoption process?\"\nYou submit an application at: https://www.bestfriendsofbaker.org/adoption-application \nand then the applications for that animal are reviewed and references are checked. The home that is the best fit is contacted first if there are multiple applicants.  If there are homes of equal fit for the pet, the first submitted will be chosen. The chosen adopter will be contacted (usually by phone) and a meet-and-greet and or home visit is arranged to determine if the adoption will be finalized. If the person passes on the pet, we will contact the next applicant in line. \n\n\"how much does it cost?\"\nDog adoption fees generally range from $100.00-400.00 depending on how much veterinary care the dog has received. All adoption donations are tax-deductible and donations above the requested fee are appreciated. Every cent from our adoption fees goes toward helping the next animal in need. \n\n\"what veterinary care has Fido received?\"\nDogs are generally vetted upon intake and receive wormer and vaccines (rabies and a distemper/parvo combination vaccine). If intact and of the appropriate age, they are also spayed or neutered.  \n\nThank you for your interest in adopting. \n\nBest Friends of Baker, Inc.\nP.O.

He is extremely playful and looking for a home with someone that will make him part of the family. He has been trained to walk on a leash, too! Bubba is about 2 years old and a mix of lab, bully, and something with pointy ears. He weighs 75 lbs. He is now neutered, heartworm free, on heartworm prevention, up to date on his rabies shot, and dewormed. If you have any questions or would like to meet Bubba, please call Elaine at 864-378-6251.\n\nThis pup is posted as courtesy and is not affiliated with the Humane Society of McCormick County (HSMC).

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

He is only 8 months, which means Dee is any open book, and the two of you can write his story together.  Dee came to us from one of our rescue partners in NE Georgia.  He is all puppy energy, and we\u2019re negotiating not jumping up on us to say \u201chello, hello, hello, hello\u201d while we walk together.  That\u2019s a work in progress, but he has definitely settled down a little more, even with just a couple of weeks of practice.  With a little gentle guidance and some daily practice, you\u2019re going to help Dee grow into the prince he is.  He would love to find a home where he can get daily walks and lots of play time.  He would love to learn how to plan fetch and learn some skills he could show off.  Dee seems friendly and curious about other dogs.  If you\u2019re looking for a joyful, adventurous companion, he would be a great choice.  Because he\u2019s still working on his manners, we recommend him for older children, maybe about 6 and older.",

            "description": "Bandit is a sweet old man who just wants to lay around and be loved. At 8 years old, all that running around is for the pups. He's more than happy to stay close to you and watch the kids have fun. Bandit weighs 45 pounds.\nWhile his total history is a mystery, you can tell he's been in a few bad spots. The scars on his face are proof that he's had some run ins with some aggressive characters. But don't let his age fool you, he's no slouch. Him and one of my other dogs had a scuffle and Bandit will give it just as much as he can take it. He won't start anything, but he can hold his own if he needs to.\nHe gets along just fine with other dogs as long they don't mess with him first. I haven't had him around kids or cats, but I don't see any reason why they would bother him any. Very young children will probably need supervision as he gets anxious if his ears or tail is pulled. As long as you are respectful to him, he is respectful to you.\nHe's crate trained and housebroken. He can knows how to sit very well, and will basically stay put until you give him a reason to move. If you want a low energy dog to curl up on the couch with, he's your man!",

Peaches is good with male dogs, but isn\u2019t good with female dogs. \n\nShe is 100% house trained and hasn\u2019t had any accidents indoors. Peaches loves, and I mean loves to sleep as much as she can. She also enjoys her leisurely strolls and does well on the leash. In the time we\u2019ve had her she\u2019s met at least 10 adult people including a toddler and is friendly to everyone she meets. She doesn\u2019t jump on people but will definitely smell them if they want to pet her. \n\nThis dog is a 10/10 sweetheart and would be a loving, loyal dog to anyone. Peaches is also crate trained but I leave her out of the crate all day since usually one of us is home. If we are gone for less than 4 hours we leave her out of the crate during that time, too. For bedtime, I also leave her out of her crate. She will sleep all night and stay in bed late until you are ready to take her out to potty. She\u2019s an older lazy dog that loves a good place to sleep and relax. Peaches is not very vocal, I\u2019ve only heard her bark twice and that was because our cat scared her by jumping on the couch when she was sleeping. \n\nShe knows how to sit and to wait. She also enjoys car rides and ice cream from DQ. Sometimes she plays with toys but she really prefers sleepy time. \n\nPeaches is 6 year old, affectionate gentle giant at 75-80 pounds* that is easy to fall in love with. \n\n\n*She is on a diet and ideally would be 70 pounds.",

            "description": "How I Arrived At NHS: I came from a shelter in Oklahoma. This animal came from a shelter located in Tulsa, Ok. Animal shelters in the south are overrun with animals. Northwoods takes dogs from a shelter where these dogs would otherwise be euthanized. They now will have a second chance here in Minnesota.\n\nNotes from my foster parents:  Chico (who has no idea that's his name so it could really be changed to anything) has been wonderful! He's been in our home since 1/9 and has been incredibly well behaved.\nHe is an outdoor enthusiast! He has been loving the fresh snow and romps in the woods on a long lead. He benefits greatly from getting outside and burning off energy. He would stay outside as long as we let him, but does settle down nicely when back inside.\nHe truly loves people. Whether it's in his nature, having been in a shelter for awhile, or a combination of both, he does want to be with us constantly. So we've been working on teaching him it's ok to not be with us constantly but it's obviously been baby steps and short intervals of time.\nHe really doesn't like being closed into the kennel. At night we've been letting him sleep on a dog bed in our room and he's much more calm than when we tried the kennel for 2 nights. He lays down when we say goodnight and doesn't even move until we get up in the morning. I work from home and leave open the door to the kennel by my desk and he freely goes in there and sleeps during the day.\nHe's left everything alone in our house: shoes, mittens, pillows, hasn't tried to get into garbage cans or a bag of dog treats on the end table. He really has great manners!\nWhen we eat dinner he doesn't beg or get too close. He lays down on a dog bed and doesn't even whine. He does really love his own mealtimes though and we've been using a slow down bowl that takes him 10 minutes to eat a meal. He would really do well continuing with a bowl like this or a food dispenser because he eats very fast.\nHe's a pretty tough chewer and does well with filled, frozen kongs. But he can't ignore a squeaky toy either! He loves destroying the squeaky.\nWe've figured out he knows a few basic commands: sit (but mostly with a hand signal and not so much the word), drop it, go lay down. We've been slowly working on clicker training and he stays very engaged and eager to learn.\nHe really is a great dog who will make a great family member. He's up for adventures and loves car rides, even falling asleep on straight stretches. And he's very loving and snuggly and would eagerly snuggle up on the couch with you. \n\nNotes from NHS volunteer: I walked and later played ball with Chico. He is a bundle of fun!  I think he has springs in his feet. He almost dances/bounces when you walk him. Then when you throw the ball he will chase it and sometimes bring it back, or not, but if I pick up the ball and raise my hand in the air, he automatically sits until I throw it. He also knows shake. I did notice that when we were walking in the woods, Chico was very alert to any little animal that he saw or heard in the woods. He would likely NOT be good with cats in the home.\n\nGood With Kids: Unknown\nGood With Cats: Unknown\nGood With Dogs:  Unknown\nWe do require a meet-and-greet with your dog(s) onsite prior to any dog adoptions here at Northwoods.\n\nAll the dogs at Northwoods Humane Society have had a basic exam by a tech. They have been microchipped, tested for Heartworm (if over 6 months of age), had at least their first distemper combo vaccination (2nd if here longer), dewormed with a general dewormer, and had a flea and tick treatment applied if applicable. All the dogs will be spayed or neutered before they are adopted to their new permanent homes. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.",

He is looking for a foster to show him how great a home is and he promises to show the thanks with kisses and hugs. He gets along with other dogs, best around bigger dogs.\n\nWe will provide all the supplies needed to foster. Please be a hero and foster! \n\nHe weighs about 65 lbs and is now close to his healthy weight. He loves to nap on the couch, chew on his rubber bone, and romp around with with his foster brother at the park. Loves all dogs but best with dogs 30 lbs and over. Potty trained and crate trained. Plenty of slobber and snuggles to go around! \n\nHef is a gentle giant. Foster described him as a Velcro boy, he loves to follow her around the house. He is the best napper in the world. Lots of slobber and love to share. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. For more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process. Thank you for your interest in adopting a Dallas DogRRR.",

            "description": "Meet  Gizmo Giblet! 6 years old and 14lbs.\nGizmo should not be adopted into a home with kids as he prefers to be an only child. \nGizmo is the dog for you if you\u2019re looking for a boy that wants to be beside you, no matter what! You understand that he communicates by growling along with nasty comments, and you don\u2019t mind that he will bark and scratch at doors to get your attention when you leave him. He will also help keep friends and family away by barking, growling and snapping at them when they get close to you. He is a happy and playful boy that loves squeak toys and will insist on sleeping beside you and may pee in your bed\n \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Gizmo Giblets? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Gizmo Giblets.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Gizmo Giblets the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

I am a very sweet boy with lots of energy but I am very dog friendly and can be super sweet and gentle. Sometimes I can be dominant when engaging with other dogs and I may do best in a home where I am the only canine in town! I do have a strong prey drive and wouldn't like to be in the same home as a feline companion or any other animals. I love showing off my vocal side and will always be up for a treat when you ask me to sit, stay, give paw or speak! I could benefit from some leash training and I am a great candidate for a training and obedience courses. I always enjoy a dip in the water to stay cool and I love going for a car ride or a nice long leashed walk. I am very people oriented, and wants to be included in any activity with you whether active or passive. I just love spending time with you whether thats being brushed, getting belly rubs, or just cuddling on the couch.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.wagoninn.rescuegroups.org\n\n*****Courtesy Post*****\nThis is Lulu. Lulu is a 45 lb, 4 year old boxer-hound-pit mix. She's an absolute sweetheart, but she wasn't socialized as a puppy: she was found in the woods at age 1 in terrible condition. We rescued her in 2017. She loves running and cuddling, and is in her own home generally a very sweet dog; but she's unable to be around most other dogs except those in our household and she exhibits signs of resource guarding aggression from her time in the woods.\n\nWe are looking to rehome her with someone who needs a sweet, loving, loyal, imperfect companion. She should live in a place where she can run and get lots of exercise, ideally without other animals (although she's great friends with both our dog and cat, she is usually wary of pets she doesn't know.) She needs a strong, patient owner, as she is small but mighty. We love her dearly and she would make a great pet in a no children, no pet (or certain pets) home. If you have any questions, please email newhomeforlulu@gmail.com\n\nAdditional important information: She should not be left alone outside in a fenced in yard unless it's very tall, she can hop our 6ft fence. She is currently on a medium dose of fluoxitine (at the recommendation of our vet) to help with her anxiety, and that would need to continue. She needs frequent walks and hikes. Any adopter would also have to continue to work patiently with her fear and resource guarding issues. We were doing our best managing her issues and planned to keep her because she is a tremendously loving and playful dog. However, she bit our toddler on the head when he reached for her chew toy in a resource guarding situation; it was not a serious bite, but the potential for more scenarios like this exist and we have a duty to protect our son while also ensuring Lulu isn't relegated to a life in a crate or tied outside anytime our son is around. She deserves more than to spend her life in a crate or to be euthanized by a shelter at such a young age though, and we really hope to find her a new home.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org. Click on the orange Online Adoption Application button to fill out an application. A Wag On Inn volunteer will be in touch soon!",

I haven\u2019t been around many humans or fur friends growing up, i was isolated in a cage in the dark for the first year and a half of my life before being rescued and learning that there are good humans in the world.. Since I didn\u2019t grow up with friends or siblings so i can be a bit of a spazz in my approach, but i am getting better at saying hi and walking away! ?. It takes me a bit to warm up to nee people, but once i get to know and trust you, i promise i will love you forever. I get the zoommies at record speeds and may not be the most coordinated, but some have told me it\u2019s quite charming?\n\nI would prefer to be an only dog in my future family, who will ideally have the time and patience to help me continue re-adjust to my new surroundings. I am hopeful one day in the future I can make fur friends, but it may be a slow road. \n*\nI\u2019d love nothing more than to spend the holidays with my new foster or furever family?\u2014\u2014 And as a plus,  my Trump hands and elf ears will grace all your 2020 holiday family photos! ?? Foster or Adopt me?",

We think she\u2019s a cattle dog/terrier mix. \n\nShe was saved from death row and is now living the life. She loves other dogs and humans, but doesn\u2019t feel too strongly about cats. Good with children but maybe better with older kids. Miriam needs a little time to warm up to new people sometimes, but once she does she LOVES you!\n\nShe\u2019s is house-broken and kennel trained- but she loves sleeping in the bath tub haha or next to you! She also loooves the doggie pool!\n\nShe\u2019s up to date on vaccinations, flea prevention and HW prevention. \n\nMiriam gets nervous when bad weather rolls around, but other than that she is very easygoing. She would make the perfect little dog for someone!\n\nShe loves to run and play, loves to be in your lap, hugs your legs, loves her Kong with PB, head rubs, and gives kisses when you hold or carry her. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "'Quiet as a mouse!' That's how Pippa's hosts described her when she stayed in a couple of temporary homes on her way from a GA shelter to her foster home in VA. Quiet as a mouse and not much bigger than one, 10-year-old Pippa had all but given up before New Rattitude pulled the tiny Rattie mix from the shelter. She had been picked up as a stray, malnourished, severely underweight, and barely able to walk without falling over. Over the past three months, Pippa has received plenty of TLC, including dental work and veterinary care, that has enabled her to reach a healthy weight of 9 1/2 lbs. Full of appreciation for the 'second life' she has been given, she wants to be a very special pup to a very special person, who can help her manage a few remaining physical issues. One of them is a condition much like acid reflux disease in people; it just has a much longer name--bilious vomiting syndrome. Fortunately it can be prevented by feeding her 3x/day at 8-hour intervals. Pippa may also have the beginning stages of intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), which will require a home environment where she doesn't have to manage stairs (especially uncarpeted ones) and slick floors. She would benefit from a single-story house with easy access to a fenced yard, gently paced leash walks, and a ramp for furniture so that she can avoid jumping. Fortunately she's not prohibited from playing with canine buddies because this girl LOVES other dogs, but to be safe, playtime should be gentle, supervised, and limited to similarly sized dogs. She doesn't regard cats with the same affection she has for dogs, but the dog-savvy kitty in her foster home is not the least bit fazed by her. Because of her tiny size and the need to avoid physical activity that might aggravate her IVDD, she should not live in a home with young children. One of the joys in having Miss Pippa around is observing how much pleasure she derives from simple things like rolling in the grass or curling up in a comfy dog bed. And while she's not too sure what plush toys are for, she's very happy to repurpose them as pillows. Pippa is completely house-trained and will signal (quietly, of course) when she needs to go out. In this time of staying home and enjoying small pleasures, one of the greatest small pleasures you can enjoy will come from adopting Pippa, who will love you unconditionally, follow you like a shadow, and be quiet as a mouse. See more photos of Pippa in her online album at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/pippa .\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

Sweetie has been through a lot in her 3 years, she was used as a breeding dog and dumped when she was no longer needed, the owner did not realize she was pregnant. While at the shelter, that litter was aborted and Sweetie was then put up for adoption, but no one was interested. Paws From Afar was notified about her impending death and we stepped up and pulled her. This was in February and she was stuck without a ride to get to us. \n\nThank goodness for Dr. Kristy in Missouri who stepped in and offered to treat her heartworm and foster her until we could get her to New England.\n\nSweetie has finally arrived to us and is currently with our foster and trainer, Ms. Emily, in Maine. She is a very happy go lucky dog that loves other dogs, snuggling, going for walks and hikes.\n\nShe would do well in a home with kids, other dogs, NO CATS or other small animals, people with sofas, going on hikes, walks on the beach, you know active, BUT she is also mellow, very sweet and seeks attention.",

Now she\u2019s the quickest in her foster home and always up for play time. She\u2019s a sweet snuggle bug who can\u2019t wait to find her own family. \n\n\nPLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PET\n\nINQUIRIES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE WITHOUT AN APPLICATION.\n\nONLY APPROVED APPLICANTS WILL BE CONTACTED.  \n\nAll animals will be vaccinated, microchipped, spayed/neutered prior to signing adoption contract. \n\nSo, you have found a pooch you want to meet? Great! We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

I'm a really happy, wiggly girl who needs work on my manners. When I meet people, I jump on them, and I do the same thing when I meet dogs. The FRGSR volunteers are working with me on this. Like many young dogs, I need to learn some basic obedience, and I'll need an adopter who will commit to continue with my training so that I will become a well mannered dog. I would be a great hiking or jogging partner, and I'm hoping an outdoorsy person/couple will adopt me! My adoption fee is #350 and if you are interested, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

He's got lesions on his spine which makes using his rear legs difficult, so this sweet young boy has a special request - a few months to figure out if those lesions will resolve on their own or require surgical repair. He's still a growing boy and it's best to wait until he's all grown up before performing surgery. In the meantime, it will be best to help him stay as calm as possible to help along any natural healing processes. Marco is described as friendly with all the people he meets, and he has an inquisitive nature, always wanting to check out anything new. He's smart, Smart, SMART, and will do great with learning all the tricks you want to teach! Dogs bring a lifetime of unconditional love, so what's a few months? Marco wants you to call his name. Send an email to adoption@wilco.org to schedule an appointment to meet him.",

            "description": "Elsa is a stunning, 4-year-old, black & tan, female, German Shepherd Dog.  She arrived in rescue when her owner lost her home.  Elsa was raised by a single adult so we are looking for an adult only home for her.\n\nElsa has been around other dogs, but she isn\u2019t inclined to play with other dogs.  We feel she would really love to be the only pet in her new household as she is very people-focused.\n\nElsa has been absolutely spoiled in her foster home.  She has been entertained with lots of playful brushing, dancing (yes, she can dance!), hide and seek, tennis ball play, her favorite snake and lots of massage. Yes, completely spoiled!\n\nElsa will flourish with time spent on basic commands and training.  She is well behaved, crate-trained and sleeps in her crate with the door open.  You will hear her happy in the house as she moans and sighs when she is relaxed.  It will take her a bit to adjust (as all shepherds do) and needs a special match!\n\nElsa is a very gentle dog to have around the house and she has impeccable house manners, too.  Although, she hides her edible dog bones all over the house - under the carpets and in the corners - super sweet & crumbly remembrances.\n\nElsa loves to be brushed daily and she likes different brushes.  She likes to watch and approve her food preparation, but has a sensitive stomach and needs a consistent diet.  Elsa would love someone who works from home,  or who is partially retired, or who has a flexible schedule; she has had no accidents and no anxiety issues.  She loves to go in the car and is a perfect angel; she will take over the driver's seat if you leave, though. ?\n\nElsa's new home will need to have a fenced or secured backyard, please.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Elsa, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only.

He ended up there because his owners had passed away. He was not only heartbroken, he was also homeless. The future didn't look so bright for ol' Max.\n\nIt turns out Max, being a bit older, has a few conditions which are totally manageable with TLC and meds: arthritis, an enlarged heart , bladder stones (so he needs a special diet), a harmless fatty tumor under his front leg that we already had removed, and the poor old man has an enlarged prostate! He will need to be neutered at 14 years old!! \n\nSomething about Max told us we shouldn't walk away and leave him there. His owners would have wanted him to live a good life after all. \n\nDespite his medical issues, Max is doing well for his age! He is a super sweet and a highly lovable dog. After a bit of grooming -- he now looks like a handsome brand spankin' new young dog! \n\n##### NOTES FROM HIS FOSTER: ##### Max loves to play fetch. Max is great on and off a leash. He enjoys walks around the neighborhood on a leash.Max is good with other dogs and cats so far. Max seems to be fabulous with all other people. Loves to be rubbed and scratched but he isn't a lap cuddler. Most of all, Max is just loveable and wants to be loved. He would be happy to go anywhere and everywhere with his forever person. Please come and visit me at the Adoption Center inside PetSmart in Midland, TX! \n\nCheck out all the currently adoptable pets on www.midlandhumane.org/adoptables",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Hagan, and my New Year's Resolution for 2021 is to find a place I truly belong. So to do that, I decided to write down a few things you should know about me!\nOne word people use to describe me is \"\"sweet,\"\" and not to brag or anything, but I don't think they're wrong. Being this sweet comes with some big responsibilities, though! For starters, I have to be as polite as possible, and I try my best to do just that. I try to walk nicely for the volunteers, and I always make sure to smile at people as they pass by.\nTo make sure I don't get too excited, I like to run my energy out in the play yards. My favorite toys are the ones that squeak. Oh, I just love it when they make that noise! I love to play fetch with the toys, and I find that after a good long time outside, the one thing that really hits the spot is a belly rub.\nSo, if you get the chance, come say hello to me! I'm a little shy at first, but who isn't when they meet strangers? Once I warm up to you ,I'm sure we will have nothing but good times!",

He knows many commands including sit, down, stay, place, heel, paw, and roll over. He is crate trained as well. \n\nHowever, like a lot of teenagers, he sometimes forgets his manners and jumps up to say hello instead. He gets crazy zoomies and loves his toys. Sometimes in his excitement he misses the toy and can catch hands instead. He doesn't mean harm just lots of excitement and energy. \n\nHe wasn't properly socialized as a young puppy so he can be rude and sometimes reactive with other dogs so he would love the chance to get to be your one and only. \n\nYou should also know he really loves armpit scratches, so please be willing to accommodate. Wilbur LOVES to work and play, he is not a chill on the couch kinda dude, but if lots of fetch and training games and a high energy ready to go friend is what your looking for he is your man. Because of his abundance of excitement we recommend he not go to a home with young children.",

Candy is more on the energetic side and would do excellent with someone who likes to take walks or has another friendly little pup. Candy can be a bit scared at first, so no young kids. She has a bit of a cute attitude, she lets you know how she is feeling! She really could do with a foster to decompress.",

            "description": "If you could describe May in four words, it would be cute, smart, proper, and loyal! This adorable lady gets along great with a 75lb pit bull in her foster home, and her beard is just precious. This crate-trained and house-trained gal has never had an accident in the house, and she really enjoys her daily walks. She is generally great on the leash, but can respond to some dogs but not others. She would definitely benefit from additional leash etiquette lessons. She also goes right in at the 'kennel' command for a treat and is calm and quiet while inside, so you can rest easy while you are away on your errands. She will 'sit, for treats, but won't always hold the sitting pose. May would ideally love a low-traffic home with a human who is experienced with special dogs. We don't know everything about May's history, but she has a tendency to be mouthy, and would love a human who can continue training her on redirection. May can be a little wary and will come by her humans and seemingly ask for pets, but it's important to only engage in pets with her consent, especially when meeting new people. An ideal home for May would be an adult only, low-traffic house with not many visitors, and with someone who is experienced at handling mouthy pups. She could also do well with another doggie friend that matches her energy. Come meet May, her beard will bring a smile to your face!",

            "description": "Location: Gloucester, VAHi, the name is Zeus! And I am in the market for a new home for the holidays and for all the days of my life. Could that be you? Let me tell you about myself. Not only am I happy and affectionate, I used to live on a farm. My former family had to give me up through no fault of my own, but they speak highly of me. I lived with another dog and we got along fine. She was a submissive female. I like to swim in the creek, ride in the car and am happy to go in a crate. I also got along with the peacock. How many dogs do you know that have a peacock for a friend? But I didn't get along with the pigs, or the cats. The stress of the pound makes me grumpy with other bully dogs and we get rowdy through the fence or gate, so if you have or plan to have me around other dogs, you will need to do a meet and greet with them. Of course, I would love to be an only furry child. I need to catch up on my couch cuddles. In my former home, I loved visiting with children and I love to walk on the leash. A fenced in yard would be great too as I have lots of playful energy. I take treats gently and appear to be at least partially housebroken, as I do my biz the minute we go outside.\n\nSadly, I am heartworm postive and will need to be treated for them. The local humane society will pay for and do the treatments. After that, you can do what is called a foster to adopt, where I come to live with you while I finish up my treatment. At the end of treatment, you can officially adopt me. Oh how I long for the day to be adopted and have my own home again!\n\nIf you want to know more about my personality, please contact Joyce at 757-376-8360 or email at jemerson60@hotmail.com\n\nI am at the Gloucester Animal Control pound at this time and have been here since I arrived. However, all adoptions are administered by the Gloucester Mathews Humane Society . To apply for my adoption, please contact them at animalplacement@gmhumanesociety.org. If you have a vet, you might want to let them know that they will be contacted so you can give permission for them to give information.\n\nPlease come meet me, I will give you lots of loving and will be your new best friend.",

She has puppy energy and is in need of learning social skills and reading other dogs cues. She would succeed best in a home with a playful dog her size. She has been in a home with 3 cats, and was scared of them.\n\nWe do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available. Dogs going to adoption event are typically posted on our Facebook page the day prior.\n\nDetails about our adoption procedures can be seen at www.pupandcatco.com.",

While we don\u2019t know Hotch\u2019s breed, we can guarantee he is 70 pounds of good boy! A little cold weather doesn\u2019t stop him from heading out to do his business.Have to step out? Ask this guy to take a rest in his kennel, and he will gladly oblige. In fact, he enjoys a little peace and quiet there. He can be a bit shy at first, but patience will get you tail wags and quality time with a top notch pal. He would love a walking partner and a harness that will help keep him from pulling. If you adore his old school gentlemanly ways, apply now!\n\nwww.lucky7dogrescue.com/applynow\n\n",

Baba Yega walks nicely on the leash unless he sees another dog. He is dog reactive and has a high prey drive, so he will do best as the only pet in the household. He will also need training to work on his leash reactivity, but he loves food, which should make for easy motivation in training. Per his previous owner he likes green beans, carrots and lettuce. Because he's lived in a home before he will probably pick up the new rules quickly.\n\nHis previous owner stated he is very affectionate and loves to hang out with people.

He's a lap dog at time, however he prefers just slumbering in a comfy doggy bed or in his opened crate (leave the crate door unlocked) He likes humans, but not a fan of humans below the age of 13. He prefers Senior Humans just like him. Sausage can get along with any size dogs as long as he doesn't have to share food. Then he becomes a scrapper, however he complies to commands and rules.\n\nHe's not completely house trained, having come from a hoarding situation, but will use a potty pad if you arent able to let him out often. He's a very well mannered little old chap. Sausage needs a family that can give him a warm cozy fireplace to lay by and a window to watch the squirrels and birds outside. UTD on shots and Heartworm negative. Please give this Senior Chi a forever home.",

            "description": "1/21/21 Update on Danny Boy's adoption status: Danny  is still available and we are still looking for a home with the perfect yard for him.  It is out there, somewhere. He did have a home lined up, but the people decided that they did not want to take the responsibility of keeping him safe. We understand, it's a serious responsibility indeed.\n\nHe has had two surgeries in less than 6 months to remove stones/rocks from his belly and intestines. We are looking for a back yard that has NO rocks or stones. None, period. You must have  pavers/concrete/artificial turf only.  Natural grass ALWAYS has rocks and stones working their way to the surface.  No, it is not nutritional. He's been tested.  No, we will not rely on training. Most trainers agree that a clean environment is the safest thing for him.  No, a few rocks won't work. Rocks are rocks. No, it's not boredom.  \n \nDanny's foster mom said \"We  have natural grass and he always wears a muzzle or Outfox head mesh when he goes outside. My fervent wish is to find a back yard where he will be able to go out without those devices, and people who are willing to use them whenever he is outside elsewhere.\"\n \nIf you can meet these requirements and are looking for a sweet, dog and cat-friendly, 4-year-old purebred English Cream Golden and would like to talk, you can email info@arizonagoldenrescue.org.\n\nDanny Boy is a handsome, neutered 4-year-old English Creme Golden.  He was returned to the breeder when the owner passed away a few month ago. We did not receive much information from the breeder at intake, so we only know what we have learned the past month in foster care..\n      \nDanny loves his food and was up to 112 pounds at one point, but is a svelte 87 now. It's a good weight for him - he is a big boy. He had surgery 4 months ago for eating rocks and he continues to seek out and swallow them when he can. Danny is loving, people and dog-friendly and is not destructive when left alone, but will counter-surf if given the opportunity. In addition to rocks, he enjoys empty dog food cans, plastic containers and carrots for treats. He loves to play but can also sit and chill out. He loves the couch and cuddling on the bed, but could learn to stay off if needed. He loves to ride in the car and going on walks. Danny Boy is very strong, but walks very well on a leash when using a Gentle Leader or similar head halter. \n\nDanny was very matted when he came in but has since had a grooming and trim. When his coat comes in it will be medium length and not difficult to maintain.\n\nThere are many options with rock-eating dogs to try to train and modify their bad habits, but we feel the safest environment for him is a rock/gravel-free yard. It is also recommended by veterinarians and trainers to use a basket muzzle on him when he is loose in an area that has rocks - such as parks, woods, etc. However, he does not need that on a leashed walk.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Danny Boy, you must fill out an application and have a home visit to begin the approval process..   WE DO NOT ADOPT OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA.   If you are interested in Danny, please visit our webpage at arizonagoldenrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption  and complete an Online Adoption Application to begin the process, or send an e-mail to info@arizonagoldenrescue.org if you have questions and wish to be contacted.\n\nPrior to adoption, all AGR dogs are given a full vet exam, including valley fever and heartworm tests, brought up to date on all vaccinations, given a microchip, neutered or spayed, and treated for any medical problems.",

This boy is not a couch potato but get him out for a good round of fetch or take him for a jog and he will be ready to kick back on the couch with you.  He still is a pup at just one year old.   He does know some basic command like sit and shake and is a quick learner and eager to please.   He wouldn't be hard to teach new tricks to.   If you would like to consider adding Cooper to your family complete our online adoption application on our web page.\n\nUPDATE: you can now add lie down and stay to this little dude\u2019s repertoire. He is also picking up on the \"Place\" command. He\u2019s wicked smart and super sweet. What more could you want for a dog!",

At 2, this very good boy had to recently come back to us after nearly a year and a half in a loving, happy home.  His fosters-turned-adopters worked so hard to build up his confidence and shape him into the very good boy he is today.   He ADORED their other dog, who became his best friend and guide to living with humans.  But, lately, Thunder was showing signs he was frightened of their toddler.  They were broken-hearted to bring him back, but this was absolutely the safe and right decision.    Now that we have a clearer idea of Thunder\u2019s needs, we would love to see him in an adult home with a companion dog who can show him the ropes.  Thunder is sweet, curious, house-trained, great with other dogs and bashful with new humans.  He is so eager to be your friend. Thunder is much-loved at PAWS Atlanta and we\u2019re determined to help him to find a home in which he can thrive and be happy.  He is playful and resilient and is just a great young dog.",

My name is Jasper and I'm at AGPR because my canine brother and I did not get along.  So I resorted to digging my way out and running away.\n\nThe volunteers at AGPR are working with me on my manners.  I get so excited to be with people that I like to jump up and give lots and lots of hugs...they are trying to teach me \"four on the floor\" and to wait to be invited up for hugs.  It is tough...I so want to hug everyone I meet.  But, I'm also food motivated, so I need to make decisions between hugs or treats.  Now do you see my dilemma?\n\nMy future home has to be CAT FREE and SMALL ANIMAL FREE.  I just don't like or trust those small critters...they are tricky!  I'm not a city boy...I'm still growing, have lots of energy and need a family willing to work on my manners.  In return, they will have my unconditional love (unless someone else offers me a tasty treat).\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

            "description": "Have you eve seen such a handsome young boy?  My name is Polar - I think my owner named me because I looked like a little polar bear when I was a pup.  Until recently, I lived in an apartment.  I came to AGPR because the new owners of the apartment complex said I was too big to stay there.  So now I am looking for a family with a big yard and time to play with me.\n\nI turned a year old a little while ago so I still have quite a bit of puppy behavior in me.  The nice volunteers at AGPR are working on my leash skills and teaching me some manners.  Honestly?  I'd rather play and have fun...I'm too young to be serious.\n\nI have recently had playdates with one of the females at the rescue but I have a bit more energy than she does.  I want to play and play hard and she was more interested in being with the volunteers.  Hey - I just want to have fun!\n\nNo more apartments for me...with my childish energy, I need a big yard to run and play and get lots of exercise.  My future family needs to know that I am not done growing yet - I'm going to be a big boy and they will need to help me with my manners.\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Taco and I was born April 27th and growing every day. I will be a medium sized dog when I'm fully grown and will likely top out somewhere around 35-40lbs. My foster mom and I have been guessing my breed and think some type of frenchie, corgi, terrier mix, but she says it doesn't matter because I'm just a big snuggle bug of love. Whoever adopts me will have a loyal sidekick for life. When you call me to you, I will run to you like a speeding bullet and JUMP in your lap for the biggest hug ever. I am great with kids, other dogs and cats who like dogs. I have a few quirks for my young age so I am very clear on the type of home that I'm looking for. Here are my pre-requisites, and these are non-negotiable for me! \n\n-I need an experienced dog owner. I have been working on my fear of men, crates, and resource guarding in my foster home and need someone who will continue that work diligently with me!\n-I need another dog in the home with me who is either a patient medium/large breed dog, or a small breed pup who can hold their own with a larger fur sibling, who will help continue to teach me good manners around dogs. I also LOVE to play and spend time with my foster fur siblings, so I'd really like to have another dog in the home to keep me stimulated and happy! \n-And last, but not least, I need my experienced owner to take me to beginners obedience classes. This will help me with continued socialization around other dogs and men, and also teach me the right boundaries around how to behave in my new home.\n\nI KNOW I will flourish in a house like this and I hope that the perfect home is out there looking for a perfect dog like me. I will bring you all the joy in the world and will be your fiercely loyal companion for years to come! \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.

I also love sitting on the couch watching TV when I am not playing inside.\n\nI am an owner surrender due to my timidness and fear. My previous owner originally rescued me in Charlotte, NC over two years ago. Because of my past, I am nervous around strangers and bark/back up but am NOT aggressive at all!\n\nOnce I see I can trust you, I will be your best friend! I may still bark if you surprise me but quickly calm down. I will need an experienced dog owner who will have the patience to let me get to know and trust them. If you have a friendly dog I can be buddies with it would help me even more with my confidence as my foster brothers and sisters have done for me in my current foster home. The best thing for me would be if my bestie Ramen could be adopted with me too! She makes me so so happy and makes me feel secure ans safe.\n\nI am totally house trained as well as crate trained and exceptionally good on a leash for long walks or jogs. I love car rides but I have not been with small kids and have not been tested with cats. I eat alone or in my crate and would have to take it slow if I eat with a future brother or sister.\n\nI am looking for my furever home where I can give you all the love I have in my heart!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

            "description": "Maya is a beautiful Shepherd/Belgian Malinois mix who was found in the streets of Salinas. Saved off the streets where she was observed to have no understanding of the consequences of running in traffic, Maya completed her hold at the shelter after the good Samaritans were unsuccessful in finding her owners. \n\nMaya appears to have lived her previous life in a homeless situation and took a few days to adjust to being inside in her first shared foster homes while we waited for her spay and recovery. Maya was fortunate to have two family friends care for her. In one household, she lived with two resident shepherds and in the other with an American Pit Bull and another pit mix smoothly transitioning between households to accommodate schedules. Maya is currently sharing her foster home with a dog-savvy cat and three shepherds. Maya is a dominant female willing to test boundaries to establish her preferred spot in the dog pack. Since she is very people affiliative, she would be delighted to live as an only or with an easygoing, confident male dog.\n\nComfortable in the car for adventures, Maya is also potty and crate trained. She had reliable recall off-leash with her prior fosters; she hasn't been off-leash outside of her current foster home. Maya has excellent household manners, sleeps in her crate quietly at night. She likes to stick by her people with excellent eye contact for guidance. Bonded with the male resident shepherd her age, they spend hours playing with similar play styles. \n\nMaya's super playful and in each of her foster homes gravitates to a favorite playmate. She is agile, swift, and a joy to watch. Although Maya lacks the off top energy and busyness of a Belgian Malinois, she still needs a daily exercise routine appropriate for her age and energy level. She has been getting worn out by her buddy's play needs, slowing down for long nap near her people. Maya will make an excellent running, hiking partner. She is working on heeling, loves to be leashed up for walks. Although she will chase balls and run with them, she hasn't figured out the bringing back part. Maya also loves soft toys, digging in to find the squeakers and then using remnants of the toys for tug of war with her best friend. \n\nWhen Maya discovers a favorite new toy, she hides them around the house and yard, carefully picking her hiding spot to retrieve later. Sometimes they are out in the open, in a corner, or tucked under furniture. She is learning to navigate things that spook her, such as the sound of the garage door opening and closing, when something falls on the ground like the mop handle. It appears as she may have been mistreated at some point as she will pancake if a stick is thrown for fetch. \n\nSo far, she is indifferent to the resident cat who has established order with her. Her original finder also told us she was good with her kids. Maya has not spent time with the kids in her foster homes. \n\nWith a little time, patience, and love, Maya grants her trust. She will nudge hands to continue getting petted, put her head on laps, and sit smooshed next to her people for naps and belly rubs. With that trust, her forever family will be rewarded with a beautiful young, active, and affectionate partner. \n\nMaya is terrified of veterinary care constraints and needs to be desensitized to conquer her fears. She may need to be medicated to initially reduce her anxiety for vet visits. \n\nMaya is currently fostered in Sacramento and is available to meet approved adopters committed to enhancing their bond with Maya with patience, structure, and training.",

She was found as a stray in SC so we dont have a ton of info on her, her papers from SC say she is estimated to be 6 but we think she is a few years younger by her looks and energy. She loves to chew on nylabones, and toss her toys around in her crate at the shelter. She would enjoy a family that can take her for long walks and cuddle with her on the couch!  She interacts with dogs ok on leash and in play groups but didn't seem to love living with a dog in foster care (she played rough and was bossy). When Sissy Mae gets excited she gets wobbly and walks/runs with a very unique gate, she has already been examined and cleared by a vet! But she does have difficulty with too many steps. Please apply to meet this sweet girl! \n\n\nApply at: http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fee is $150\nShe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\nApplications are required before meeting a dog.

I've got the \"II\" after my name because there is another Daisy at Appalachian Great Pyrenees Rescue and I don't want to be confused with her.\n\nI was so very lucky to have a professional photo shoot and she captured all my beauty!  So please don't hate me because I'm so beautiful.  I'm a big girl and have a bit of resource guarding when it comes to my food.  I do enjoy playing with other dogs but need to meet them first to make sure they like me. My future family would greatly benefit from having Great Pyrenees experience and the ability to work with me on my resource guarding.  For that reason, a family with children may not be the best fit.  \n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nMURPHY is a white and brown American bulldog. He ended up at the shelter with a notation on his cage card that he reportedly had been aggressive with other dogs and children. Apparently, he had been nipping at the feet of children and other dogs. In  some dogs this can be considered breed specific behavior, especially if they are herding dogs. While staff consider him a very sweet dog at the shelter, they believe it is important for potential adopters to understand the reason they do not want him to go to a home with other dogs and children. You can check with them by telephone to ask questions about this dog or any other dog that you may be interested in adopting. They may or may not know the circumstances beyond the information that was provided and posted to the cage card. If you do have dogs already or young children in your home, please do not call them and ask about adopting this dog. They do their very best to make sure that dogs are placed in suitable homes with responsible people to protect the community and the animals, as well. They need your help to make that happen. If you do not have other dogs or young children in your home, staff would welcome your call to schedule an adoption appointment to meet him in person. MURPHY has not yet been neutered. So, please read the important information below. \n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

I have been at the Agoura Animal Care Center since November 23, 2020. \n\nThis handsome guy is 5 years old. He enjoys being pet, loves a real room lounge, a stroll around the kennels on leash, and spending time with the ladies!\n\nHe was terrified when he arrived at the Care Center. He\u2019s not had an easy go of it prior to arrival with us - evidence of a long since healed possible burn to his back which caused fur loss and abandonment by his prior person left Kane heartbroken & scared. \n\nWhile he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be friends with us at first, we quickly found he\u2019s a \u201cladies man\u201d and gave him time ( and plenty of treats!) with the women on our special teams. He quickly learned he was safe, and though sometimes a bit insecure, he now seeks attention, enjoys pets, and is good on a leash. \n\nHe\u2019s missing fur on his back by his tush, we aren\u2019t sure why but appears to have been some kind of a burn long since healed. \n\u2022\nKane is looking for an adult only true forever home.?(he\u2019s been abandoned twice) A calm dog companion would be ok but no small dogs please. \n\nTo inquire about Kane please email agoura@animalcare.lacounty.gov (Please include your contact number).",

            "description": "Max is a 7yr old chihuahua, weighs 7 lbs now and is up to date on his shots and recently was neutered. He was rescued in September  from being in a fenced small area outside year round with 5 other dogs. He is ok with other dogs but he gets jealous for attention when another is getting attention.  He has learned to walk on a leash but needs some coaxing at times. He was not an inside dog so he tries to mark things in the home and has accidents.  He uses the cue of let go potty\" to get on his leash and go outside to potty. He loves to have belly rubs and wants to cuddle up to whomever he decides is his person.  So far he is only attached to one person so some time to adjust is still needed. He is still young at heart and full of energy so a fenced in yard would be ideal so he can run some. \n\nIf interested, text Gayla at 919-820-3217. Adoption fee: $300 & NC adoptions preferred.",

            "description": "Our precious GRACIE was discovered as a stray in Tipton County, TN, while running with a Great Pyrenees she met along the way. The owner of the Pyrenees discovered them and easily rescued his dog, but frightened Gracie ran into the woods and was not coming out to say hello. Before these kind people could get back with a trap to trap her, they found this precious dog had just been attacked by a large dog. At that point, Gracie gratefully accepted rescue and was taken to the Tipton County Animal Shelter where she was taken to a local veterinarian to be examined and treated for her wounds. Strangely, only one wound could be found. Thank goodness an angel was watching over her! Lee Riley, shelter director, walked Gracie by several large dogs at the shelter to check her reaction. Forgiving Gracie was non-reactive and showed no fear. \n\nWe contacted Lee, with whom we have often worked, to express our interest in helping this sweet, sweet girl just as soon as her stray hold is up. Who could resist those big Beagle ears! So, we took Gracie, along with Lily from the same shelter and featured also on this site, and both went immediately to our vet in Olive Branch where Gracie was treated for elevated liver levels, as well as her wound. Our vet, also, could find only one wound from Gracie\u2019s attack, which easily healed. Her liver levels are perfectly normal now, giving us the green light to go on and spay her last week and do her dentals. We are seeing such good progress, as her video shows, that our vet permitted her to go to a temporary foster in Memphis for the two week holidays. Her foster dad is the same kind young man who fostered our Archie Beagle through heartworm treatment. \n\nEstimated to be about 3 years old, Gracie\u2019s present weight is about 23 pounds. The only applications we are accepting for Gracie at the present time are from families who are interested in fostering-to-adopt. Our Hayley is presently in such a home and doing great with her heartworm treatment. Her foster family tells us what a great bonding experience it is to be such an integral part of her journey to wellness. They LOVE her! We want the same for Gracie\u2014to be able to go into a loving home with a loving family who would like to be a part of Gracie\u2019s journey to wellness and her forever home.  If you think you are the right family for Gracie and are willing to foster-to-adopt her, please contact Diana at dmoore2003@bellsouth.net.  We are very interested in talking to you and meeting you.\n\nWe should tell you that our Beagles are VERY popular. If you think you may be interested in this beautiful Beagle girl, please write us for an adoption application to get your name on her potential adopters\u2019 list, many of whom are willing to wait for our dog till all vetting is completed. Please ask to apply only if you are a serious adopter and plan on completing our adoption application. We are inundated during the pandemic with adoption application requests.",

DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF APPS/INQUIRED WE RECEIVE, WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO APPS/INQUIRES THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THIS DOG. Thank you! \n\nMeet Flash!\n\nFlash is an approximately 3 year old male Australian Cattle Dog aka Blue Heeler.  He is a pretty small guy at only 32lbs.  Adopter will need to have breed or like breed experience (border collie, Australian Shepherd, etc).  Cattle dogs are highly intelligent as well as high energy and high drive.  He does know some commands like sit, paw, come, no, leave it, kennel up.    Overall he is a confident dominant male but is ok with other dogs. Flash is housebroken as well.  Because we don\u2019t know how he is with kids and the breed tends to be protective of their family kids 14 and older.  Cats are unknown but can be tested if needed.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.00. \nAdoption application & home visit required.  Flash requires a fenced in yard. Adopters must live within 30 miles of Cleveland. \n\nIf interested in Flash fill out an app on our website www.muttsinarutrescue.com",

Do you need daily laughs in your life at the antics of a dog? Then you will love Percy Cole Prince Jackson and see why his foster mom has nicknamed him \"Chocolate Kiss.\" Besides looking like a miniature chocolate lab, this dog is always super excited to see anyone and everyone, and he will greet you with all kinds of doggy kisses and wiggly butt - sometimes will even show off and run in circles and bounce when you enter a room. He is a super sweet 2-3 year old, 40-lb., possible lab/hound mix bundle of love. He has short chocolate brown shiny fur with some white patches on chest and paws, and golden eyes. He is great with all people and older kids, has not been tested with young children, but would likely be fine with some formal training to calm down and manner lessons. He lived the first years of his life outside but is a smart boy and learning his inside manners and is almost 100% housebroken. He is happy to curl up with his people after playtime and is a snuggler. When he came to our rescue from rural GA, he was a \"light positive\" for heart worms. He's been treated and will need follow up with our vet (at the rescue's expense) to make sure he's all clear. He's playful and energetic, and would do best with a dog(s) his size or bigger to rough and tumble with, or as an only dog. If he's an only dog, he needs an active family that will pay lots of attention to him with plenty of love, walks and play time. He has been tested with a cat and he just sniffed and wagged his tail. He is fully crate trained and will sleep quietly through the night and be ready to greet you in the morning with his chocolate kisses! We are requiring Percy's adopter to have a minimum 6-ft. secure fenced-in yard for him.\nIf you think you have the perfect forever home for Percy, we'd love to find out more about you. Please fill in our adoption application and we'll see if you're Percy's perfect match.",

            "description": "PLEASE read his entire bio and answer the questions at the end, we will not respond to you if you don't answer the questions. \nOur sweet Sarge is back, through no fault of anyone, his adopters were wonderful and took him to a behaviorist and after several sessions, it became clear he is a very reactive dog. Absolutely nothing mean or aggressive, he just has a hard time with a lot of activity going on around him. This is what's hard about stray dogs, we have no history and cannot predict every scenario. So his needs have changed, no young children (12yrs and younger), no cats and no dogs, he needs plenty of room to run, more than a large yard, he needs acreage. He needs some one who can give him a job, who would consider agility training for him, who has time for training. \n \nSarge is an 5yr old German Shepard. Sarge came in as a stray with terrible skin infection from fleas, he was infested!!! He has lost a good portion of his fur, but its growing back. His skin still has along way to go, with medicine, a proper diet, dewormer and of course flea treatment we've already seen a difference. We can see he is feeling better as he runs around our backyard playing, chasing the balls, rolling in the grass and well just being a happy dog. He knows some commands and is a very loving, sweet dog. \n\nMy adoption fee is $150\n\nPlease answer the following questions, so we know if you are a good fit for Roxy. All our dog meet and greets are by appointment only, we try to get back to everyone in 72hrs, multiple e-mails are not necessary and we cannot answer any questions over the phone. \n\n1. Do you own or rent? If you rent can you get a letter form landlord stating you can have a large dog? \n2. How many people live in the home? Age groups? \n3. Do you have a large fenced yard? Preferably acreage? \n4. Do you have cats or dogs? If so, please don't apply. Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: Black Weight: 82lbs Age: 5yrs 2mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Look no further for your perfect pet! Meet Buddy! A 2 yr old, 60 lb Yellow lab/Shepard mix. \nHe is an extremely sweet and intelligent family dog. He loves kids and other dogs of all sizes. He hasn\u2019t been tested around cats off the leash, but we really don\u2019t think he would hurt a fly. \nHe\u2019s obsessed with tennis balls and playing fetch. He lives to please his people. He was found as a stray and is heart worm positive and in treatment. He can definitely stand to put on more weight but he has plenty of energy. \nHe\u2019s housetrained and is learning to be crate trained when his fosters leave the house. He also knows some basic commands. \nAny adopter would be lucky to welcome this sweet boy into their home!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

In his evaluation, staff said he was nervous but tolerated other dogs greeting him and was friendly with the handlers. He gave good greetings and corrected appropriately when he needed space. He was a bit anxious but friendly and warms up quickly. Guero is not a fan of small dogs. Maybe he's worried about competition in the ears club? Whatever the reason, no small critters in his future home please! In one of Guero's previous homes he was kept outdoors and he let us know that he would really like to move on up into the nice warm (or air cooled) house he has been dreaming of. He did well with kids he knew but might need to take his time with meeting new ones. His family reported that he was housetrained. I met this sweet boy for the first time today. He was a bit shy but met me at the kennel door, leashed up well and was ready to go. He really enjoyed our walk, smelling all the smells. And his ears are fantastic! Can't wait to get to know him a little better. - PACC volunteer",

She was surrendered because her family had a new baby and they were not able to give her the attention she needs.  She will come up and lick your hand for attention and shake and walk with you outside.  She needs a home with some exercise and love. NOT GOOD IN A MUTI DOG HOME or WITH CATS.  Needs her own attention and is a loving companion. Follows you around and lays at your feet.  House, crate, leash trained.  She gets along great with people but just not other dogs.  SHE WANTS ALL THE ATTENTION.",

            "description": "Buster \u2013 A Handsome, Smart and Loyal German Shepherd\nSedona Shepherd Sanctuary is teaming up with Plainfield Humane Society to help save Buster, a handsome and friendly 7 year-old German Shepherd.  Buster is extremely intelligent and enjoys nothing more than to show off his obedience and retrieving skills.\n\nBuster is a pure bred German Shepherd with all the expected good looks of the breed.  He has lived with a family most of his life.  Unfortunately, in the past year, Buster had two bite incidents and was surrendered to the shelter.  According to his owner, the first occurred over some food that he took off a table outside his house, and the second when he was startled while being asleep.\n\nHe has been at the shelter since October and has been on his best behavior.  When we met Buster, he allowed us to walk right into his play area.  He then immediately engaged us with a toy in his mouth ready to play.  Buster will easily drop items and allow you to take toys out of his mouth.  He is comfortable with handling and does not show any signs of aggression.  He can however guard food, although he did not do so when we performed a food temperament test on him.  Buster allowed us to pet him and place fake hand near his bowl without incident.\n\nBecause Buster has a bite history on him, the shelter is only able to place Buster through a rescue.  Sedona is looking for a foster to adopt situation.   We believe that Buster has the temperament and personality to thrive in a loving home, someone with experience with the breed.   When outside of his run, Buster has interacted nicely with other dogs and is possible he could go to a home with other dogs.\n\nIf you are an experienced owner willing to give Buster a second chance, please fill out our adoption form or shoot us an email at contact@sedonashepherd.com for additional information.\n\nPlease note:\n\nSedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes. All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots\n\nOur adoption area includes New Jersey, Delaware Valley, Manhattan, Southern New York. We may adopt to Connecticut depending on circumstances. Please visit our website at www.sedonashepherd.com.\n\nSedona",

If you're looking for a playmate for a current dog in the home, I'm your girl! My foster mom says I could play ALL DAY LONG! I love to wrestle. I am a cat chaser, so no cats for me please!\n\nI may only be 29 lbs, but I am sometimes protective of my home and vocal with strangers. A home without children and limited foot traffic would be best, but my foster mom says I'm affectionate towards everyone I know! I am house trained and know the commands, sit, stay and down. I am crate trained during the day, and my foster family lets me stay out at night! \n\nApply at tailsandtrails.org",

What you will find, is a dog full of personality and one who is a blast to hang out with! Tarzan is a looker, no doubt! But he's so much more! He's happy all the time. He loves every moment he is outside the kennel and spending time with his human friends. As you can guess, Tarzan loves people. He hasn't met a stranger, yet! He likes to be outside and romp about, but he thinks it's okay to stay inside and cuddle, too. Tarzan would love to learn more about walking on a leash so he could take his person on neighborhood walks around the block. He'd also like to know more about commands and dog training. He understands knowledge is cool, and he's a cool dog! So who is ready to add this cool boy into their family? It only takes a trip to the shelter and meeting him!",

            "description": "Meet Ida!\n\n12-year-old Ida entered the San Diego Humane Society-Escondido as a stray and wasn't claimed. Ida sure was a happy girl in the car on her Freedom Ride. She enjoyed looking out the window and then took a nap, no doubt dreaming of her new life as a Frosted Face! Soon after we picked up Ida, we addressed her severe dental disease. She had 26 teeth removed, the remaining teeth cleaned, and now her mouth feels so much better! Ida is a sweet and quiet girl who has poor vision and hearing. She appreciates being approached gently to get her attention.\n\nIda went to live in a wonderful foster home over the holidays, and she has really blossomed with the love, patience, and enriching activities offered by her foster family.\n\nShe's potty trained, crate trained, sleeps through the night, not aggressive or bitey, rides well in the car, and is calm around other dogs. When Ida first arrived at her foster home, she was a little skittish and unengaged, but she has been steadily opening up and showing her cute personality to her foster family. Just over a month later, she is starting to snuggle, standing on her hind legs for treats, romping in the yard, and having zoomies!\n\nFor dogs like Ida, who seems to be in the early stages of dementia or cognitive dysfuction, it is important to still provide mental stimulation. Her foster family takes her on outings and introduces her to new places, people, dogs, and experiences, including a snuffle mat! A snuffle mat encourages sniffing and foraging for food, and Ida really took to it! As you can see in the video, Ida\n\n(red harness) had fun finding treats - and shared so nicely! - with her foster sister FF Macy (also looking for her forever home.)\n\nIda's foster mom shares, \"Her foster dad and I love her, and we know she's the perfect match for someone, idiosyncrasies and all. We're just waiting for that special someone to come along and give her a chance to be the goofy, quiet, low maintenance, adorable companion we know her to be. We know Ida isn't for everyone, but she'll be everything to someone. If you think you're Ida's someone, we can't wait to meet you!\"\n\nMight you be Ida's special someone? If you think you might be, please apply to meet her:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nCome visit our next Open House on Saturday & Sunday 10 AM - 1 PM.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 2/2/21 KG",

This Golden Retriever/ Newfoundland mix loves to walk and be outside, so a fenced yard would be ideal. He loves his foster, loves to be petted and likes to stay close to his family. Juno is 92 lbs and has a very sweet and easy-going disposition. He needs someone who works from home. This 10 year old boy with excellent house manners is not a demanding dog, he just prefers hanging out in the same room while you work or cook. Please contact Adopt a Golden Atlanta if you would like to learn more about this gentle giant.\n\n",

I am now in a wonderful foster home where I am getting good food, daily insulin shots, medical care that is needed and lots of TLC.  I am slowly putting on weight, which is a good thing, considering how severely under weight I was when I came into CiMAR.\n\nIf you'd like more information about me, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.

He is not good with other dogs and has been like that since he was a young pup.  Camo is an affectionate, calm, 6 year old gentleman who loves nothing more than leaning in for attention and petting.\n\nAlthough Camo enjoys a quick run in the yard, he is happier to take a long, brisk walk.  His leash manners are excellent, and he knows basic behavior cues.  He prefers human interaction to other animals, so he would be best as the only pet in the house. \n\nHis owner stated that he was good with children and could become protective of them.  Camo would fit into a home that would take him for frequent walks and allow him to  lay at their feet and be loved.\n\nDue to Covid, the shelter is has an appointment only policy. We ask potential adopters to fill out our application, prior to a scheduled meeting. The staff is very accommodating, and we welcome any inquires.\n\nThis link will take you to our adoption application.\nhttps://capemaycountynj.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5814/Adoption-Application",

I am a big boy weighing in at 95lbs and boy can I move...you should see me run and pounce around the dog arena chasing a tennis ball.  I am super playful and I know some basic commands and can sit and lay down...I also take a treat very nicely for a big boy! Although I lived in a home with other dogs and a cat, my owner kept me separated from the other dogs due to them being more dominant than myself. I have not had much experience around small children and therefore would do best in a home with an adult.  I do much better with women and I really don't care for men.  I am the type of dog who picks who I like....and hands down I pick women just about every time.",

            "description": "Sparky is a handsome male Labrador Retriever/Pit Bull mix who was surrendered by his owner on December 13, 2020 because he could not be trusted with a newborn infant in his home.  Sparky was adopted from HSOV in August 2017 and is approximately 8-9 years old at the present time.\n\nSparky has a white-and-black short smooth coat, a long tail, and an adorable (rather mischievous-looking face) with a large black patch around his right ear, a black button nose, and short semi-erect ears.  \n\nHis previous owner told us that Sparky was good with their older children (10-years+) but that he did not do well with their newborn infant (which is the reason he lost his home).  Sparky does NOT do well with other dogs or cats and should not go to a home with other animals.\n\nSparky is frightened of loud noises, vacuum cleaners, and water.  He usually seeks a more quiet place to get away from the noises or one where he feels safe.  \n\nSparky is a smart boy who knows several basic commands (sit, stay, down, and shake).  He tends to jump when he wants to give hugs :)   His favorite toys/activities are his purple dinosaur, rope toys, walks, snuggles, and taking naps.\n\nSparky has been kept indoors and is housebroken.  He enjoyed short walks each day with his family.\n\nHis owner wanted potential adopters to know that Sparky nips when he is excited, but that there is a big difference between his 'happy-to-see-you' nip and an actual bite.\n\nSparky is protective of his food but only shows aggression toward other animals who 'mess with his food bowl'.\n\nSparky weighs 68 lbs and is fairly strong/energetic on a leash.  He has already been neutered. Sparky would do best with an experienced handler (and a home where he could be an 'only child').\n\n",

My ID number is 335903.\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Bella! Sweet girl, Bella is looking for a permanent residence to call her own! This young girl has a lot of life ahead of her and mountains of potential to be a wonderful new friend! Bella came from a home that she shared with another canine and they did very well together! Bella, like all pets, deserve to be in a loving, safe and secure home, with compassionate owners, willing to give her all the time she needs to adjust!\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption. \n\n\n Primary Color: Grey Weight: 56lbs Age: 0yrs 6mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

Maverick is shy and a bit fearful in new situations and with new people but he warms up within a few days.and then wants to be everywhere that you are. Maverick does not like small children, according to his previous owner and that was one reason that she had to surrender him. She ran a daycare and Maverick just didnt warm up to the loud noises and sudden movements that young children make. Maverick has no issues with other dogs and cats are unknown. Maverick does have a cherry eye, which you can see in his picture but vet says that it is mostly a cosmetic issue and that repairing it can sometimes cause dry eye it does not bother him and is a fairly small one. Overall, Maverick is a healthy boy. He would do best in a home with older,children and/or adults. People who can give him his space and the time to adjust to his new surroundings without forcing themselves on him. Maverick does walk on a leash but does pull some. He is pretty strong considering his size. Maverick also likes to ride and will jump right into the vehicle. He does not like his nails trimmed or getting a rectal temperature (he did have to be muzzled by the vet for both of these procedures). Maverick will do really well with someone who can be home with him most of the time. Mavericks adoption fee will be $175 and will help to cover his cost of care while with us. If interested in giving Maverick his forever home, please submit your interest and adoption application or text ONLY to (352)215-3260 (phone calls will not be returned or answered at this number) for more information.",

He also does pretty well walking on a leash. \n\nIke does guard his food bowl and treats, so he needs an experienced adopter who will commit to working with him on this and knows how to instill leadership and limits with him.   Ike can also be mouthy and needs work on jumping, due to all of this, he needs to go to an adult only home. \n\nIf you are interested in Ike, please fill out an application at K9stray.com and we will be in touch. \n\n",

            "description": "Miss Chloe is around 4 years old and weighs in at h70 lbs. She is an English Bulldog mixed possibly with American Bully. CHLOE was dumped in the desert along with a male of similar breed and we think she was  possibly used for backyard breeding. She is SO sweet! This little girl just wants love, affection, and guidance. We don\u2019t believe Chloe was ever someone\u2019s \u201cpet.\u201d She came to us knowing few manners or basic commands,  but she is quickly progressing. \nShe is a fast learner and eager to please. Chloe would probably do best in a home with a submissive/playful dog. She likes to play with our Chihuahua and other more  \u201caloof\u201d-type dogs. Chloe is still learning some manners and is a little mouthy. We think she would probably do best in a home with older kids. She\u2019s a morning girl, waking up energetic and eager to play,  but her energy bursts are short-lived. Chloe hangs out contently in her kennel until it\u2019s time to come out and play again. If you think you can provide beautiful Chloe with her FOREVER home, please contact us. To get more information on a Pups On Parole dog, please contact a representative of the Lassen Humane Society at 530 251-7247 or e-mail ilovepopdogs@yahoo.com.  The Pups On Parole Program started in June of 2007 to help give homeless dogs a second chance at finding an adoptive family.  All dogs in the program spent time in our local county shelter, surrendered by their owners or picked up as strays and waiting for their owners to redeem them or to be adopted by new families.   The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.  To meet any of the Pups On Parole dogs, arrangements must be made in advance.",

Lady is around 2 years old and 25 lbs. Lady is sweet but very timid at first with new people and situations. She needs you to take it a little slower at first and let her come around at her own speed. Due to her being timid at first we don\u2019t recommend her for a home with small children or one out of the area where she would have to go on transport. Once settled she attaches to her person and is a complete Velcro dog. She does well on a leash and really is a good girl. She\u2019s playful and active. Lady is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and spayed! \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter!\n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue.

WE DON'T THINK SO - HE CAN BE NERVOUS AROUND PEOPLE AT FIRST. \nGood with strangers? WE DON'T THINK SO - HE CAN BE NERVOUS AROUND PEOPLE AT FIRST.\nHousebroken? UNKNOWN\nCrate-trained? UNKNOWN\nGood on leash? YES\nDo I have anxiety? NONE HAS BEEN OBSERVED \nDo I bark a lot? NO \nDo I have issues being handled? NO - NOT BY PEOPLE I TRUST\nDo I have a lot of energy? NO\nAm I shy? YES\nAm I outgoing? NO\nHave I displayed any kind of aggression? YES - PREVIOUS OWNERS STATE I GROWLED AT GUESTS THAT CAME OVER. WHEN MEETING NEW PEOPLE, I COWER AND LIP LICK (SIGNS OF STRESS). I HAVE MADE A LOT OF NEW FRIENDS SINCE BEING AT THE SHELTER, SO I AM CAPABLE OF LEARNING TO TRUST NEW PEOPLE. \nAm I more needy or more independent? UNKNOWN\nWhat do I like to work for when training? FOOD\n\n\nJasper is a special adoption dog because he struggles trusting new people. Previous adopters state that he attempted to bite house guests. While in shelter care, staff has had no problem interacting with him.\n\nIdeally, he would be placed in a quiet home with no kids or cats. New owner will have to accept him for his personality quirks.",

The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nGus is a sweet senior guy that just wants a lap and love.  He loves to lay in his bed or on the sofa with you. He is about 13.5 years old.  Gus weighs 12 pounds.  He is potty and crate trained.  He is fine with grooming. He lost quite a few teeth and needs to be on canned food.  He is good with other small dogs and cats.  Due to some vision and hearing loss, he is not recommended for a home with small, active kids or dogs as he just wants to chill in his old age.   \n\nHe is available at the end of January unless you can get him to his vet in Conroe for his last vet appt. \n He is neutered, up to date on shots, hw negative, microchipped and just had a dental. \n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

He likes all people and can run and play with dogs all day long. He loves attention as well as hanging out and snuggling.\n\nBut, he is guarding of his humans around dogs. He has to be redirected from pushing other dogs away. For this reason, he needs to be an only dog. This behavior can be trained out of him but it takes time and a patient other dog. He is a beautiful bot and so eager to please.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are fully wormed, receive rabies and core vaccinations, microchipped, behavior assessed with other dogs and humans (sorry, no cat testing is done here), spend a minimum of 3 weeks free-ranging within a pack of 30 dogs to grow confidence and trust and may have DNA results. All dogs receive lifetime behavior support and can be returned anytime without a fee.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You MUST complete an adoption application in order to see or adopt a dog from us. The completed adoption application ensures your 'spot' in order of adoption. Emailing/calling with questions will delay your adoption process.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION --> www.petsreturnhome.org/adoption-application",

He is fearless, has a big personality, can be willful and strong headed, but is very willing to please. This just means he needs a dog savvy, experienced leader. He is now ready to find his perfect family!\n\nFinn is about 3 years old and well trained!  He has a high energy level and high drive that requires an active family/owner with lots of exercise and structure. Finnley has been socialized around other dogs, but can be dog selective at times, so he will do best as an only dog.  His ideal home will provide lots of exercise and structure. NO kids please. He was failed by a rescue that brought him North and placed him in an unsuitable home where he was not allowed any time to decompress and pre-teen kids in the home teased him and were unkind to him. Due to his past traumas & unkind treatment Finnley cannot be dealt with in a harsh/forceful manner, but rather needs someone who is calm, patient, consistent and confident.\n\nFinnley is a great best friend & active companion for the right dog lover.\n\nWant to meet Finn?

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Healthy adult maleTaz is a really good companion dog. He listens very well, knows commands and loves people he knows. It takes him a little bit before he warms up to new people - but it happens quickly. He does not bite a human - he gives a ferocious bark - good for strangers. He is barrier frustrated so it would be good for him to have a wooden fence if kept in the backyard for long periods of time. He absolutely loves human affection and touch. He is very playful.\n\nHe needs a strong person to be his leader. He is not good with other dogs, however. He will break off if commanded and can be redirected easily before engagement - but he needs an experienced dog handler for his new owner.\n\nPlease come visit Taz and check him out - He is a mighty handsome Boy.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are fully wormed, receive rabies and core vaccinations, microchipped, behavior assessed with other dogs and humans (sorry, no cat testing is done here), spend a minimum of 3 weeks free-ranging within a pack of 30 dogs to grow confidence and trust and may have DNA results. All dogs receive lifetime behavior support and can be returned anytime without a fee. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: You MUST complete an adoption application in order to see or adopt a dog from us. The completed adoption application ensures your 'spot' in order of adoption. Emailing/calling with questions will delay your adoption process.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION --> www.petsreturnhome.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Thompson is a sweet 9 year old cocker boy whose had a rough life but we will be changing that for him STARTING NOW! Thompson gets along great with everyone and is happiest just taking in all the activities of his four legged friends. He could stand to lose a few pounds and his eyesight isn't the best but he will still be first at the kitchen table and for petting and snuggle time....his slow shuffle has turned into a confident trot and we are looking forward to seeing this  boy going from a \"shut down shelter rescue\" to a confident and loved member of someone's family. If you are interested in adopting Thompson please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org. Thompson is still being treated for some medical issues so we will do a foster-to-adopt situation for the right family- in this way Thompson gets to be in a loving home and we pay for his medical care until he is medically cleared.   ADOPTION FEE: $200.00\n",

Stark will need someone who can understand his behaviors and also someone who understands his energy level.  He play bites and nibbles and sometimes can get into it with other dogs due to his playfulness and excited state.  He needs a family who is active.  If the family has another dog, a meeting with that other dog will be required.  It is best the other dog be laid back and not be alpha.  Stark could probably benefit from an obedience class.  He is very smart and loves to play.  Stark is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on his vaccinations.

Hans is a sweet 5-year-old Pit Bull Mix, who will make an incredibly loyal companion. He is affectionate by nature, loves hugs, and will blindside you with sloppy kiss when you least expect it. Hans is potty trained and knows some of his basic commands. We are unsure how he would do in a home with other dogs or cats. \n\nHans Gruber is the perfect holiday treat! He can\u2019t wait to bust out of Nakatomi Plaza and come hold your heart hostage for 600 million kisses!

            "description": "GUMMO AND JOJO UPDATE!!\n\nMeet Jojo & Gummo. These sweet girls were surrendered to the local shelter. They were absolutely terrified at the shelter and we were asked to help.  These sweet girls are Chi mixes. Jojo is 6 lbs and Gummo is 9 lbs. Since being in foster care they have come out of their shell a lot. Gummo is still very timid and will need a calmer household but Jojo is a talker and totally full of herself. These sweet girls are bonded. We really want to find them a home together. They both do great with other animals. They love fluffy beds and to sunbathe. They will use a doggy door as well. They are utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and will be spayed before placement. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

ORANGE\u2013 Dogs in the ORANGE category are commonly timid and will need some confidence building at first. Once dogs in the ORANGE category are comfortable, they will most likely be energetic and needing similar guidance to dogs that are in the YELLOW category. Dogs in the ORANGE category sometimes benefit from another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

            "description": "Handsome Remington came to PACC as a stray with some injuries and was more than happy to let our friendly clinic staff patch him up so he could get to feeling better. Now that he's on the mend, Remington has got plenty of pep in his step and is hoping to finish up his recovery in a home instead his kennel here at the shelter. Remington is a sweet boy who isn't letting the cone of shame get him down. Staffers tell us he's friendly and sweet and while he's a slow walker, he's easy to leash up and walks politely. We don't know a lot about Remington, but we're looking forward to learning more about him if he's around long enough for us to get to know him. A few things we're sure of are that this sweet boy likes pets and treats and would love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If Remington sounds like your type of guy, make an appointment to meet him today.",

She should not go to a home with small dogs as she has issues with them.\n\nShe recently had a litter of puppies and her puppies were rescued out of the shelter and she was left behind :(. She is an amazing girl!! She goes in her crate and sleeps all night and has not shown any signs of food aggression. She is about 60 pounds and just craves attention. She would be great with an active household with lots of outdoor activities and a yard. She is house trained and learning how to use a dog door. She would be a wonderful addition to a loving household!\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

He loves a good squeak toy as well. He\u2019s perfect on a leash or in a harness.\n\nJefferson has done well with his foster brother who is a senior dog, and would do well in a home without an alpha dog.

He got tangled up in some bushes and was stuck, so I ran back and forth across the road until a nice lady stopped to help. I went right up to her to let her know I was nice, then went back to the bushes. She didn't understand what I wanted or why I wouldn't go with her, so my Pug friend let out a little bark. Then the nice lady followed me and freed my friend! I immediately checked him over and gave them both tons of kisses since he was safe! The nice lady says I'm \"truly amazing\" and \"beyond friendly.\" She's pretty awesome, too! Even though I loved my friend, I'd prefer a home with no other pets. I want to be the star in your life! I am a very affectionate and energetic girl. I love attention, and am VERY loyal to my friends! With my happy-go-lucky attitude, I'm not afraid of strangers. They're just playmates I haven't met! I am crate trained, and won't destroy your things when you leave. I also know \"sit,\" and am good with baths and nail trims. Your neighbors will like me, too, because I'm not very vocal. I'm so eager to find my forever home! Is it with you?? Fill out an application today so we can meet! ...",

            "description": "TECO is one of the electric company pups.  He wants to light up your life :)\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Dec. 2017, TECO weighs under 20 lb.  He's scheduled for neuter surgery the end of Dec. so should be ready in early January for God to send his forever family.\n\nTECO is house-trained when taken out on a regular schedule - currently every 2 hours.  He is learning crate and leash manners.  He's affectionate and gets along with the other dogs in his pack.  \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "Hello! Have you ever seen a dog as adorable as me?! Can you believe I\u2019m homeless and am waiting for a wonderful person or family to adopt me? Great dogs like me end up in animal shelters every day- I know, it\u2019s so hard to believe but it\u2019s true!\n\nMy name is Colby and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center from the sunny state of Florida. I'm around 7 years old, about 42 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nThe staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! I have been enjoying the scenic grounds here at PAC as well as socializing with my fellow dogs. Even at 7 years old, I am a bouncy and playful gentleman. I enjoy pets and cuddles from the staff and volunteers (check out my photos!). I get to go on car rides. I'm a great passenger -- not to brag. I have the best time exploring and hiking the nearby trails.\n\nThe staff thinks my ideal home would be with humans who are 18 & older. While I am friendly with some special dog pals here at PAC, I would prefer to be the only dog in the home. You see, I like to be spoiled and get all the attention. I did well on my cat test, so I could live with a cat roommate with a slow introduction!\n\nWhat do you say? Can we be best buds? Please complete an adoption profile (found here - https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) and email to my contact at PAC at cmuller@providenceac.org. My people will be in touch!\n\nTail wags and smiles,\n\nColby\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day.

He is food motivated but needs training to work on basic commands and taking treats softly. For that reason he would do best in a home with kids 10 and up. No cats for Dutch please they are too much of a toy for him.

We rescued this 9-year-young senior boy from the streets after reports came in of his owner passing away suddenly. He was living in this cardboard box, with fleas, ticks, skin infections, and teeth rotting so bad, he could barely eat. We immediately got his skin treated, many of his teeth pulled and his skin, eyes and ears looked at and cleared up. Winnie is a beautiful poodle mix who is beyond precious, so sweet and ready for the next amazing phase of his life. His foster mom says he loves to sleep on pillows, loves to go on walks and of course loves to be loved and paid attention to. He definitely needs a forever home with a parent who works from home (pre-COVID) or is retired and will give a lot of love to Winnie. Though Winnie is good with other calm, older dogs, he prefers all the love and attention to himself.\n\nOur adoption fee for all dogs is $500 and is tax deductible as we are a 501(c)(3) rescue. Our rescue also includes a microchip and keeps vaccinations up to date.\n\nIf you're interested in Winnie, you must visit our website and fill out an application here: https://bigloveanimalrescue.org/adoption-application-form/\n\n**No meet and greets prior to approved application.\n\n**Due to the volume of messages we receive on all of our platforms, we do not send follow up emails to our applicants and we do not read or reply to messages via PetFinder. We\u2019re a small, volunteer ran rescue so we can only do so much in 24 hours. Thank you for understanding!\n\nAgain, please no repeat emails. If we feel you're the right fit, we will contact you.\n\nwww.bigloveanimalrescue.org\n",

            "description": "Apollo\nGreat Dane mix\nFive years old, 54 pounds, \nNeutered, fully vaccinated, hw negative and microchipped. \n\nLooking for the ultimate cuddle bug?\n\nThis handsome guy is Apollo (5-years-old), and what brings him the most joy in life is laying beside - or often on - you on the couch. He's the perfect mixture of couch potato snuggle bug and playful tug-of-war champion.\n\nWhen Apollo is really happy, he gives you a grin, wiggles around, and sneezes. He just can't contain his excitement!\n\nApollo is a bit reserved and appreciates, at least for now while he gets comfortable again, meeting people with slow introductions. A couple sniffs to make sure you're okay, and he's ready for some pets. This big boy is smarter than he lets on but is still nervous about his outdoor surroundings, so he needs a strong leader to keep up his training.\n\nApollo is a great house dog: house broken, crate trained (though he is fine to be loose in the house), distinguishes between toys and non-toys, and is careful to watch your fingers when you're playing. He does believe he's your sous chef, so don't be surprised if he shadows you in the kitchen! Also, Apollo would love a backyard so he can get out his zoomies and lounge in the sun.\n\nApollo would benefit from being an only animal so he can soak up all your love himself. Though he is fine with big dogs with proper introductions, he prefers to hang with humans. He may not be around small dogs or cats.  If you are interested in adopting Apollo, please email adoptsch@gmail.com or message the Second Chance Habitat Facebook page.",

He does have some separation anxiety and is working on crate training and independence.   He does take a longer time to open up to men so patience will be needed if there are men in the home. He does have a bite history so cannot be in a home with children; he can coexist with dogs but does resource guard his person and what he feels is his area so it's best that he be the only dog in the home. Cooper is really a love bug and once he opens up he is a gentle and sweet boy! He needs a home with someone that is around often and able to provide him with structure and boundaries so he can continue to thrive.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

You might notice that I'm a big girl.  I used to live with a kind gentleman that had dementia who loved me very much, and I loved him very much.  He would feed me ... and feed me again ... and feed me again .... and well, you get the picture.  I couldn't be rude, so of course I'd eat it all up!  My family decided that this just wasn't healthy for me, so they reached out to The Rescued Rescuers.  You see, I came into rescue at 30 lbs, and I should weigh half that, maybe less.  That's a lot of extra weight for my little frame to carry!  Foster mom has me on a diet (booo) and gentle walkies to help me lose some weight and then do brisker walkies.  I have a vet visit next week to get me all checked out and we didn't want to over-do things without getting me checked first.  Despite the diet (boooo) I'm doing well in my foster home.  I get along fine with the other pups. There's even crazy foster kittens running around, and I don't mind them either.  You might think that with me being a big girl, that I would be very food motivated.  Nope.  What makes me happiest in the world is attention from my humans.  Could you be that human that would be my forever home?  You would need to commit to continuing my weight loss and keeping me at a healthy weight.  But I would pay for that responsibility with total adoration!  \n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application\n",

All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them.

All of her other pals have since been adopted and we don\u2019t understand why this sweet girl hasn\u2019t! Eudora has come a long ways since she was first rescued. She loves people of all ages!! She is so friendly and tries to sit as close to you as possible. During her stay with us, she has also played mother hen to several liters of puppies! She is so wonderful with them. Eudora has gained some weight since being rescued, maybe a little too much now. But this poor girl is realizing she doesn\u2019t have to beat out 70 other dogs to eat. \n\nLike mentioned above, Eudora is as sweet as they come! While she is very friendly with people, she does have a few fears to still overcome. We have been working on getting her used to a leash and going on walks. That is still a work in progress. She is also getting used to car rides. Since that wasn\u2019t anything she had every experienced before in her life, she does get a little car sick. We are hoping with some time and patience, she can learn to overcome that! \n\nOverall, Eudora is just a great girl who finally needs a home to call her own!",

He loves to follow you around and take naps on laps. \n\nHe is hard of hearing and has a bad eye, so is easily startled. He needs his new forever home where he will be loved and pampered and snuggled with. He appears to be house trained as well. \n\nThis guy is a treasure and would make a great companion.\n\nHis adoption fee of $225, includes all his vetting.\n\nTo be considered for adopting Elijah, please complete an adoption application at our website:\nchloespetrescue.org",

She is 5 years old  More details below.\n\n**During the current health situation**\n\nIf you are interested in ADOPTING from the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, please email the shelter manager, Becky Snyder at rsnyder@edisonnj.org and she will send you an application to fill out and discuss potentially setting up a meeting. The subject of the email should be \"Adoption - Pet's Name\". Thank you. Be safe and stay healthy.\n\nADOPT ME!  Say hello to PRETTY VICKI. She is an AFFECTIONATE, ENERGETIC, FRIENDLY Rottweiler mix. She is approximately 5 years old and would love to have a HOME of her own! She came in as a stray and was very underweight. She definitely does NOT like cats and also does not seem all that fond of other dogs. We are making the recommendation that she be the only pet in the home and no small children. Vicki needs to go to an experienced adopter and would not be the dog for you if you are a first-time adopter.\n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nFor our shelter updates, check out Friends of the Edison Animal Shelter Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/edisonanimalshelter\n\nTo view all of the Edison Animal Shelter's available pets on Petfinder (which includes pictures and bios), please click on the following link: https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=NJ593\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/edisonshelter/?igshid=1b8ab04w24mb6\n",

He was at a Wyoming shelter for some time, and we were lucky enough to get him into our program. He is a gem. He gets along great with his other dog foster siblings, and plays well with them all. He is a little too interested in cats, so he cannot live with one. The older kids he has been around he has done well with. He came in a little underweight, but his foster family is doing a wonderful job getting weight put back on him. He can get a little nervous in chaotic environments, but has been adjusting well to his new foster home.

I run, jump, play and explore from the time I wake up till the time I go to bed. I need an active home with school aged kids that can play with me. A fenced yard would be a HUGE plus so I can run and run.   \n\nMom says that I'm doing good with housebreaking. I love any and all toys. I always have something in my mouth as I run through the house. \n\nFrom my foster mom: Some family  is going to be amazingly lucky. Sasha is one of the most loveable dogs we have ever fostered. Are you the family for her? And by the way, she can leap into your arms from the floor!!\n\nTo be considered the first step is to apply here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton \n\nWe are located in Joliet Illinois and require adopters be within a 100 mile radius to adopt. If your application is picked we will be in touch by phone to set up a private meet. Information on fees can be found here:\nhttps://www.pawsup4rescue.org/adoptions",

He will need a home with children 14 and older due to his energy level. We are unsure how he is with other dogs and cats at this time.

It killed them to let me go since I am the bestest boy, but they know at Five Acres I'll get the help that I deserve! I need a confident owner who will show me how to behave when stressed out by other dogs. Because of my fears the staff thinks I would do best in a single dog home and with no younger kids! I promise you won't miss having little ones in the house because I'll give you all the snuggles you could want! Please come see me today at the Pralle location!",

            "description": "Fynn, 8 months old and 25 lbs., is a petite sweetheart of a Potcake (what Bahamians call local island strays) from Abaco, Bahamas. Fynn was found on the streets and raised in a local foster home for the past two months before finding his way to our organization in NY. He is currently in foster care in Fairfield, CT where he is slowly opening up to his human foster parents. He LOVES other dogs and will need a home outside of the city with another dog companion as this is where he finds his best confidence. His adopters should be patient and gentle and give him some time to trust and not be so shy/fearful. Fynn is not aggressive or reactive at all, he just needs a patient family to wait for him to open up. When he does, the love is incredible. A fenced in backyard is important for Fynn..\n\nPlease email elli@mrbonesandco.org with questions. To meet Fynn, please complete an adoption at www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt first. Fynn is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. His adoption fee is $500.00. You can see all his social media posts under #AdoptFynnMBC\n\nThank you!",

I take to commands quickly and loves to run around! Squeeker toys are my favorite in the house but I don't know how to play fetch or tug of war yet! Toys that are soft are really my bread and butter. I'm a leash puller so I'd do really well with a harness if you can find one that fits me and my barrel chest! I've seem to have had at least one litter of pups before coming to the shelter. I'm a gentle girl who love to rub my head against your legs. I'm good with my crate and like to sleep in there on a big soft pillow but you might find yourself waking up in the morning with me leaning against you. I don't know the right ways to tell other dogs or kids I may be uncomfortable. Some dogs like me just do not understand Covid #2020 bubble boundaries...\nI'll be a lovely and loyal girl to you and your family with smiles for days!\n\nIf you have previously applied with us please email mars.apc.dept@gmail.com to reactivate your application with new interest.\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree.

This vivacious pup adores playing and having fun, especially if it means he can run fast and play fetch. If it allows him to be active and burn off his excess energy, he is in! Fric also loves to give kisses and cuddle up with people! He is incredibly affectionate and friendly, though his enthusiasm for new friends causes him to jump with excitement, so he's looking for a patient, attentive family that can help him keep his eagerness in check and find his calm. Fric will thrive in an active home where he can shine as the only pet and continue to learn and grow. If you're looking for an adorable dog with an unmatched zest for life, look no further! Come out and meet Fric today! \n\nFric is currently located at the Sanctuary in Marion, WI. If you're interested in making Fric part of your family, please complete an online application. Our adoption team will review it. When an application is approved, we will be in touch to schedule a time for you to meet him.",

I have been very cautious since being here on the ranch but that is because I'm not quite used to my surroundings yet and I came from a very challenging environment. I like to play with other dogs but I can be selective with who I choose to engage with. I would definitely be happiest living in an adult-only home, but I may be able to live happily with a feline friend or two. I'd be a good fit for an experienced dog owner who can help me learn that it is ok to come out of my shell. While I am very cautious, I am open to interactions with new people. I would be an excellent apartment dog and would be perfectly happy living a quiet lifestyle with my new owners. I would benefit from further training, but I do appear to have some understanding of potty-training. I know that I would make an excellent cuddle buddy if you would just give me the chance to prove it to you!",

Charlie loves to play & learn new things for treats! \n\nWe think Charlie will do best in a home with kids 8+. At this time we recommend he be the only pet. He is not suitable for apartment living. \n\nThis is an adult dog and the adoption cost is $150, which covers microchip, age appropriate vaccines, and spaying or neutering.\n\n Come out to meet all of our adoptable animals today! ----------------------------------- \n\nThis dog is at Midlands Humane Society located at 1020 Railroad Avenue, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 Please email or call them at 712-396-2270 midlandshumanesociety@gmail.com http://midlandshumanesociety.org/ Hours of Operation:\nMonday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,Friday 12:00pm - 6:00pm Saturday 11:00am-5:00pm\nSunday 11:00am-3:00pm",

Duke is a boxer/hound mix who is 10 years old.  When he arrived at the shelter, his body score was 2/5, but he is progressing well.   Duke was not doing well at the shelter and was growling in some situations.  He is much happier when he is not in a kennel or being restrained.   Duke has done better with handling.  Duke will need a dog savvy adopter who is willing to give Duke time to settle in and feel safe.   He is a special boy who has not had a good life so far.   AAU wants to change that for him.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MEETING DUKE FOR POSSIBLE FOSTER OR ADOPTION, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

I am completely blind, but it doesn't slow me down.  I would love a doggie door because I like exploring outside.  If I get lost, I scratch on the closest door for you to come to find me.  I'm fully crate trained.  I am good with stairs, but I need someone to tell me \"step\".  I'm very quiet... When I'm excited to meet someone I sound like a chipmunk.  I don't bark.  Best dog ever!",

If this sounds like you or someone you know, please spread the word so we can help find Dash his forever home. \n\nDash is a 3 year old pit mix looking for his forever home. Dash had had a rough start to life but Is hopeful someone has room in their heart to give him his happily ever after he so deserves. Dash was from a hoarding case down south where the rescue closed and left 85 dogs and over 60 cats to fend for themselves. He spent almost a year there and was kept in an outdoor run. He had limited access to food and water, and no access to love. This shaped him, but didn't break him.\n\n Dash has started to make some progress in his foster home, but has a long way to go. Dash is looking for a home who either has experience in working with dogs with severe anxiety, or willingness to work with a specialist. Ongoing training will be a requirement for his adoption. Dash is hoping for a home with structure, time, patience but most importantly love. He's available for adoption at rescuegang.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nAce adores curling up on the couch, affording the 53-pound black beauty a paw-fect view of the activities inside his foster home. As the 1.5-year-old former stray grows accustomed to the feeling of safety and the knowledge that a human touch can be tender, he's allowed his foster mom to pet his head more often and leash him for the walks he now likes, never pulling and always walking beside her. Not only has he discovered the joys of taking treats and playing with toys but he thrives on playing outdoors with his canine foster sisters. While he knows no commands as yet, he sleeps in his crate and is housetrained to use a doggy door. With so much to learn and so much potential, what Ace needs now is a home, with patient adopters to earn his trust, educate him fully and ensure that he's well loved and well exercised fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet, the next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives! A home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $300. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking here . We want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time. Our adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

            "description": "Blitz is an 8-year-old Podengo who is just as sweet as it gets! He is in excellent health for his age and loves going for walks. He gets along well with other dogs that he has met but he really prefers females over males and especially other Podengos!\nBlitz is not house-trained yet but is working on it. He is looking for a foster or adoptive home that is up for continuing his training. Blitz can be skittish in new situations and is a flight risk so a home where he will not get the opportunity to ever be outdoors without a leash is a must. He can easily climb fences and escape IF there is an opportunity to do so. He is a crafty guy! If you think you might be a good fit for Blitz, email us for more information about fostering to adopt at adopt@scituateanimalshelter.org \n\nAll dogs are fixed, vaccinated, dewormed, flea treated and heartworm/lyme tested before adoption. Adoption fees are $360 for a dog, $460 for a puppy, and $250 for a dog with special needs or senior over 10 years old.\n",

Zoey doesn't like small animals like cats or rabbits and needs to be in a home without these critters. \n\nZoey's new home should only have females in the home because she is very wary of men. If she is with a woman and a man is nearby, she will assume she needs to  protect the woman and will act aggressively towards the man. Without men around, Zoey is very calm and sweet. \n\nIf you think you might be a good match for her, email us at adopt@scituateanimalshelter.org for more info on fostering or adopting this girl.",

            "description": "--Bean is a 6 year old, 55 lb, neutered male. He is a gorgeous guy with a crooked smile who loves to be around his people. He is very calm and likes other dogs similar in size. Although he has never had an issue with any dog he has met here (and he has met a lot!) he would probably most enjoy another calm, chill partner in crime. Bean is a little TOO interested in cats and small animals, including small dogs, and is not recommended to go home with these. He walks well on a leash and is just as happy outside as he is indoors by your side. He gets very excited eating his treats and can be a little grabby at times. All in all, Bean is just a good ol' boy who wants to spend the rest of his life by your side. **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

She is about 90 lbs. but doesn't look that big! She is basically an outside dog. Her room is our heated 4 seasons room off the kitchen. She grew up with the doggie door to come and go into our fenced back yard. She is a very sweet dog that loves people. She has been around young kids a few times but not enough to say how she would be with young kids. She has stayed with my sons dachshund a lot over the years. She has also played with other Labs. She likes to play and run around the yard. We are moving to a small condo on the third floor and know that she needs a yard and to be outside. So if you are looking for a loving dog and have access to a yard for to run please contact me.",

She is a fun, playful sweet, active girl who appears to be housebroken. She will most likely make a great family pet, her finder says she was good with her kids and other dogs. She needs a secured fenced yard where she can have supervised exercise and playtime and the rest of the time spent indoors. She does need a little training to stop her from trying to bolt out a door, so something to keep in mind. She will make a great addition to your new pet family.\n\nOlivia has tested POSITIVE for Heartworms. She has been started on daily medications for the slow kill method and her adopter will need to keep her maintained on monthly Heartworm prevention for the rest of her life.\n\nOlivia is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella, been dewormed and is microchipped. \n\nOlivia has now been spayed as of 12/17/20 and received her required Rabies vaccination. She is ready for her new home.\n\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928. The shelter is open Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri from 12:00pm - 6:00pm and on Sat from 12:00pm - 4:00pm.",

He particularly loved zipping around being a big goofball in the outside kennels and eating the clean icy/snow out on the trail during his morning walk. He is such a sweet lovable goofball, once you meet him - you will LOVE him.\nHercules is a big boy at 95 pounds; he is about a year and a half old.  Hercules will sit while he waits for treats, which he takes nicely.  He absolutely loves being pet, he is friendly and playful.\nHe will be sure to provide plenty of affection and entertainment for one lucky family but Hercules will need to be the only pet in his forever home.  Due to his size we recommend any children in his forever home are 12 years old and up.  \n\nObedience classes required*\n\nIf handsome Hercules sounds like he could be the dog for you, please fill out an adoption application at: https://wishbonepetrescue.org/",

She lived with children and is gentle. She is spayed and up to date with all vaccines. Her skin was in bad condition when she came to us, but with the proper medication, baths, and care she is improving every day. Please apply to adopt Baby Girl at Rescueridge.com and if your application is a possible match a volunteer will get back to you within 72 hours. Baby Girl can go home with Brutus but is dog selective with other dogs. Best as an only pet in the home or can go home with Brutus.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Caramel is an American Staffordshire Terrier/Lab mix that just had his official first birthday with us on January 1! He is very friendly to people and curious enough to explore people, places, noises, and things when he's secure and loves to lean on his handler. So much fun! His adorable face means he gets away with more than he should!\n\nTHE GOOD:\nknows basic commands sit, stay (for a moment), down (for jumping), has learned he's not allowed any counter, table, or food that basically smells the best. Loves being with his humans, so will not run away. Intelligent, friendly, playful, and would love to be a lap dog!\n\n>>LEARNING:\ngreeting behavior (we discourage jumping), crate training (ok at night but does not like to be alone too long in the house), chewing dos and dont's, proper leash behavior (we use an extra long leash, the gentle leader, and a short leash for public outings). Proper pal play (too aggressive for most dogs so far)\n\n>>FAVORITES:\nwalks are good but runs are better, fetch is ok, but tug of war is better, adults ok, but kids are better, cuddles and snuggles are best, but will take a lean or a paw on you until he is happy.\n\nTHE BAD:\nneeds a lot of oral stimulation. Loves any chew toy, but is just as happy to chew masks, socks, and dog beds. Not great at a dog park since he is an aggressive player. We're hopeful he'll learn manners soon. Can be a barker and/or a digger without enough stimulation.\n\nTHE UGLY:\nWilling to make anything into a game, which makes discipline a challenge.\n\n=========================================================\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\n\nPuppies\nthat are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations.\n\nChildren under 8 years old\noften are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

            "description": "Just look into those beautiful eyes, and you will see that Willet WANTS to trust and love you. His anxiety about strangers, however, can make that a frustratingly slow process. Once he has accepted you, he is affectionate, playful, loyal, snuggly, and attention-seeking. He has good house manners, takes treats enthusiastically, and is always gentle. But it can take him several days to determine that a new person is familiar and trustworthy enough to let his guard down. When he encounters a newcomer in his home or on his property, Willet will bark intently, pacing and following the 'intruder,' staying close enough to keep an eye on him/her, but just out of arm's reach. Neither treats nor soothing words distract him. This makes him a great guard dog, but it's challenging for a home that gets visitors. Off home turf, Willet is more passive toward strangers but shows his overall fear by recoiling, trembling, and seeking to avoid any contact. In his foster home, he has started working on basic training to give him confidence and help him learn how to focus. Being just 2 years old, Willet is energetic and bouncy, enjoys playing with toys, and loves running around the yard, especially if there is a squirrel to chase. Willet would love to romp and play with his canine foster brother, but Robin isn't much of a player, especially since Willet, at 32 lbs., is more than twice Robin's size and often jostles and knocks him around. When Robin then gets testy about this, Willet just good-naturedly ignores him. Aside from some competitive marking in his first few days in foster care, Willet's house-training has been very good, and he uses the dog door like a pro. Willet is seeking a low-traffic household with understanding, dog-savvy humans, who are committed to positive training, so that he can continue his journey to being the best, most loyal companion ever. If that describes you and your home and if you feel drawn to helping Willet feel safe, check out his online album at https://imageevent.com/beales/fosters/willet . Be sure to read all the captions, where you can learn more details about this intriguing boy with the soulful eyes.\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

            "description": "Note: I require another canine companion within the household that will actively interact with me and 'show me the ropes'.\n\nHey everyone!!! I just got flown in from Puerto Rico. Let me tell you, that was a heck of a scary trip! \n    \nMy name is Canela. I\u2019m 2 years old and 30lbs! I am here looking for a fantastic family to make me their forever dog. Let me tell you my list of wants in my forever family.....\n    \nI am very shy meeting new people so I need that special family that understands that it takes time for me to know I am at my forever home. I can be nippy when I get super scared but I come around with patience. I have good house manners once I get on a schedule and you pay attention to my cues.  I'm the kinda girl that once I feel I can trust my family I will do everything to please you. I walk good on a leash but all new things make me nervous. Just know I am working on that. I need a secure yard or walked on a leash. I LOVE other dogs, toys, and my foster family that is showing me the ropes. Lastly, I will do best in a dog experienced home. \n      \nDon't pass me up cause I need more time than some dogs cause I definitely have as much love and personality as an outgoing dog. Remember to give me 3 days to settle in, 3 weeks to learn my routine, and 3 months to know I am yours forever!\n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \n Our adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

His previous owner did not properly care for him and he was surrendered to our local vet. We have gotten him up to date on vaccines, fundraised for his leg removal surgery and had him neutered. \nHe does not do well with cats, smaller dogs or young children. \nHe hasn\u2019t done great with male dogs but he only very recently was neutered. He loves having a companion. Currently he is staying with a Paws for a Cause dog and loving playing with her.  His interactions with female dogs have gone very well. \nNot sure about children.\nHe is just over a year old, crate trained and very smart.\nHe will REQUIRE a fenced area to run.",

I guess I didn't get enough to eat when I was a stray on the street so my foster mom is working on getting more weight on me.  I can run like the wind and jump too \u2013 so much fun! But I do require an escape-proof fence, at least 4' high. I need another dog in my new home, since I am a bit shy and would be the happiest girl ever to have someone to run and play with me \u2013 I have so much energy to share. My other life was not very good, as when I was a stray on the street,  I was found with a bullet wound through my chest that was badly infected. Thankfully, I was treated and rehabbed and you would never have guessed that happened. I am a bit jumpy around loud noises, but I\u2019m sure you can understand that \u2013 those guns are really loud. I am so happy that I might find my own person as I am very affectionate and love to snuggle on the couch. I will be watching for applications so we can have so much fun playing in the yard with you and another friend.\n\nAll of our adoptable pets live with foster families in a family environment so we know their individual temperament and personality. This helps us to match the right dog with the right family to make sure everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nIf would like to adopt this dog, or another one of our dogs, please click on the application link on our home page to download our application. Please save the application to your computer and email it to Beagle911rescue@aol.com as an attachment.\n\nIf you would like to open your home to help other dogs in need, or you'd like to help with adoption events, walking dogs, etc., we are always looking for fosters and volunteers. If you are interested, please download our Foster or Volunteer application from our home page.",

My favorite thing to do is be wherever you are, and I never turn down a cuddle; my foster mom says, I think I'm a lap dog. I love playing tug of war and would enjoy a back yard to sunbathe in. I'm an older guy, so I don't get into many things, but I have had a rougher past, so I didn't have the opportunity to learn some of the more basic commands when I was young. However, I am very smart and treat motivated, so I'm open to learning. I would do best in a home with older children and no small dogs or cats. If you have a more social lifestyle with meeting new people and lots of car rides to new adventures, I'm down for the ride. I love everyone I meet, so I'm good at being in new environments, and I'm great with car rides. In this stage of my life, I want to find a family to love, so give me a chance I won't disappoint.

The shelter reached out to NMAF as soon as he arrived as the poor little guy was just terrified.  His first week in foster care has seen him venture, only seldom, out of his crate - he is completely unsure and still quite timid but, when he wants affection, he is a true lover!  We believe he may have been isolated to a crate or small space his entire life but think, given time and a patient person to call his own, he will emerge a sweet & loving companion.  He does not show interest in other dogs so would be fine as an only dog - perhaps as a companion for a still-active senior or couple.  He is sweet and easy to have around.  He will be neutered on December 17th and receive the rest of his medical requirements at that time so could be ready to go to his new home by Christmas.  In order to meet him, an application is required.  See details and link above.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

It only took one touch for her foster mom to give her the name Velvet, as her coat is soft, dense, and shiny.  The shelter had listed her as a Pomeranian mix, which is possible, but she is much larger (we estimate between 15 & 20 pounds) and long-legged.  Schipperkes, a Belgian breed, seem to match her better than Pomeranian, including her temperament, though there is definitely something else mixed in.  What a fun DNA experiment she will make!  Schipperkes are affectionate, smart (though not necessarily easy to train), and require regular exercise.  They are also good with children, though we have not had an opportunity to test that.  A better weight will be obtained when she is spayed and receives the rest of her medical requirements, including a heartworm test.  She is a self-possessed little girl, quiet and calm, and gets along with the other dogs in her foster home.  Cats are unknown.  She is well-mannered and easy to have around.  Once she is spayed, she may be ready to go to her Furrever Home by Christmas as long as she is kept quiet a few more days.  In order to meet her, an application is required.  See information & link above.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

On top of her mental anxieties, she is heartworm positive, and receiving treatment, so her exercise must be limited and she must have frequent vet appointments. Her spay is scheduled for December 18. \nShe definitely seems to prefer the company of men over women at the moment. She is crate trained but obviously needs a spacious home and a large fenced in yard. \nShe walks well on leash and does appreciate some attention and affection but she is still very very fearful of new experiences of any kind. \nRosie will need time to adjust to other medium to large dogs in her new home but should not be around any small dogs, under any circumstances nor should she ever be allowed around small children!!!!! If you feel like you could be able to provide the perfect home for this tortured soul and help her to move on with her life and truly begin anew and experience all the love and compassion a family member deserves, please send an email to \nMutts2majestyrescue.apps@gmail.com requesting an application!

            "description": "This sweet boy was returned to BDC when his family was deployed overseas. \n\nAll About Blake\n\nBlake is used to being inside with his people and is kenneled when home alone. He enjoys playing and sunbathing in a fenced backyard frequently throughout the day. \n\nHe must be kept on a leash or in a fenced yard when outside because he is easily distracted and will run off. However, he would love to be on a property with lots of land to run if there were no close roads or neighborhood dogs/kids.\nBlake loves his daily walks (usually twice a day), especially right after his breakfast and dinner. He will eat breakfast between 6-8am and dinner as early as 4pm.\n\nHouse Manners\nBlake is fully house-trained and will paw at the door to indicate that he needs to \"\"get busy\"\" or wants to go outside. \nHe is used to being allowed on the living room furniture.\nHe will bark when anyone comes to the door or approaches the house. When guests visit, he is initially very excited and needs to be on a leash so that he knows not to jump on people...eventually he will settle down.\nBlake still has some \"\"puppy\"\" in him and will sometimes steal things off counters, tables, and furniture like laundry, paper, kids toys, and anything within reach that might be fun to play with. If he isn't napping or lounging and is left unoccupied in a room he will most likely try to be sneaky and get into some trouble (he always finds the trashcans!). \n\t\nObedience/Commands\nBlake went through basic obedience training at River Ridge Kennels in Richlands in October 2018. He knows basic commands. He still needs to work on his heel when walking and not jumping on people when he is excited. \n\nBasic commands:\n-Sit: hold pointer finger up and say \"\"sit\"\"\n-Down: use hand in front of his nose to guide him down and say \"\"down\"\" \n-\"\"Off\"\"/\"\"no jump\"\"\n-\"\"leave it\"\": anything you want him to leave alone, like laundry, squirrels, \tother dogs, etc.\n\t\nLikes\n-walks and runs on a leash\n-the beach\n-short car rides\n-playing fetch inside\n-being brushed\n-morning bellyrubs (or any time of day)\n\nDislikes\n-having his nails trimmed (only the groomer has been able to do this for him)\n\nSocial behavior \n-with people: Generally Blake is friendly and gets excited to meet people (either at home or on walks). \n-with dogs: Aside from not liking small dogs, Blake is unpredictable in whether he will like a dog his size or larger. He gets along well with labs and \"\"carefree\"\" dogs. As long as the other dog doesn't show dominance or aggression, Blake is usually friendly.\n\nOverall, Blake is a loyal dog who loves his people. He would do well in a home with a large backyard and an active family (perhaps with teenagers or older).",

Sadly Maise's mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and is now under hospice care. Her only wish was to make sure her little Maise had a safe place to land and wouldn't find herself homeless or in the shelter. Our rescue pups always have a spot in our rescue so Maise returned to her original foster from 3 years ago. \n\nMaise is a sweet girl with a heart of gold. She's good with other dogs, loved her adoptive moms grandkids and is an easy going girl and house trained. She'd make a wonderful addition to just about any home. If you'd like to give Maise another amazing family please apply today. If you are interested in adopting a Marley's Mutts please fill out an application at http://marleysmutts.org/adoptionprocess/",

We recommend that she be the only dog in the home with no small animals. She has shown aggression toward other dogs at the animal shelter, and her very high prey drive means that she would likely pose a danger to cats and other small animals. She is very playful and will need a home with a large yard. Shady is spayed and up-to-date on vaccinations. Shady's adoption fee has been fully sponsored. She is FREE with an approved adoption application. To adopt Shady, please complete an adoption questionnaire here: https://www.adamscountyanimals.org/adoptionsIf you would be interested in giving me a furever home, please contact The Humane Society of Adams County, Inc. at (937) 544-8585 to set up a time to come meet me and fill out an adoption application!",

Brent was in a pound and boarded for several months and is still learning how to \"dog\" in a home. He is crate-trained and house-trained and loves stopping to watch squirrels and birds on walks. He is unaware of what a big dude he is and often bumps into things, so a home rather than an apartment would be best for Brent. He loves having doggy buddies to chase and play with once they warm up to him. He can play a little rough so would need a dog that matches his play style if his forever home has another dog. He would do well in a home with other dogs and older children. Brent would prefer a fenced yard to sniff around in but would also be fine with active play and walks.\n\nGive in to his sweet brown eyes and adopt this handsome boy! Brent's adoption fee is $300.",

            "description": "Amelia is a sweet, 10- year-old female Chihuahua. In her early life, Amelia was mistreated, but she has been able to heal and enjoy her life now. She loves to relax and be held, and likes to try to take charge of everyone in her foster home, earning the nickname of \" little boss\". Like Annabella, she loves all people, gets along with children, enjoys the company of other dogs, and ignores the cat. Unlike Annabella, Amelia does not like to go for walks. In fact, she will refuse to move. All of Amelia's teeth are missing on one side of her mouth, which results in her cute tongue-out appearance. Amelia has been pad trained, and she does well with it most of the time.\n\nAmelia and Annabella are a bonded pair so must be adopted together. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Amelia and Annabella together is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Annabella is a lively, 10-year old Chihuahua/Rat errier mix with a sweet disposition. She is very attentive and extremely loyal to her family, and she does well with all people, including children. In fact, she considers it her job to be sure no lap is ever empty. She shows no aggression and is great with other dogs and ignores cats. She loves to play with her stuffed toys, especially her loofah dog. With her loud bark, Annabella gives warning of anything unusual going on outside; however, she has lived in an apartment with no complaints. She is learning about crate training, but whines at first unless she can see her people. Annabella is pad trained, but is learning to go outside to potty. She loves being outside enjoying the fresh air and going for walks.\n\nAnnabella and Amelia are a bonded pair and must be adopted together.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Annabella and Amelia together is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Harriett is a middle-aged couch potato who's affectionate to the humans she loves, and doesn't ask for much from them - except treats. She's a food motivated girl who's been especially fond of her foster caregivers and her APA! friends. She may be a lazy girl, but she's already learned to obey 'sit,' 'down' and 'roll over.' She walks well on her leash, often stopping and smelling what she sees. This funny, stubborn lady would love a low-traffic home with one or two people who are there most of the time or who work from home. She needs some help overcoming some separation anxiety, and can use ongoing assistance with her crate training and weight loss. She hasn't interacted much with other dogs in her playgroups, but might do well with a doggy housemate. Come meet her, her snorting will grab your heart!",

            "description": "Roscoe is such an incredible guy. Once he has decided that you are his human, he'll be your most devoted and loyal boy. He knows this is a scary world, and he'll trust you to keep him safe. He'll become your love bunny, sitting with his head on your lap while you watch TV and hoping for pets and grooming for his soft, shiny coat. Now in foster, this boy spins in circles and wags his tail with excitement when it's time to go for walks, or play those games of fetch that he loves. He's already a skillful dude who understands 'sit,' 'down' and 'place.' And he understands that 'off' means to take his Kong toys, Nyla bones and ropes off the couch and bed. Roscoe walks well on his leash and usually is good when seeing other dogs. However, he has a 'stranger danger' problem. He is fearful of other people he sees and needs continued training to help him understand that strangers are okay. His training is beginning to help resolve this, and should continue. At home, he's becoming a couch potato who's happy to dream the afternoon away while his people work, just coming up to put his head on their laps for some loving. He's also a house-trained boy who will hop in his crate to snooze. And he's excellent when left home alone, happy to stay in his crate or roam freely. This sweet boy hopes for a big home with a huge yard and adults who can play fetch with him, take him on long walks - and continue his training to help him continue becoming confident and secure with all people he meets. See more of him on Instagram at @alenavictoriab.",

In fact, the humans now think I could even have a friendly female sibling in the right home. Hurray!

This disease caused his skin to flake.  He needs baths in medicated shampoo a couple times a week in order to keep it under control.  But here is the great stuff about Jimmy!  He is one of the most well behaved and sweet dogs you could ever meet.  He is an American Bulldog born on 5/13/18.  He is wonderful with other dogs and likes to play, but is mostly very chilled out.  He enjoys a  good game of tug, but then also enjoys chilling on the couch.  He is crate trained, leash trained, and housetrained.  He is fantastic with kids.  However, the family who adopted him has a 3 year old who is irrationally fearful of Jimmy.  They have worked with a couple trainers who have both said Jimmy is perfect!  The child is terribly afraid though to the point that the 2 just can't coexist.  Can you give this wonderful boy a chance?  His skin condition is holding him back from being taken back in by the organization who adopted him out.  He just needs a family who is willing to help him out with his disease and give him a great new forever home.",

She has a calmer more easygoing demeanor, and loves attention and petting.  Walking on leash, Taryn ambles alongside you appreciating the sunrise and butterflies, not caring much about meeting other canines. She does best around  dogs who match her energy level; those silly, energetic pups can motorize the other way. Off-leash in playgroups, she takes time to familiarize herself in new settings, but opens up when with people. (She's a no for cats.) Taryn is more into people than pups, she will absolutely prize your affection and devotion and, in turn, will provide you with lifelong companionship. \n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Allie is a bit hard of hearing but once she gets you in her sights she will be your shadow, unless you walk by a comfy dog bed, then she\u2019s down for a nap! Allie has some much needed dental work that is going to be handled December 29th. Because of her dental it has taken a couple days to find the food she is comfy eating. She has not had any accidents in the house, take her outside to powder her nose and she does her business and ready to come back inside.

She won't leave your side once you show her affection. Sadie's energy level is low-medium and she'd rather be hanging by your side than playing fetch. She absolutely loves new people, so make sure your guests are prepared for big dog love and attention! Sadie is good with kids ages 5 years and older, but not recommended for toddlers. She is also leash trained and does well with other dogs.\nSadie and her slightly older Rottweiler mix bother Ruger are greatly loved, but need a new home(s) as they currently live with 3 kids under the age of 2 years and aren't able to be given the time and attention they need. They can be split up, but have lived together their whole lives and of course would love to stay together if possible. They are currently located in Eastvale (Corona), CA.\nPlease contact Joanna at jmorfa22@gmail.com or 714-336-4293 to meet Sadie today!",

It takes Cowboy a little time to warm up to new people but once he knows you, he gives the sweetest little kisses and cuddles. He loves getting out and running in the yard and then waiting for some belly rubs when yard time is over. He loves his toys and is neat and tidy in his kennel.

SRT rescued me from a shelter when my owners didn't want me back. \u00a0When SRT picked me up, they recognized immediately that I had some neurological issues. They took me straight to a specialty neurologist and I've been diagnosed with some pain in my cervical spine and also I have something called hydrocephalus or commonly known as water on the brain. This condition is more common in toy breed dogs. My doctor thinks with medication I can lead a good quality of life. I have some medications I will need to be on for life. I'm house and crate trained and love to play with my toys. I tend to stockpile them up. I'm fine with other dogs, but I would be happy to be your one and only. I love going on car rides and my foster mom takes me all the time. I can't jump up on furniture, but a comfy dog bed is just fine for me. I sleep quietly in my crate at night. I'm a special needs boy and need an all adult home. Click the Adopt tab, complete your application, and put me, Pop-Pop, as a pup of interest. My \u00a0adoption fee is $300\n.\nPlease visit our website at www.schnauzerrescuetexas.me to adopt or to see our other minis",

If you are looking for the quintessential active, affectionate guy, look no farther, Scooby is 72 Lbs and 1.5 years old. He has a great personality like a young Lab, Shepski type. He's very attentive, eager to please, is always smiling, happy, playful, friendly, loyal, affectionate and just an awesome all around dog companion. Scooby has the most adorable facial expressions and soulful eyes. He is a young pup in a large sized body, he's enthusiastic, great with all people and loves to give and get affection from everyone. He played with a Beagle puppy the other day and likes my neighbors Yorkshire Terrie. He may not realize his size yet and could use a little more training but he's pretty darn great. Plus he's housetrained, good in the car and loves a good game of fetch. What's not to love! Scooby is all about the love. He wants to bring joy happiness to his humans. With an active lifestyle, Scooby is medium energy in the home. If you are lucky enough to adopt Scooby, count yourself blessed. Please do not email or message us about Scooby, instead fill out an application. Thank you, https://www.welcomehomesanctuary.org/",

            "description": "Due to COVID concerns, only Texas applicants will be considered.\n\nInitial Bio 12/17/20: Teddy B is approximately 7 years old and about 10 pounds. He recently came to us from the Valley where he was found as a stray, then adopted, but ultimately returned to the shelter after some medical issues. Our sweet Teddy B has cardio megaly, which is an enlarged heart. He's being treated for some fluid due to total neglect. He has a cough, but we suspect that to dissipate. His bloodwork is absolutely perfect, so the vets feel this maybe congenital and he will have many years to give his owner. \n\nWe also feel this baby was a breeder due to his love of the crate. He is the sweetest boy and likely had a home once upon a time. As I said, Teddy knows exactly what a crate is and that he is to eat in there, his choice. He will curl up next to us on the couch, but if we get up or leave the room we almost always come back to find him in his crate- his safe space- with his blanket. We initially tried to let him sleep in bed with us, but after finding him cowering in the corner by the door, we quickly realized that for now he's most comfortable in his crate and thats' okay.\n\n A potential adopter will need to have a crate and be comfortable with using it until he feels comfortable without it. I've never heard him bark and he startles when making sudden movements. He wants to be your shadow and stay close for snuggles. He doesn't steal food from the other dogs bowls even when its left out and knows not to beg for food while we are eating- even when my 1 year old drops it on the floor for the dogs lol. \n\nRight now he is wearing a belly band, which he is using likely out of fear or anxiety and because of his meds for his heart. Teddy can at times be a very nervous boy, which makes us sad to think of what environment he's previously experienced, but we know that he deserves the very best forever home which can help him through all the normalcies of a loving life. He would likely benefit from a home in which someone is around most of the day. Feel free to email us for questions at uyrfoster23@gmail.com.",

He can learn any trick quickly and loves to play fetch, tug-o-war, or any other physical activity with his medium to high energy level. He likes new people and has no problem with kids ages 5 years or older, but he doesn't have the patience for toddlers as he once did. Ruger is leash and off-leash trained, with no problem heeling at every stop. He was crate trained as a younger dog, but hasn't used a crate in about 4 years. Ruger is good with other dogs, but can have a dominant demeanor.\nRuger and his Rottweiler-Bullmastiff sister Sadie are greatly loved, but need a new home(s) as they currently live with 3 kids under the age of 2 years and aren't able to be given the time and attention they need. They can be split up, but have lived together their whole lives and of course would love to stay together if possible. They are currently located in Eastvale (Corona), CA.\nPlease contact Joanna at jmorfa22@gmail.com or 714-336-4293 to meet Ruger today!",

While he was gone she had a Hollywood rendezvous with the lady\u2019s shitzu and it sparked her final project- THE BULLSHITS (pit bull terrier and shitzu mixes)! Yet, despite what we were told from the previous owner these babies have continued growing and growing, and they are a WHOPPING 8-10 pounds at only 7 weeks old.\nWe are guessing there was truly some Great Pyrenees in the mix. These adorable, long haired babies are beautiful and will be big teddy bears. Carmen Miranda is up to date, fully dewormed and microchipped. She is ready for her forever home! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "Meet the adorable Bodie!\n\nBodie arrived to the Humane Society as a transfer from ACCT Philly back in July of 2020. This handsome young man is around 5 years old and is UTD on vaccines, microchipped and neutered. \n\nSince arriving from the very busy and overcrowded shelter, we have learned a lot about this red meatball. Bodie is a very calm boy in his kennel, where you can always find him snuggled up in a pile of blankets with his favorite toy. Bodie love his favorite toys so much that you can always find them in his mouth! You guessed it, the way to this guys heart is through a ball!\n\nStaff and volunteers at our shelter have deemed Bodie a \"Staff Favorite\" and he has really shown everyone how loving he is. Bodie loves his friends so much that he would love nothing more than to sit on your lap with a toy in his mouth and receive all the attention! Because he loves attention so much, Bodie would do best as an only pet. You read that right, Bodie is not a socialite by any means and prefers his people all to himself so no other pets in the home for this guy!\n\nBodie, like all dogs, could continue to use work on his quirks. You see, Bodie gets so excited some times that he just can't control his mouth. He is a nippy lad, who will need a strong, breed experienced owner willing to work on his quirk to allow him to be the very best boy he can be. In transparency, it is our duty to inform all potential adopters of this quirk as some may perceive it as aggression. Bodie is not aggressive, but due to his quirks and need for continued training, he will require his forever family to have no children.\n\nBodie is currently NOT available for adoption, however is looking for a LOCAL FOSTER home that is willing to allow him to crash with them while we straighten out some medical concerns that we have noticed over the last month or so. He is currently on medication and under the care of an Internal Medicine Specialist. If interested in fostering Bodie, please reach out to the shelter for additional information. Best ways to contact are through our email at info@lebanonhumane.org or contact one of our Kennel Staff members, Alexa at 717-271-9115.",

She is a 10+ year Chinese Crested pup under 25lbs. \n\nShe's not exciting, but once she gets used to you (and vice versa) she's quite nice. Even though she's blinded by cataracts (like looking through a foggy window) she knows where her bed is, knows where the water bowl is, knows that the other dogs in her foster home go out the back door and stands there waiting to go out when she needs to potty. She has to be carried to grass and accompanied the whole time, but she's prompt and waits patiently to be picked up when finished. She has a typical old lady appetite, just a little warm water on kibble, thanks.\n\nShe still needs a dental and needs checked for a spay prior to being adopted. She will need lifetime drops to her eyes to try to keep her cataracts from becoming painful and Apoquel or some other maintenance treatment for itching. Otherwise, she'll be happy to keep a dog bed and blankets warm all day and night.\n\nIf you have a place in your heart (and your home) for China, apply at rescuedohio.org. China's adoption fee is $195.",

Bandit is around 2 years old.  Due to the pandemic the shelter is currently adopting dogs to Athens Co. residents only.\n\nIf you have other dogs and/or children at home you must bring them in for a meet and greet to see if they are compatible. \n\nSupport the Athens County Dog Shelter by walking your dog or yourself!  It won't cost you a cent!  Download the app \"Walk For a Dog\" from http://wooftrax.com to your phone and select Athens County Dog Shelter and then take a walk!  It's great for you and your pooches plus it benefits the homeless dogs at the shelter.  Use the app each time you grab the leash.  You, your dog and the shelter will all benefit.\n\nPlease visit  http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/U0RLUOCMT7KI \nto see the wishlist of items that the Shelter is in need of.  Thank You!",

She was terrified but we were contacted and pulled her into our rescue. Nothing but the good life from here on out baby!!\n\nOur wants for her:\n\u2022\tAdopted out into the southern states ONLY because she needs warm weather to walk to get this weight off her\n\u2022\tFenced in yard\n\u2022\tAnother small dog for her to pal around with NO big dogs\n\u2022\tNo apartments or high rises\n\u2022\tNo men or kids she\u2019s scared of them!\n\nI'm very sweet! I know because my foster Mommy says so all the time. I'm looking for somebody who will love me for forever and work on a little problem I have. I'm a bit chunky! I need someone who will take me on walks and be patient with me. I get tired and need to stop for a second or two and then continue my walk. I really do enjoy getting out. I've already started losing weight. My foster Mommy is very good at watching my diet and she got me this bright red sweater that is so toasty when we\ngo walking. She explained to me that it is very important I continue to lose weight. We dachshunds have a problem called IVDD (invertebrate disc disease), if we get too heavy our backs go out and we than can become paralyzed in the back. It can cost over $14-16K for the surgery! So I need someone to love me lots and take me for walks and watch my diet. \nI love my belly rubbed and I love all my babies (stuffed animals) . At night I am all about being tucked in and I sleep all through the night in my \ncomfy bed .Mommy calls me a snuggler! I also love bubble baths, I had one the other night and the hair dryer doesn't bother me either. I get along with other small dogs but I'm true dachshund and don't like big dogs at all. And in my mind I'm a big time squirrel hunter !! \n\nWell, if I sound like the perfect dog for you please fill out an application.\n \n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast and Mid-West. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

            "description": "Meet Leela, a large 5yr old Shepherd/Malinois mix! She loves people and is well trained. She knows sit, wait/stay, kennel, come, down, and even shake. The only thing Leela loves more than people is getting belly rubs, and lots of them! She is fully house trained with no accidents and kennel trained where she likes to calmly wait for her people to come home from work/school. She is still getting used to walking on a leash and needs to learn manners when meeting other dogs (she can be reactive/aggressive). She is calm and polite indoors and never begs or counter surfs. She adores being out and about on walks & could walk for hours if you wanted; but she likes being inside playing and getting pets from people too. She is calm around noises and new situations and in true shepherd fashion needs plenty of mental and physical activity to be healthy and happy. \n\nHer ideal home would have a fenced yard (wood or PVC), adults with kids over 8yrs old (if any) who love giving lots of pets and belly rubs & someone with Shepherd experience to handle the leash reactions.\n\nAdoption Fee: $350 (cash/card only) \n\nPlease contact our Dog Coordinator to learn more about Leela & to be put in touch with her foster Mom:\n\nJaime 651-324-1105 or Jaime3369@gmail.com\n\nDue to the recommendations about the coronavirus, we are not able to have group adoption events at PetSmart.  We are, however, allowed to do individual adoptions so if you are interested in this pup/dog, please contact the foster listed above to set up a meeting.  We look forward to continuing to save dogs with you and will resume group adoptions as soon as we can.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home & truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption; discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, & 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11am - 3pm at Lakeville PetSmart (located by Hy-Vee just off 160th & Pilot Knob) & Burnsville Petsmart (located just off Hwy 35E & County Rd 42 by Chianti Grill).\n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies temporarily into your home and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If you\u2019re interested, please email our dog coordinator: jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you! You can also apply to be a foster home on our webpage! In the upper left hand corner there\u2019s a drop down tab with the link for canine foster home. Just fill it out online & submit! We will get back to you as quick as we can.",

She was terrified but we were contacted and pulled her into our rescue. Nothing but the good life from here on out baby!!\nOur wants for her:\n\u2022\tAdopted out into the southern states ONLY because she needs warm weather to walk to get this weight off her\n\u2022\tFenced in yard\n\u2022\tAnother small dog for her to pal around with NO big dogs\n\u2022\tNo apartments or high rises\n\u2022\tNo men or kids she\u2019s scared of them!\nI'm very sweet! I know because my foster Mommy says so all the time. I'm looking for somebody who will love me for forever and work on a little problem I have. I'm a bit chunky! I need someone who will take me on walks and be patient with me. I get tired and need to stop for a second or two and then continue my walk. I really do enjoy getting out. I've already started losing weight. My foster Mommy is very good at watching my diet and she got me this bright red sweater that is so toasty when we\ngo walking. She explained to me that it is very important I continue to lose weight. We dachshunds have a problem called IVDD (invertebrate disc disease), if we get too heavy our backs go out and we than can become paralyzed in the back. It can cost over $14-16K for the surgery! So I need someone to love me lots and take me for walks and watch my diet. I love my belly rubbed and I love all my babies (stuffed animals) . At night I am all about being tucked in and I sleep all through the night in my \ncomfy bed .Mommy calls me a snuggler! I also love bubble baths, I had one the other night and the hair dryer doesn't bother me either. I get along with other small dogs but I'm true dachshund and don't like big dogs at all. And in my mind I'm a big time squirrel hunter !! Well, if I sound like the perfect dog for you please fill out an application.\n \n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast and MidWest. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

Boston was found as a lost boy on 12/11, and now he is looking for a loving family to call his own! Boston is a super sweet boy with a heart of gold and a love for treats. He is calm, easy going, and takes treats gently from hands. Boston will be a great family dog for any family looking for not only an affectionate cuddle bug, but also an adventurous boy that will love to go hiking and traveling with the family! Get to know and love this loving, 50 pound boy in run 801. His ID number is 626431. Boston is up-to-date on vaccines, now neutered, and will be microchipped, and heartworm tested upon adoption. He can't wait to start loving his new family!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

He came to his foster mom when he was found tied up outside a Petsmart in the middle of winter with a broken leg. Dexter is very affectionate and loves to go for walks. He is docile, but he also has a little grouchy side too. He loves burying himself in his blankets and making a nest. Dexter has a screw in one of his front legs from when it was broken. He has a unique appearance and can be a little silly looking, with patchy fur. His foster mom took him to several vets to determine the cause. It was decided that since he is a blue tricolor chi, sometimes alopecia is genetically common in these dogs, so his fur is just a bit threadbare. Dexter has been around LOTS of other small dogs and does great with them. He is also good with cats. He is house trained and potty pad trained. He would do well with adults or older, gentle children/teens in a calmer home. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!",

I was seen being abandoned in the middle of nowhere but the person that left drove away so fast those that saw it happen couldn't catch them. Instead, they contacted the local pound and ask that I be taken so no more hard cold come to me. My body shows the hardship of an old unloved dog, i'm not neutered and I have masses on my chest and legs that have not been examined by a doctor, and I hurt everywhere. I won't flinch at the dogs that growl at me as I walk past thier kennel. I won't take for granted the kindness of a human. The folks at this shelter and those at Always & Furever Midwest Animal Sanctuary are taking me to a vet right now to receive medical attention. I'm not young, I'm not healthy, but I'm here, and I matter.",

He was used to breed, arrived frightened and completely unsocialized and after 2 weeks of leaving him alone, he began to learn to trust and has become a loving little guy although still fearful,  We adopted him to a single human home and he regressed.  Baby runs and plays and does happy dances and wags his tail but still tends to keep to himself when approached and is currently happiest with a pack of dogs and being left to his own devices.  He seems to thrive on activity and commotion of the dogs and his runs with his pack. He will still take going slowly and no false moves until he settles in with someone when it comes to the one on one with humans. He will not work with children because of that. He should have an experienced and tolerant owner who will always respect him and care deeply for what he has been through during his formative years.  He will be an expensive dog to maintain, needing to be groomed frequently; his breed is considered high maintenance and unless regularly groomed will end up a mess like he was when we got him (his hair is VERY long)..  He also needed a dental at the young age of approx 3 so be prepared to be able to afford frequent dental needs going forward.  He is approximately 3 years old and we are asking an adoption donation of 345.00 and an application.  And a home that matches what is written above.  Dogs important and an active lifestyle with a fenced yard and space to run and play.",

I'm fairly new to Hi Tor, but I so badly want to find my forever home! \n\nI'm known as the adorable dog with the wiggle butt! Anytime I see humans, I think they're all there to see me, so I get so excited! I love saying hi to everyone and getting pets. I also love belly rubs and tennis balls! However, I don't like other animals, so would need to be the only pet. I can go home with kids though since I love humans so much. I also walk very nicely on a leash and appear to be potty trained. \n\nWould you consider letting me be part of your family? I promise to love you forever and be forever grateful. If you'd like some more information or you would like to come meet me, you can email dogs@hitor.org. \n\nHope to see you soon!",

            "description": "Natasha is a pretty girl with two distinct sides to her. On the one hand, she can be demure, sensitive and unsure in new situations, and takes some time to warm up. But once she starts feeling more comfortable, she reveals the firecracker within! Natasha may be on the petite side, but she is strong and determined on walks. This girl certainly seems food-motivated, and treats seem to be one way to fast-track into her heart! During quiet moments where she can relax, Natasha shows her sweet and affectionate side by trying to clamber in your lap for attention. She is somewhat anxious around other dogs so far and would likely need slow, gradual intros. She would likely do well in a calmer home where she can adjust at her own pace and blossom! Natasha is estimated to be around 3 years old and weighs 43 lbs.\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

She is a friendly, funny, \"life of the party\" kinda girl who will win your heart with the twinkle in her big brown eyes!  She is a medium energy girl with good leash manners and she's currently learning basic commands in her foster home.  She likes other dogs, likes to be busy, and likes to be a bit bossy with her canine friends.  She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  Wendy is HW+ and is currently available for a foster to adopt situation until her HW treatment is complete and she is medically cleared for adoption. If you are not familiar with Heartworm disease, dogs get it from mosquitos and it is not contagious. It is highly treatable, but requires extended rest during treatment.\n\nFor more information about Wendy Lou, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Diesel. I'm tall, dark, and you guessed ithandsome! Everyone here loves spending time with me and has learned a lot about my personality. I didn't have the best start to life; new strangers (especially men) can make me uncomfortable. I like to keep my friend circle small and cozy. Because new people can make me nervous, I am looking for a new family who really gets dog behavior. If I could describe my ideal home, it would have: a cozy, comfy bed, a pantry full of doggy snacks, great toys for chasing, a loving family, and a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. A fenced yard would be nice too, so I can run all over and act like a goof. Did you notice kids aren't part of my dream home? Yeahthey aren't very quiet, and I prefer the sophisticated company of adults, thank you very much! But I would maybe like a dog sister! No brothers pleasemale dogs always get in my space and I don't like that. Also, no small animals or cats for me! I love to keep busy chewing on a good snack or Kong, but I like to be alone when I enjoy a delicious snack; I mean, do you like it when people take your snacks away? I don't think so! Overall, I am a simply fella; I like to know my routine, what I'm doing everyday, but I need someone to spend my days with! I've been at the shelter for a long time, and I dream of my new family arriving to take me home. I know they are somewhere out there, I just have to be patient! I have a lot of hopes and wishes for my new family, so it might take a few meet and greets for me to find the perfect fit! Please give me a chance if you think we could be a match. If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering - Leash and collar Adoption fee: $135.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older.",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullABOUT DUKE\n\nDuke is a fun-loving boy who is still an energetic puppy! He has a high energy level and would love a family that would help him channel that energy into hikes, car rides and playing fetch! He is friendly with other dogs but, since he is still a youngster, he sometimes forgets how strong he is. He would do best with a family that is familiar with pitbulls and would help him become more socialized. He loves food and will do anything for a treat! If his people are otherwise occupied, Duke will entertain himself by throwing his toys, and especially tennis balls, for himself - who needs humans?! He loves to play fetch and explore, but NOTHING beats a good belly rub! Have to run errands? Duke is a great co-pilot! He lies down in the back seat and enjoys the ride! Duke sleeps in his crate at night and is generally a quiet boy. He loves people and may get a little too excited and jump on new people, but he can't help it - he loves everyone!\n\nDuke would enjoy a family who is pitbull-savvy. He would love to have another dog to play with, but one who will help him learn \"how to dog\" more, especially socially. He'd do well with active older kids, but is likely to be too jumpy/strong for younger kids. He'd love to be part of your adventures- hikes, car trips - but can also be part of a family where he is alone some of the day since he does very well in his crate.\n\nDuke just wants to be loved - don't you want to love him?\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and fed premium grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

She needs time to acclimate to people, to get to know you a bit before warming up.  Once she gets to know you, she\u2019s very lovable, friendly and sweet (and gives kisses!). She keeps a clean cage, which is a good indication that she\u2019s housetrained, but not a guarantee.  We aren\u2019t sure how she is with other dogs at this point, because we haven\u2019t had anyone to try her with. We do think, though, that she\u2019d be okay with other dogs, as long as those dogs aren\u2019t \u201cpushy\u201d.  We aren\u2019t sure how she is with cats.  Sugar needs a home without small children. \n\nInterested in adopting?  Find our adoption application and more at our website: www.mchsofmn.org\n\nADOPTION FEE at the shelter $180.00 (Cash or Check Only - Includes sales tax)\nPotential adopters are required to fill out an adoption application.

He is a sweet, low key, affectionate boy who was abandoned at a church and has a large scar on his back, but is not bothered by it at all.  He has a ginormous head to match his big body and his even bigger heart!  Brody likes female dogs, but may be selective with males so slow introductions to other male dogs would be needed.  He's learning basic commands in his foster home and his leash manners are a work in progress (his foster mom says he pulls a lot and gets excited to see squirrels & cars, but he responds to corrections).  He's a medium energy boy looking for an adult only home with possibly a female dog companion and a family committed to working on his training and helping him live his best life.  Brody is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  \n\nFor more information about Brody, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

Of course Marley defended himself and he was not always very successful at it.  Thankfully he is with us now and he is looking for his perfect home. Marley loves to play with squeaky toys and play fetch...he is very much a puppy at heart he is so playful. Also, he is housetrained but will need to be leash trained. We do not know how Marley is with cats and we want a home with NO KIDS since Marley is still a bit nervous from his past experience.

She is housebroken and does well with other dogs unless their is food around. She will guard her food so feeding her separately from other animals will prevent this from being an issue.  She loves to play and is very affectionate.  She needs a no cat home.  \n\nIris is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

            "description": "Oakley is a super special dog that needs a super special home! He\u2019s a pit/mastiff mix at around 65 pounds and 4 years old. \nWe don't know much about his history, other than he was a stray picked up and brought to a Caddo parish animal shelter.  He was completely shut down and emaciated at the shelter and was scheduled to be euthanized when he was pulled by Take Paws. He\u2019s a beautiful, calm, gentle boy who deserves to finally know happiness.\nFor the past month Oakley has been living with a professional dog trainer where he has been given the opportunity to decompress, build confidence, and learn to trust. Oakley was initially extremely despondent and depressed, but has started coming out of his shell over the last few weeks more and more. He needs humans who will be patient with him and who will continue to help him progress in a calm, quiet house with little to no commotion. \nHe\u2019ll do best around low energy, balanced dogs who can show him that life isn\u2019t always so scary. \nOakley shows the most emotion when he goes on walks, where he walks perfectly by your side and does not pull in the slightest. He is not leash reactive, although he is scared of children. \nOakley deserves a loving forever home!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

I am nervous with new people and will likely needs several meet and greets with a potential adopter before going home.  I will need a home without children because of my nervous nature, I would like a quite home without the noise that the silly creatures bring.  I am not dog aggressive, but I will also need a home where I can be the only pet.  They tend to stress me out and cause me to vomit.  That being said, I am not really the scaredy cat that I sound like, I love attention from my people and being outside.  I am always ecstatic when I get to hang out in the office with the ladies!  I love stuffed toys with squeakers too!  Can I be your forever lap dog?\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Anyone who has been dragged around the neighborhood by a Husky will appreciate her gentleness on a leash. She is looking for a calm adult home or at least respectful older kids. Harleigh loves to play and she would be too much for small children or small dogs. Her adoption fee will be $350. She is fostered in Avon. Please be aware of the requirements for a Siberian Husky. They are twice as much work and twice as much fun as most dogs. Please call or text 317-435-8217 for more information or to meet her.",

Audrey is a one year old mix of Mountian Cur, Australian Shepard & Mini Pinscher who weighs around 50lbs. She\u2019s been an amazing mom to her 7 extra large pups but now it\u2019s her turn to find a family of her own! Audrey is a little on the shy side and will need someone who is patient to let her blossom into her true self. She has low to average energy and is very content with walks (and is good on a leash) & hanging out with some chin rubs. She enjoys her Kong, lickibowl & snuffle mat.  She is housebroken as well.  We recommend her with calmer kids who are 10+. \n\nShe\u2019s quite the escape artist, so a securely fenced in yard is a must for this girl! It\u2019s her turn to find a family who is willing to put in the patience, time and effort to help her become the best girl she can be!  Her white tipped tail hardly ever stops wagging to you are off to an amazing start with her enthusiasm and energy!\n \nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Audrey, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted.

I do not love other dogs or cats, so it would be best to walk me somewhere where I won't see other dogs. If you meet me at the shelter, I may be loud and bark a lot because I don't like those other dogs. But I promise I am so sweet when I'm not around them. \n\nI am a lovely medium energy level. I would love a backyard where I can run and play with you. I like to play and go for walks but I'm also really good at just snuggling up on a lap. I would do very well with someone who enjoys the outdoors as much as I do. You should see my cute hop when I run. I like to play with toys when I am hanging out inside the house. \n\nI am crate trained and house trained. I am very calm and loving around people I like to stand on my back legs and give hugs. Yes, hugs! I will wrap my arms around you and lay my head on your shoulder. I am goofy and affectionate, and I am looking for a fur-ever home. \n\nAsk about my discounted adoption fee and make an appointment to meet me today!\n (4 years old, 48 pounds, spayed, only pet, crate trained, house trained, kid friendly)",

Lucy is a sweet girl with a lot of love to give. She's all about a good snuggle and will lick your face and hands to show you how much she loves you. Lucy is great on a walk!

I don't understand why.\n\nI am a sweet girl. I am a bit timid when I first encounter new situtations but I warm up fairly quickly. I have lots of energy and love to run and play. I love attention from my humans. I ride very nicely in the car. More information will be posted on me as known. No cats. I would do best with a calm male but would need to be introduced to all dogs in the home.\n\nIf you are interested in me please review adoption criteria and area at www.doberescue-ne.org and if you qualify please place an application.All of our dogs are current with all shots, are on heart worm preventative monthly and are neutered/spayed. All dogs are tail docked. All of the above Dobes are pure breed Dobermans unless otherwise noted.We hope you can find a place in your heart and your home for one of our rescue Dobes.Please Note:In most cases we require a fenced yard.We do not place our rescue dogs in homes with very young children (under the age of 8 years). We set these limitations, not because of aggression issues with our dogs, but because Dobermans are generally large, active dogs and can easily knock down, run over or easily trip a small child, causing a serious fall. Also, we reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.Our adoption area encompasses Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota.Copyright 2007 - Omaha Doberman RescueFor more information or to fill out an adoption request please visithttp://www.doberescue-ne.org/",

We were told she would play with his german shep but we havent had any chance to really introduce her to other dogs that she has gotten along with so for that reason we ask she be the only dog. She has been alright around the kids but is very strong and will knock them over without much thought. she is very sweet and loving but also a spitfire that loves to play. She does need a little leash work because she does get very worked up and turns into a wild child. She is also a talker, some could think she is being mean when its just her making noise.The first step in adopting an animal is to fill out the application. For an application please see our website www.tanyasinc.org and download an application and e-mail it to us. All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, dewormed, and are treated with advantix for fleas and ticks. They are also micro chipped(transfer of registration to your name is $20.00). With every adoption you will also receive coupons from PETCO.The best way to get ahold of us is to e-mail Tanya at tanyasinc@msn.com",

I love cuddling and wet kisses. I would prefer no kitty friends in the home. My previous owner says I am crate and potty trained, but Pawmetto Lifeline doesn't have a house like they did - won't you give me a home for Christmas?\n \nMy adoption fee of $200 includes my up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, deworming, and I come home spayed/neutered. I even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? \n \nIf you're interested in adopting me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org. Feel free to check out more of my friends or more information on PawmettoLifeline.org. The Pawmetto Lifeline Adoptions Department is open to all approved applicants on a walk-in basis from Tuesdays through Saturdays from 12pm to 6pm. Our last meet and greet is at 5:30pm. We are closed on Sundays and Mondays. We can't wait for you to find your match! Could I be the one for you?",

She had a large tumor removed from her chest and has recovered from that surgery along with her spay.  Our vet thinks she's about 5-6 years old.  She been quite content since that uncomfortable tumor has been removed.  She also has another surgery to go through to remove a small tumor on her front leg.  Our vet wants her to go through her heartworm treatment before the second surgery.  She can be fostered through her heartworm treatment and second surgery.  All that is covered through donations.  \nShe is quite selective of other dogs.  She could do ok with another male but doesn't get along with other female dogs.  She has not been around any small children but would be ok with older teenagers.  She loves her meal time and can be quite demanding at feeding times....she will let you know when breakfast and dinner need to be served.  Not sure about cats...she doesn't seem to bother the ones in her foster home but they are separated with a baby gate. Think a retired person who is home a lot and needing a companion would be a great match for Butters.  \nHer adoption fee is $150 and her upcoming surgery and heartworm treatment is covered by Save1Pet.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

            "description": "PLAYFUL AND ENERGETIC:  10 months old / 41 lbs. \n\nHi there, my name is Branch!  I was adopted from Mostly Mutts when I was just a puppy, but my owner had a job change that requires a great deal of travel, leaving little time for me.  So, Mostly Mutts is helping me find a new home and family to love!  I\u2019m currently participating in the prison/foster training program, where I will be learning lots of great commands and doggie manners.\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  No dogs please.  I am a very rough player and get overly excited and assertive in play \u2013 I just don\u2019t know how to turn it off, so a home without other dogs is best for me.  I did accidentally bite a volunteer\u2019s leg once when passing by another dog\u2019s crate when we were both overly excited \u2013 I redirected to the volunteer \u2013 so sorry about that / Cats Unknown, but I don\u2019t think so / I haven\u2019t met kids yet at MM\u2019s or in my previous home, but since I am a busy player, much older kids such as teens will likely be best \u2013 let\u2019s meet and talk with my trainer. \n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a very playful guy with big puppy energy and I\u2019m affectionate, too.  I love being with people so much that I have separation anxiety and have started medication for it.  A dog savvy owner who is home a lot and wants to be active/exercising with their dog could be a good fit for me / My energy level is 7-9, so I am looking for an active family dedicated to my training and providing regular outlets for my energy.  I can see myself going for hikes, walks, maybe even some runs or camping.  The sky\u2019s the limit.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY: I am a student in the Mostly Mutts University prison/foster training program, where I am learning lots of great doggie commands with my trainer and having fun at the same time.  Leash manners are top of my training list as I currently pull on my leash / I do not like being in a crate at all \u2013 we are going to try a special crate for me soon, so just ask about that / Though reportedly potty trained, I\u2019ve had accidents since being at Mostly Mutts.  Perhaps I am just getting used to the schedule, so please be consistent with taking me out.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love to play with toys and be active with my people, so let\u2019s have some fun / I don\u2019t like being alone or in a crate at all, and I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I did not get regular exercise, training and the love I deserve!  \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered. I\u2019m on a medication for severe separation anxiety \u2013 my trainer will be glad to talk to you about this. \n\nI am looking for a dog savvy family that will be active with me and include me in on lots of fun as well as continue my training.  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

She is high energy and will need an active home.\nShe is about 1 1/2 years old, spayed, microchipped, current on all her vaccines.  Unfortunately, she has tested positive for heartworms and is about finished with her heartworm treatment.  \nShe enjoys a good run in the yard.  Sadly, she hasn't really recognized any toys yet.  She has not been destructive and that's always good.  She loves to get belly rubs.  She doing much better on her kennel training.  We feel like she probably spent her early life in small pen area.  She still circles a lot but is learning there is plenty of room to explore here in her foster home.\nShe does not do well with other female dogs but really likes the boys here in her foster home.  She doesn't seem to be fazed by the cats in her foster home.\nHer adoption fee is $150 and Save1Pet is covering her heartworm treatment.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

Trooper is a very curious, playful, and energetic young boy who loves chew toys like Nylabones. While he also enjoys stuffed toys, they never last very long because he likes to de-stuff them and try to snack on the pieces! Trooper is a type 1 diabetic and receives insulin shots twice daily after eating. Due to the importance of his insulin shots, his ideal forever family would work from home or have staggered schedules allowing a caregiver to always be present when he needs them. Trooper's foster family says that while his condition is manageable, it is lifelong. Having a diabetic dog requires regular veterinary checkups and purchasing medication, so Trooper must be adopted by a family who is ready, willing, and able to commit to managing his diabetes for the rest of his life. To learn about diabetes in dogs please go to\nDiabetes in Dogs: Symptoms, Treatment, Cost and Life Expectancy | PetMD T\nooper's biggest passion in life is food -- ANY food! Sometimes he will attempt to swipe snacks from the trash can or the kitchen table, which his foster mom reports is managed with consistent rules. Because of the diabetes, Trooper's diet needs to be monitored closely at all times. (He was hoping that we wouldn't share that last part with potential adopters.... ;) ) Trooper gets along well with other dogs. His foster mom reports that one of his favorite activities is playing with his canine foster sister! He also enjoys hanging out with his human foster siblings. While Trooper is not a cuddler, he is very sweet and affectionate and likes to lie next to his humans to get attention. He also loves going for walks with his people! He is currently learning to walk like a gentleman; he tends to pull on his leash to remain \"part of the pack\" if the other dogs he is walking with get ahead of him. Trooper knows basic obedience commands and is housebroken. He is crate trained, as well, although he will fuss a bit if he thinks it'll get him out of his crate! :) If you want to be Trooper's forever family, please submit an application today to adopt him!",

When I meet someone new or if I'm in a new situation, it may take me a few minutes to check everything out. I'm going to play keep away until I'm sure things are cool. With other dogs and people, I prefer women to men. When I do warm up, we are going to play. Hard. I am all play and no rules so training classes will be an important tool for me to learn my manners. I like to be the one who sets the pace. The staff at WSHS have found that I can be a little domineering with other dogs. This means I should be the only dog in the home. I can't help that I don't like to share the love! I am a good listener, and I know how to sit and down on command. I am eager to please once I know you. My new home must have a 6ft fence because my high jump would qualify for the Olympics. If you've been looking for a fun loving new family member, you've found him. Come and meet me today!\n\nPlease note - we always take our animals back if for some reason it doesn't work in your home so we only adopt to the following Illinois counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will.",

            "description": "Hello there, I'm Tony! I came to WSHS after being passed around from person to person, so now I'm looking for a stable forever home. Despite my rough start in life, I absolutely love people and want to be around them all the time. When people go away, I get anxious. I have separation anxiety, but we've been working on it here at the adoption center. I'm looking for a very special person or family to help me feel secure with a stable environment that has lots of routine and structure. Routine will help me anticipate what comes next so I don't get worked up about the unknown. Someone who can take me to work with them or a home where someone is always around would be a great match! Here at WSHS, I get to help out at the adoption desk by snoozing on a comfy bed by their work station. (It's very important work.) I need someone who wants a little shadow to follow them around all day.\n\nTraining classes will help me be the best version of me and help me gain confidence in my new home. My new home should have kids over 8 years old. Cats do not like how much I like them, so I can't live with cats. Playing with other dogs is one of my favorite things, but they sometimes don't like the way I play. If I'm to live with another dog, our play styles should be complimentary. Our initial meeting will include any dogs in your home so we can evaluate our compatibility. I can't live in apartments, townhomes or condos because of my barking. I'm a misunderstood little lover who is looking for his permanent forever home. Take a chance on me, you'll fall in love right away!\n\nPlease note - we always take our animals back if for some reason it doesn't work in your home so we only adopt to the following Illinois counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will.",

Chows are unbelievably adorable and are often adopted because of how cute they are without people truly understanding the breed. Griff's foster mom has put together an impressive list of criteria for his adoption to help us narrow down ALL the applications we are sure to receive for this ridiculously cute guy.\n\nGriff is approximately 2 years old, male, shaded black chow who weighs about 55lbs. He is looking for the following:\n\n1 - experienced chow owner. He needs someone who has worked with Chows and knows how to be a good pack leader.\n2 - a female dog sibling to play with or someone who can commit to taking him to a structured daycamp once or twice a week for socialization and play time.\n3 - someone who owns their home. Not all rental properties restrict Chows, but many do. For that reason, homeowners will be given precedence.\n4 - time and resources. Chows can be a tricky breed that require ongoing socialization with both humans and dogs. They need continued training, regular grooming and (especially for Griff, because of his history) a high quality diet.\n5 - older children (at least 8 years old) who have experience with dogs and are respectful and savvy.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Griff and seeing if he could be the perfect, handsome, fluffy guy to complete your family, apply to meet him today at rescuerovers.org",

            "description": "Meet Milo. Milo is a sweet 10 lb senior boy. He is an easy keeper and likes to hang out with his people and find a soft, warm place to nap on quiet afternoons. He has the most amazing, plushy brindle coat and an endearing, expressive little face. Milo sleeps quietly all night in his crate but loves to sleep on his person's bed too. He is housebroken when on a regular schedule and has existed peacefully with other dogs and cats. His superpowers include: napping, asking for petting (back and head scratches are just the best!), keeping a careful watch on the availability of any tasty tidbits, laying on the couch watching TV with his humans, and asking for attention with the cutest little voice. He is a good watchdog and will let you know when the delivery man is at the door. Milo is a special needs boy who came into rescue with a serious heart murmur. Due to his heart condition, Milo cannot go for long walks but gets excited to put on his harness and go for a walk around the block. He has responded well to treatment and is stable on his medication, which he needs for life. His medications cost approximately $60/mo and he requires regular check ups. This gentle boy is looking for his forever, retirement home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please fill out an application at https://www.hopeanimalshelter.net/petfinder.

I've got puppy energy to burn so I'm looking for an active home with lots of toys and lots to do.\nWhen I have a job to do, like find treats in a puzzle toy, or chew on a really great bone, I am calm and relaxed.\n\nWhen I get excited, I tend to get a bit jumpy and mouthy, so any kids in my new home would have to be 14 years or older. While I've been here at WSHS, I have been taking obedience and socialization classes so I can be the best me I can be. I walk nicely on a leash with an appropriate collar or harness and I've been learning how to heel. I've been learning how to tune out distractions and focus on what my person is telling me. I want to be the only pet in my new home, so I can't live with any other pets. I'm well on my way to being a great dog, I'm looking for the right home to help me finish my journey. If you're looking for a new furry friend for life, you've found him! Come and meet me today!\n\nPlease note - we always take our animals back if for some reason it doesn't work in your home so we only adopt to the following Illinois counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will.",

Not much is known about my past but my caretakers think there may be some trauma, because when people move too fast I cower. I am a young dog with lots of energy! I love people and want to be with them all the time, and I'll play with just about anything. Even leaves! I would love a home with people that have lots of time to spend with me. \n\nI was born around 12/10/2019. I am spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccinations. \n\nIf you're interested in adopting me please call 231-924-9230 or fill out an application on my shelter's website at\nwww.bellwetherharbor.org/adoptions/application-for-adoption/",

We currently have foster care for Clooney but we are hoping to find a senior sanctuary or a foster or adopter that will make his last days filled with love, comfort, and great treats.

Instead the human put Bumble in the home and just let it be with the other dog in the home. WIth the added stress there was an issue with who was alpha and they returned Bumble to the shelter. Bumble loves kids and does well with other dogs. He is an office favorite at the shelter but they felt it would be better he be in a foster home prior to adoption. So he came to us. He loves attention. He is not a fan of youngr children\n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets.

He has the cutest little white tip on his tail that catches in the sun as he wags it happily! Valentine's isn't very far away and maybe this boy will be the one to fill your heart with LOVE!\n\nNeed a co-pilot that doesn't \"bark\" directions?? Theo loves to ride along and just observe whats going on around him. He is excellent in the car so if you travel a lot; he'd be a great companion to keep you company on the road.\n\nTheo is young & active and so a family that likes outdoor fun, jogging, hiking and those kinds of things would be idle for Theo. He is agile and could see him learning cool tricks! He is gets excited when 1st on a walk, but he knows and understands loose leash walking. With continued positive reinforcement, he will be an awesome exercise companion. He knows SIT and is learning other commands to be a polite boy. \n\nWe are learning what kinds of other dogs Theo likes to play with right size, right energy level, and just the right fit.\n\nTheo is a one-year old, 55lb male that loves attention. Hes good with other dogs,and should be supervised to ensure proper introduction and energy levels. He is way too interested in kitties, so no cats in the home. Theo is young and active so needs a family and/or other dogs that are a good match for him...watch his zoomie video :)! Young kids seem to make him nervous, so he will only be considered for a home with the appropriate age of children.\n\nTheo is a very handsome boy and often turns heads. He is very photogenic and \"plays to the camera\" with his good looks and bright smile.\n\nAs part of Theo's $250 adoption fee, he is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and current on his monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. If you have questions about this sweet boy, you can email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Theo, you can fill in an online application for him under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org.",

We are guessing he is a 1 1/2 year old American Staffordshire Terrier/Australian Cattle Dog mix who loves other dogs and needs a doggy sibling, is good with older children, is crate trained and house trained and will cuddle with anyone who will let him! This boy thinks hes a 40 lb lap dog! He loves to play with toys, even by himself and loves to chase his foster doggie siblings around the yard. He has a lot of energy, but also loves to lay around and chew on his Benebone.\n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at www.rescuerowinc.org\n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex. We are dedicated to rescuing dogs in shelters, dogs in abusive or neglectful situations, and dogs surrendered by their owners because of difficult circumstances. We place dogs in loving, responsible, committed permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process, which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a dog into their homes and lives. Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, microchipped, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment, and placed in nurturing foster homes while they await placement in their permanent homes. We assist dogs in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. Dogs in the greatest need take priority. Finally, we strive to work with shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless dogs.",

My name is Zoya, and if I weren't so shy, I might actually say hello to more people. But people worry me, and I am learning to open up and trust them. I've never been mean to a human, in fact, I'd rather run from them than spend time with them... they always seem to want to grab me, touch me, or stare at me with their teeth shining at me... rather terrifying when I don't really know what all that means from a human, but in dog language it isn't very comforting. I like the people I have come to know, they feed me, pet me, talk calmly to me, and let me play with all these other dogs in the pack. I think I'd like my own family, but it would have to be a calmer household with a yard, and maybe I'd do better if I had another dog with me that could help me interpret what human behaviors really mean. I'm quiet, shy, generally polite, and with patience and time, I get to like my small world of people. I don't pee in the house, don't mind cats, and am not a very vocal dog. I'm nervous about the world when I go on walks, but I'm not rude or aggressive in any way. So, if you are a patient, quiet person, maybe with another dog in the home, perhaps we should meet. Don't expect too much of me at first, but eventually, as we get to know one another, I'm pretty sweet and loyal.",

            "description": "Jake is a 3 year old Staffordshire Terrier mix who, despite his young age, has been through the wringer. Jake was rescued from a high kill shelter in Texas and has been undergoing heartworm treatment ... and takin' it like a champ! Jake's a month shy of his final checkup and ready to find his furever fam. According to Jake's foster, \"he is a GREAT dog! He absolutely loves and adores our kids and he's amazing with them. He'll be a hard one to let go!\" This happy-go-lucky, playful young dog loves an active home (kids, please!), his basket of stuffy toys, other dogs, and fun games like tug and wrestle. Jake is a big, silly, lovebug that sometimes forgets his size; therefore, it might be best if all children in the home are over the age of 8. Jake is kennel trained and is proud to show you how he can \"sit\" and \"stay\". In his foster home he's working on learning additional commands including how to not bolt out the front door. Jake will need a home with a sturdy, large fence because this smart, strong boy can easily maneuver himself over a regular chain link. This southern boy is still adjusting to brutal winter weather so right now he is having the occassional accident but, by and large, Jake is house trained. This sweet, lovable boy is always ready for an adventure - backyard or road trip - as long as it's with you!\n\nBefore applying to adopt Jake, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Jake is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

I\u2019m a little slow to warm up to humans though because I wasn\u2019t around them when I was a baby. I love my foster mom lots though cause she\u2019s got the food! I'm looking for a home with some larger dog buddies and a fenced yard. Mom says these are non-negotiable whatever that means. I\u2019ll need a human who is patient because I\u2019m still learning everything and one who is very generous with the treats! If you have bigger dogs, a fence, patience and lots and lots of treats we might be made for each other!\n\nTo be considered the first step is to apply here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton \n\nWe are located in Joliet Illinois and require adopters be within a 100 mile radius to adopt.

As long as the pet is viewable, we are accepting applications. No matter the outcome, we will email all applicants once the pet has been adopted. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nHello! My name is Copper. I am an 11 month old 60lb lover boy! I am a Pit bull mix. I am hoping to find a furever home soon as I really just want to settle down. Sadly, my family could no longer keep me due to having another baby. \n\nI am good with other dogs and like to play and rough house. I was good with the kids in my previous home, however, my new family should keep in mind that I like to play nip sometimes. I am working on leash training as I am a pretty strong guy, but I learn quick. I am house trained. Crate training is a work in progress, I really do not like it. While I do like to play, really I am happy just hanging out on the couch.\n\nBeing rehomed was really hard on me. I really loved my family and I am having a hard time understanding why they are gone. Therefore, I can be standoffish with strangers, especially men. However, after about 30 mins or so, I start to warm up. It will be really important that my new family is one that is a bit more laid back. One that will give me the time I need to settle in, but does not have a super busy house hold. \n\nI am up to date on shots, neutered, microchipped, and on heartworm prevention.\n\nMy Adoption Fee is $200.00",

I am a 6 month old 30lb Pit Bull mix who is looking for a new home!.\n\nWith the typical energy of a 6 month old puppy, I love to play, chew bones, and I go crazy for the squeak toys! I am super treat/food motivated which is great for training! I know sit, come, and leave it! I love to play with other dogs, especially the other foster puppies--I need a friend in my new home! \n\nIn all reality, I have been through a lot in 6 months. I went to a home with a nice family but then they had another baby and it just became too much. From there I have been placed into foster care--and I did not know anyone there. I was super scared, but after a few days, I learned that they were nice and cared for me. So, when we first meet, I might be a little shy. However, give me time to settle and I will be your best friend. I am good with cats. I can live with kids, however, I can be shy at first. I will just need a family who understands I need some time. I am house trained and crate trained. \n\nI am up to date on shots, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm prevention.\n\nMy Adoption Fee is $300.00",

He has been living with a wonderful foster family on Coronado learning what LOVE is and learning that people are \u201cgood\u201d. Phyllo is looking for a forever home that can continue to show him kindness and a family that will have patience & grace with him as he learns his new surroundings. He\u2019s unsure of new people at first and not quick to trust. He\u2019s very comfortable around another dogs and we believe a family with an existing confident dog in the home would be best for him! If you\u2019re interested in adopting Phyllo please fill out an application at www.muttscouts.org\nSee below!*\n\n*Please kindly note: We do not respond to inquiries as we are a very small team!

He is very friendly and loves cuddles, but who doesn't?! Marshall also has tons of energy and likes to be wherever the action is happening. He climbs shorter fences, so a yard with a high fence or lots of land to roam around on would be best for him. Marshall tested positive for heartworms upon arrival and we treated it. He will have to be on heartworm preventative for the rest of his life, however. If you would like to meet him, please contact SCHS at 870-269-5200 or visit him at our shelter at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas. You can also go online at schspets.org and complete an adoption application. UPDATE: Marshall just entered the Paws in Prison Program in Calico Rock. He will receive 8 weeks of obedience training, will be house trained, crate trained and learn tricks too. He will graduate mid February and will be available to meet mid-January. He will be one smart boy!!!",

She will need time and patience to adjust to her new home, but once she trusts you, she won't leave your side!\n\nIn true Doberman fashion Ruby is very loyal to her chosen human and will be a very loyal best friend. She does prefer woman and will need time to adjust and learn to trust any men in the household.\n\nShe is house and crate trained and some of her favorite things to do are snuggling, watching tv, and hanging out with her foster canine sibling! \n\nRuby has a quirky, fun personality and will make you laugh every day! \n\nSchedule a meet and greet and come meet your next best friend! Laprescue.org. \n\nIf you are interested in providing a loving home to this pet please complete the L.A.P. application  https://www.laprescue.org/adoption-app-.html or email us at LapRescue@gmail.com.  Local area adoptions only. Home visits required. Even if you can't give this pet a home you can still help by making a donation to help with their care.

She loves to run and play with toys as well as other dogs and likes everyone she meets. Buffy is also house trained! She was surrendered to us because the owner couldn't give her the care she needed and would jump his small chain link fence and go to the neighbor's for attention. She would be good with other dogs, kids, and cats. If you would like more information, please contact SCHS at 870-269-5200 or visit her at our shelter at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas. You can also go on-line and complete an adoption application at schspets.org. UPDATE: Buffy just entered the Paws in Prison Program in Calico Rock for 8 weeks of training. She will receive obedience training, house trained, crate trained and learn tricks too. She will graduate mid February.",
