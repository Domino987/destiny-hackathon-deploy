He does take medication (mainly in the winter) for his hip due to being run over a year ago. He also has a bad leg from tearing a tendon, but he\u2019s able to run around and sit/lay down normally. He is a country dog for sure. I never had problems with him chasing ducks, chickens, geese, or turkeys. He wasn\u2019t too keen on cats and took him a while to get used to my parents' dogs. He hasn\u2019t been exposed to older children, but he\u2019s been around my infant twin daughters and hasn\u2019t shown any aggression towards them. Blue does seem to be a little slow mentally, but he is a great dog overall and guard dog. \n\nThey described him as protective, loving, and energetic.\n\nOwner will send him with his collar and his medical paperwork. They are not asking a rehoming fee. Just want to make sure he goes to a home I know he would be cared for and treated like part of the family.\n\n*THIS IS A COURTESY POST*\n*THIS DOG IS NOT AT WCHS - All information we have is posted, you must contact with questions/inquiries about adoption NOT WCHS Staff*\n**Owner can be reached at jamieschacher@yahoo.com",

She had major hair loss and it was clear she had birthed many litters. Her owner probably couldn't use her for breeding anymore as she is 9-years-old, so they gave her up. Adrianne has blossomed in foster care with her loving foster family! She knows she is safe now and is learning to experience the good parts of life, probably for the first time! Her hair has grown back in and her body has healed beautifully. She is looking forward to spending her golden years filled with love and treats and pets.",

She came to us from Mexico with her mom and siblings when she was just a baby and was adopted out at around 8 weeks. Unfortunately, she was returned to us a few weeks due to unexpected family changes. She is playful, sweet and affectionate, She has been lovely with children, but at this time, we are requiring her to go to a home without children so she can get the appropriate attention/training that she needs to truly thrive.\n\nShe has some leash aggression, can be a bit unsure around some men and has proven to be quite protective of her family/home so will need a strong leader who can set the right boundaries for her from day 1. With the right amount of exercise and boundaries we know this young girl will thrive. We are offering 2-3 sessions with a trainer to ensure that she is set up for success in her new home.\n\nAn application is the first step and is required to schedule a meeting, without exception. All of our dogs are housed in private foster homes.   Please complete application below, and include any questions in the final section.  Inquiries without applications submitted will be answered as we can. Please note that we do not do out of state adoptions, and a home check and adoption fee are required.\n\nhttps://fs6.formsite.com/themuttscouts/form5/index.html\n\n\nMutt Scouts is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dog rescue dedicated to helping homeless, abused, and abandoned dogs. We are committed to providing proper socialization, training, and medical care for each animal we save, no matter the cost. \n\nPlease visit our website for more information about our organization:\nhttps://www.muttscouts.org/\n\n",

Buddy and Snowy's owner had to have surgery and is having to sell her farm so she contacted us to find Buddy and Snowy a wonderful, Furever farm. \n\nBuddy and Snowy are sweet, gentle dogs. They take a little time to warm up to new people since their job is to guard their livestock. They may even bark at you to let you know they're doing their job. Snowy warms up the quickest and Buddy will follow suit. They will roll over for belly rubs and Snowy is insistent with her Pyr Paw! They walk very nicely on a lead and are so gentle when taking treats from your hand. Buddy does need to be fed separately from livestock as he will resource guarding his food. Buddy and Snowy will come to you neutered/spayed, up to date on vaccines, up to date on flea/tick preventatives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in the home can be 12 years or older. Buddy and Snowy can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. We are able to transport Buddy and Snowy to those states. If you would like to give Buddy and Snowy their furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

Buddy and Snowy's owner had to have surgery and is having to sell her farm so she contacted us to find Buddy and Snowy a wonderful, Furever farm. \n\nBuddy and Snowy are sweet, gentle dogs. They take a little time to warm up to new people since their job is to guard their livestock. They may even bark at you to let you know they're doing their job. Snowy warms up the quickest and Buddy will follow suit. They will roll over for belly rubs and Snowy is insistent with her Pyr Paw! They walk very nicely on a lead and are so gentle when taking treats from your hand. Buddy does need to be fed separate from\nlivestock as he will resource guard his food. Buddy and Snowy will come to you neutered/spayed, up to date on vaccines, up to date on flea/tick preventatives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in the home can be 12 years or older. Buddy and Snowy can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. We are able to transport Buddy and Snowy to those states. If you would like to give Buddy and Snowy their furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

He\u2019s king of the couch. He\u2019s prince of the sun, follow the beams and you\u2019ll find him wrapped in their warmth. He\u2019s mayor of the neighborhood. Loves walks and saying hello to all that will have it. He knows a good dance party when he sees one and throws zoomies out like a professional. He loves toys. He loves to just be with his family in whatever setting. He appreciates dogs but doesn\u2019t love beasts jumping all over him. After all, he\u2019s a gentleman of culture not of the wild. He\u2019s in great health in body, mind, heart and soul. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

            "description": "Kylo. Pitbull mix. Male. 5 years old. Dogs.\n\n\nWhere to even begin as this dog has a past, present and future, that we can just keep writing and writing and writing about. Rough, rough start to life, Kylo was Kilo, and dropped off at the shelter by his \u201cowner\u201d. This action probably, in fact, saved his life. Kilo was emaciated, had severe muscle atrophy in his hind end and a protruding spine. Medically speaking, it seems he grew up in a crate half his size and was left to rot in his own feces and urine. He was a skeleton of a white dog with massive skin infections and a diminished soul.\n\nWhat Kylo didn\u2019t know is that there was an army of love ready to help transform into Kylo the Prince warrior of the underdogs. Kylo has much more story to tell but for starters what you all need to know is that he is a gifted whisperer of life. Kylo is smart. Kylo is clever. Kylo has enough charm to get to the Queen. He has enough heart to heal the world of pain. He has his own idiosyncrasies as us all. He is an individual with depth, simplicity and a desire for savvy and compassionate leadership. We know Kylo extremely well and we are extra protective of his being. He will not ever endure human failure again. So, what is he looking for? A savvy home with little stairs and a yard would be lovely. He does loves walks and adventure. He excels in the ride or die category. No kids. He\u2019s met kids and done very well but again, we are looking for his ultimate success and kids always complicate matters. No cats or ferrets because no one really needs that (no offense). A quiet home who loves the outdoors, snuggling on the couch and is looking for a love like no other. He wouldn\u2019t be upset if his Forever did have a confident and social female canine sister but that\u2019s not a must. Also, walking this dog on leash is like therapy for the soul because that is what he is a SOUL DOG.\n\nKylo is an incredible addition to humans who understand dog, boundaries and individuality. He has more honest love to give than any other dog or human we have ever met. We personally appreciate enjoy putting in the work to gain another\u2019s trust, we look for humans made of the same... \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only.

She\u2019s loving and snuggly. She\u2019s connected down deep... which brings us to her spunky other half as they are bonded. Her sister Coco. She\u2019s about 2 as well. She\u2019s more vivacious and keeps a diary of neighborhood squirrels in her pocket. She\u2019s equally as loving and very bright.

Sake was found on a hot Chicago summer day, lying on a puddle in an alley. Crooked, malnourished body, confused, exhausted mind and a complex soul. This beauty has come so far from the broken she was. Our vet thinks her body shape is from growing growing up in too small of a crate. We have done extensive physical therapy with her where she\u2019s gained new abilities from being fit and leading a life of love. Sake loves to talk. She\u2019s an opinionated woman who knows what she likes. She loves watching TV while lying beside you on the couch. She think she\u2019s a personal acting coach and speaks her mind often aloud. She has many voices. She carries passion in stride. She\u2019s spicy and sweet. She\u2019s looking for a simple life. A quiet life. She is great in the car and has a road trip from Chicago to California under her belt. She LOVES farm life and she loves swimming. She found a new friendship with pigs and even a cat. Sake does prefer to be the only pet indoors. Out door she cares less about what others are doing because she\u2019s busy taking all the inspiration for her next novel... it has something to do with Forever. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only.

We saw her fire and light in trying to defend herself between confusion and fear. We pulled her immediately, thanks to an amazing foster, and on her freedom ride we realized she was deaf. Once that was understood, everything fell into place. Our Queen only continues to grow into her top inspiring self. She is grace. She is humor. She is boss.

Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300.

            "description": "DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE, WE ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS.\nTHANK YOU.\nAnnie and Daisy are both heeler-corgi mixes that were born Aug. 5, 2020. CCK purchased them from a breeder who is retiring and we were concerned for their future. The girls joined CCK at 8 weeks of age and they will soon be 12 weeks old and looking for homes of their own. Given their breeds, these will be ACTIVE dogs and smart\n\nHere's what their foster mom has to say about them:\n\nFirst of all, they are both adorable.  They are good natured, are getting really good at pottying outside, eat well, sleep through the night, and are happy, healthy puppies.  Both are growing well, although Annie is outpacing Daisy.  Annie's legs are longer and her body is longer as well.\n\nAnnie (top) remains the adventure girl.  She is curious, bright, and pretty fearless.  She LOVES to interact with the big dogs, and will seek both Keyna and Marty out for some wrestling.  She is smart enough to be submissive, but young enough to be pesky.  (She also likes to try and play with Rhoslyn, which is hysterical!)  Annie really looks like a Heeler.  Her face is square, her body is lean, and she walks like a Cowboy.  Doug and I both think she'd do really well with other dogs to play with, and she would probably thrive in a situation where she had some work to do--chickens to chase, sheep to pester, etc.  She'd be great on some land.\n \nDaisy (bottom) is a bit more reserved.  She is also curious and bright, but perhaps a little less fearless.  She will also play with the big dogs, but usually does so with Annie, rather than on her own.  Daisy LOVES people and is very affectionate.  She's not a lap puppy--too much energy for that--but she does like a bit of a cuddle when she first wakes up or is ready to go down.  Daisy comes across as a really happy puppy, and is more of a clown than her sister.  She really looks like a corgi.  Her face is triangular, her body is stockier, and her little legs are so short!  Daisy would do very well with other dogs, but I see her as the Princess of her Castle.  She's going to be that loving companion who is happy being with her people, going on walks, and ruling the roost.  \n \nNeither dog is shy or aggressive with people or animals.  They will happily let you pick them up, play with their feet, interrupt their eating, and take things away that they shouldn't have.  No aggression to speak of.  Again, Daisy is gentler and Annie is more assertive, so that would want to be taken into consideration. Our preference is neither of these pups will be placed in a home where there are very small children, under age 7.\n \nBoth girls will have all age appropriate vaccinations and records will be provided. Their adoption fees are $300 each and application may be made through the website link.  www.corgiconnection.com\n",

She is scared and hesitant around strangers at first, especially men, but once she knows you she's as cuddly, playful and funny as they come. She's house and kennel trained and knows sit, shake and down. She's too curious with cats so would do best in a house as the only pet or with a submissive dog. Unsure of how she is with children. If you're looking for an extremely cuddly and loving dog to add to your family, Nala is your girl!\n\nNala's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

Never a dull moment with this guy in the house!\n\nWally will need a forever home with another dog, does not do well with cats, and would do best in a home with older children only. He will also need a 5-6ft fence and most likely would not be a good fit for an apartment.\n\nWally's adoption fee is $300. Meet and greets can be arranged for approved adopters.

I love running in the yard, fresh air, sunshine and ZOOMIES! I do need a fenced-in yard in my forever home, so that I can get all my Zoomies out! I am not a feline fanatic and small animals (squirrels included!) bug me!\n\nCan't resist my smile? Stop by and let me charm my way into your heart!\n\n\nTo find out more about Sasha and to schedule a meet, please email contactus@pawspueblo.org or call 719-543-6464.\n\n*In order to adopt Sasha, a home check is required due to her breed.*\n",

            "description": "Pepper is a 2-3 year old Anatolian girl who has led a rough life so far. She was dumped on some land with her side where she was left outside and fed randomly by the land owner. She has had multiple litters but finally someone stepped in and decided she needed a better life and here she is. After proving to be a smart cookie when getting trapped, Pepper has done a complete 180 on her personality. She was timid, scared and unsure of everything and everyone and now she's in a home environment and loving every minute of it. Pepper is sweet, loving and great with everything and everyone she has met so far. She's good with other dogs, has been around livestock and children. She rides great in the car and has even got great leash skills. Pepper will make someone a fantastic addition to their home and we are so happy to be able to give this girl a second chance.\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Ideally, adopters of dogs in the BLUE category will be knowledgeable in the area(s) the dog will be challenging; therefore, adopters should be willing to participate in a training plan to further the work staff and volunteers already have started. \n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen!

My caretakers at RCHS would describe me as being in the BLUE category.BLUE\u2013 Dogs in the BLUE category will need experienced adopters. Ideally, adopters of dogs in the BLUE category will be knowledgeable in the area(s) the dog will be challenging; therefore, adopters should be willing to participate in a training plan to further the work staff and volunteers already have started. \n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

She also took a little time to warm up to the dog in her foster home but now they are buddies. Nation is potty trained, knows \"sit\" & can \"stay\" when being fed & when exiting a car.

I had found a nice chair with some wheels on it that I figured would be a good enough spot. It was in the sunshine as the sun was coming up. A lady and her foster pup were driving by on the way to the vet and spotted me and stopped to say hi. She brought me some chicken from her lunch, but I came right up to her before she gave me any. She gave me one piece, and I let her put a leash on me, and I hopped right in her car with another piece. I hardly even realized there was another dog in the car! I was just so hungry! Since becoming a Streetdog over the past few years, I have overcome heartworms, gotten healthy, learned my indoor dog manners, worked on some basic training, and even flown on a private plane two times, and it was so much fun! I have a great time playing with other dogs, but would probably fit best in a home with no cats or young children because they make me super nervous! I am a lover for sure, and get very attached to my humans! I am looking for a foster home or, even better, a forever home and would be so grateful if you would give me a chance and open your hearts!\n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

Gumball is loving, friendly, and incredibly smart. He has a huge fan club at the shelter that can attest to how wonderful he really is! Gumball loves his rough and rowdy friends in playgroup, too, and while he can be dog selective, he has the potential to live with another dog if it's the right fit. Gumball is strong on the leash, but such a softie at heart. He is really looking for a home where he can share his silly smile, wonderful personality, and big heart with the ones he loves!",

High energy when on walks but she\u2019ll sleep for most of the day.\nCan be handled/touched: Yes\nBarker: Somewhat\nEscape Artist: No. She is great at staying within room boundaries within the home. She does not try to escape outside without her leash/harness on.\nFood Aggressive: No\nWalks on Leash: Yes\nRides Well in Car: Rides well in a crate.\nNeeds a home with a yard: ideally as she has high energy, and likes to have her space to run around and play.\nNeeds Another Dog: No, should be the only dog in home.\nCan live in an apartment: No\n\nBackstory: Tammy (aka Trixie) was pulled from a high killl shelter in Georgia. She was set to be euthanized the day she was pulled. She is a really sweet girl, she loves her people and is a little dog selective. Would do best as an only dog to start out. She could be trained to gain more confidence and possibly be introduced to other dogs.\n\nFoster comments:\nAs her foster, we have found Trixie to be a loving and playful dog when she is within our home and backyard. Trixie warmed up to us within the first few days of her staying with us. She is a very sweet girl and she loves and shows affection for the people that have gained her trust.\n\nTrixie loves to smell and stalks squirrels/rabbits in our backyard. Make sure you have a well fenced in backyard or large farm with space to run and play. Trixie can become very excited when it\u2019s time for walkies and jumps a bit because of her excitement getting into her leash/harness. She walks decently on a leash however she does pull when she catches a good scent or sight. She can become overstimulated easily and she will need some training to learn how to meet and interact with other dogs and their humans. She might be best as an only dog in your house. During the day she loves to sleep beside us while my husband and I work from home.\n\nTrixie is a smart dog. She is properly crate trained. She goes into her crate easily with the motivation of a treat or a simple hand motion when it\u2019s time for bed. She\u2019s only ever barked in her crate for bed time the first night a few times. She is house broken and has never peed or pooped within our house. When she needs to go outside of scheduled walk times she becomes a little restless and that\u2019s her signal she needs to go outside for a bathroom break.\n\nWhen we first got Trixie, she did not know any commands. She is smart and now responds to \u201ccome\u201d and \u201csit\u201d in the short time we\u2019ve had her. We\u2019re positive she\u2019s capable of learning more commands. Trixie does not try to steal human food, during meals she will silently beg, but after a few minutes she\u2019ll give up and lay down.\n\nShe loves toys and will destroy them. So make sure to get the durable, long lasting ones. She loves her Kong rope toy fox (once she removed the squeakers and stuffing) and her flexible chew ball, she\u2019ll play with these toys daily. Every couple days, she\u2019ll get a case of the zoomies, which is adorable. So make sure to have a few toys on hand when that happens. She has some resource guarding tendencies with her toys, however, if she gets a hold of a non-toy it can easily be switched out with either a real toy or a treat.",

He\u2019s deaf. That creates a huge communication gap.\n2. He has separation anxiety. Which can be attributed to being deaf.\n\nWe are seeking a home that will be experienced with Great Danes and also be home more often than not.\n\nA wire crate won\u2019t do. Someone should be able to proved a more structured enclosure like a dog run.\n\nNow that I got most of the bad stuff out of the way. Let\u2019s move on to some good stuff.\n\nPolar is housetrained. He has been around other animals. He DOES know \u201csit\u201d and \u201ccome\u201d with hand commands.\n\nOnce I got his attention he did sit. With more time a positive bond will be created with him which will help him look to a human for his well-being.\n\n563-263-7358",

It was clear when we picked her up that she had not felt the love of human touch in her life; however that hasn't stopped her from soaking in all the love. Her foster says she is a \"gentle soul\" and has great manners and takes correction very well. This rockstar mom took such good care of her babies and now it is her turn to live the happy life. Autumn is fully vetted, heartworm negative and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick medicine. Autumn's adoption fee is $200.00. \n\nIf you are interested in giving this girl the life she deserves, please fill out an application at: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/SFP/Dog",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Harley and I\u2019m a big, beautiful, 8 yr. old girl. Not much is known about me before coming into IEBR, I was dropped off at a shelter with eye and ear infections as well as a UTI. The good news is all of that is cleared up and the doctor says that I\u2019m in good shape \u2013 well except for a few pounds (ok, maybe 10) I need to lose.\nI LOVE PEOPLE! I love being around them, I love attention, I love soft beds and I love toys and bones to chew on! I have very good manners, I sit, stay, walk on the leash and am completely housetrained. No accidents here! \n\nThere\u2019s a cat in my foster home and at first I wanted to chase it, but my foster parents told me no. Now the cat comes up to me and rubs all over my face \u2013 it\u2019s annoying but I never bark or try to get it. I also have a foster dog sister and so far we get along pretty well. We go outside and lay in the sun together and go on walks together. We still get separated when we have bones to chew on or toys to play with because we\u2019re still getting to know each other.\n\nI\u2019m crate trained and go to it on my own at night and for naps. I don\u2019t have any signs of food aggression \u2013 I wait my turn for treats and patiently wait for my foster sister to finish eating before I check and see if she left anything in her bowl. I don\u2019t bark at the door and when someone comes in, I\u2019m very polite. I love, love, love bananas and apples as treats.\n\nI can be a little silly when it comes time to play, I throw my toys up in the air and try to catch them - it\u2019s kind of funny to watch. I\u2019m 8 so my bursts of silliness are short and then I need a nap. I\u2019d love a home where there are plenty of comfortable spots to nap, lots of treats and people to spoil me.\n\nIf you are interested in Harley, please visit our website: www.ilenglishbulldogrescue.org, and read through our adoption criteria to see if you meet our requirements. If you do, please fill out an application to adopt.\n\nHarley's adoption fee is: $450.00\n\nVisit us on Facebook: Visit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IllinoisEnglishBulldogRescue",

Chubbs will be ready to go towards the end of October. The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00 + tax and that includes their vaccinations, spay or neuter, rabies and microchip. Our dogs are also heartworm negative (or we will cover their treatment). To start the process please visit our website and fill out the adoption application (www.dfwrescueme.org/adoption-application) and from there the foster family can answer any questions and arrange a time to meet.

Louie is approximately 8 years old and weighs 65 pounds.  \n\nLouie is a sweet boy that loves to cuddle and act like a lap dog.  He is mostly lab or perhaps a Red Fox Lab.   Louie is fairly low energy but loves to run in our fenced in area and play with a deflated soccer ball.  Silly boy.\n\nLouie enjoys napping and hanging with his peeps. He has some toy guarding and food guarding behaviors so would do best as an only dog and no children.\nLouie does jump when excited and he is a big boy so he needs a dog savvy owner.\n\nLouie has questionable history with former owners and we think he was forced in and out of a crate regularly so he is not amenable to being forced to do things.  Poor Louie wanted nothing more than to be with his people.  But, he is such a sweet fella, that he usually doesn't need to be forced to do much.  Louie would love a quiet home without children or other pets.  He would love to have a human around most of the time to spoil him.  Louie would also prefer a fenced in yard to run when he gets the urge.  \n\nHis admirers say that he is an amazing dog and deserves understanding and pampering.\nLouis has been waiting a long time for his forever home. Is it with you?\n\nPlease go to our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application if you are interested in meeting Louie.  Local homes only please!\n",

This 5-year old, 73-pound package of love is residing with our friends at Pope Memorial Humane Society in Dover, NH. We think she deserves a special home because she\u2019s a special girl! \n\n Gerty is a smiley dog who loves car rides, toys, treats, and very leisurely walks. Her toys of choice are tennis balls and tug ropes. \n\nSweet Gerty is a gentle, loyal girl who just wants a laid back family to love.  Committed adopters who will give her time and space to adjust to her new home are on top of her wish list! \n\nGerty's ideal home will be with adults that enjoy the quiet life style that she enjoys, and if you're looking for a buddy to accompany you on errands, Gerty is your girl! She is the best car buddy ever! A home with a fenced yard would be lovely (just to hang out and fetch those tennis balls!) but it's not a requirement. Any children should be 14+ and dog-savvy, and she needs a home without other pets. \n\nGerty has had the opportunity to spend time in the home of a shelter staff member, and she was the perfect guest. She is house trained, non-destructive, and quiet....what more could you ask for?\n\nApplications must be submitted online: https://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application/. Pope Memorial Humane Society is open by appointment only at this time. Applications will be reviewed as soon as possible. Please, no phone calls. If you have specific questions, email adoption@popememorialcvhs.org Please tell them ARK sent you!!! #ARKforGerty\n\n \nTHIS IS A COURTESY POST PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS.\n \n\n",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Wednesday evenings, 5 - 7 PM and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nThis sweet lady is 10 year old Finesse.  She\u2019s a very special dog and we\u2019re looking for a very special home for her.  As you can probably tell, Finesse had a horrendous case of flea dermatitis which caused her skin to be just about raw, hence the sweater.  She\u2019s currently in a foster home and has settled in well with the resident dog and people as well.  Finesse currently weighs about 63 pounds.  The adoption fee we\u2019re asking is a donation to PAWS and a lifetime commitment to provide for Finesse comfort and care for the rest of her days.  She deserves nothing less.  \n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

I will eat anything you're willing to give me because FOOD!! Unfortunately I have found myself homeless and I am looking for the PERFECT home for me to land in! I am a PEOPLE-PLEASER and willing to WORK for your attention, or the treat in your pocket ;) I am looking for an active home that will take me on long walks or even hikes! No couch potatoes shall apply!! I can be a nervous nelly so my days are best spent with structure and routine so I know what to expect! I prefer a quiet home who will reinforce and incorporate my training into my daily routine. I am crate trained and LOVE my crate which is my safe place! I currently have a Lab brother, but I'm very picky with other doggy friends so I would prefer a dog/animal free home. Kids are loud and unpredictable so I'd prefer no kids in the home! \n\nI am planning to go to training camp and I am currently looking for a place to land (foster or adopter!) when I get out! Do you think you are a good fit for me?\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.\n\n\n",

She is friendly and affectionate with everyone, although her exuberance for life may make her a better fit in a home without small children or anyone unsteady on their feet. Strawberry would make a great exercise buddy. Her idea of a perfect day would be to start off with a food puzzle, followed by a hike or maybe an agility lesson or splash in the kiddie pool, time to romp around in a backyard, then a training session or nosework for her dinner, and a cuddle session to finish her day. \n\nThis smarty pants aced her C.L.A.S.S. training program so she holds attention, has leash up manners, waits at the door, comes when called, abides by loose leash walking, offers a polite greeting, waits for the food bowl, and knows 'leave it,' 'stay,' 'give' and 'take' (trades valuable objects), in addition to two tricks! She has a history of ear infections so she experiences sensitivity around her head and ears, but that doesn't prevent her from being a loving cuddlebug. Adopt Strawberry and she'll help you meet all your fitness goals!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Strawberry go to bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

DOB 3-17-18), female, 25 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed and micro-chipped. Paxton and Waverly were homeless strays at the shelter in NC; they have an interesting relationship where Waverly depends on Paxton for confidence and is the decision maker but isn't a confident dog. She gets fearful in new situations where she doesnt. Waverly is crate trained, potty trained, seems to show a prey drive toward yard animals (no cats please), good with her 10 year old humans, loves attention, and is highly motivated by treats and affection. her best home would be home more often than not; she is incredibly sweet and thrives on affection and attention. She would love to be on oversized lap dog for someone. Stay tuned for more information as Paxton and Waverly are a new rescues!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Paxton and Waverly please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He would do fine with older children, but younger children wouldn't be a good fit due to his jumping and being mouthy. He would do best in an active home to get plenty of exercise. Paxton needs an experienced dog family that knows how to manage puppy behaviors. Paxton needs a lot of stimulation and attention as well as down time in his crate to gather himself. He is super smart! He loves learning and games. He would likely make a great little agility dog. Stay tuned for more information as Paxton and Waverly are a new rescues!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Paxton and Waverly please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

She was rescued in Carson City and is currently in Los Angeles. She is 3 years old and 58 pounds. She is very affectionate, loving and kissy, and tries to be a lap dog. She is playful with other dogs, minds well, is fully crate trained, and loves to chew on bully sticks and antlers and horns. She is a little nervous meeting new people but will warm up nicely. She is food motivated and easy to train. \n\nShe loves food, of course. She'll be gentle in taking treats, she just needs to be reminded to be easy. And she loves bully sticks, antlers, horns, anything tough but safe for her.\n\nShe adores toys. She has her favorites that she plays with. And then there are the others that she'll de-squeak if she can. She has toys all over the house so that she always has one. \n\nShe loves attention. And she likes to be with everyone. But she's also independent and will entertain herself. \n\nShe is happy with other dogs. She'll play sometimes but mostly she just likes to be near them. And she'll cuddle with other dogs too.\n\nShe takes her meds easily. She does get a bit anxious if meals are a bit late. I assume because the prednisone keeps her a constant state of hunger. But she is good about a schedule. And she's very routine. \n\nShe is crate trained. She loves her crate. She is only in it if we're both gone. But she'll willing go crate if needed. Especially when a treat is involved. And she eats in her crate so she doesn't try to get anyone else's food or treat.\n\nShe's potty trained. Just gotta remind her to go out regularly. She will pee if startled. Gentle handling required. \n\nShe's also becoming a good watch dog. She'll bark at noises or odd things. But she quiets when told. \n\nShe's still nervous on leash. But I assume it's because she hasn't had enough exposure or time outside because the prednisone requires her to be quarantined in the house. She is good in the car though. \n\nShe's specific and routine and likes her schedule. She may seem high maintenance. But she's super easy. And she's a super cool girl with tons of love to give. And totally worth it.",

Due to unfortunate circumstances and covid, they are now up for adoption. They will be approximately 2 years old in March and originally rescued from Mississippi by Red Rock. Lady Mary has the curly thicker hair and Lady Edith has more of the lab appearance. They are bonded sisters and do everything together - eat, sleep, and play. They are great with cats, children of all ages, and love to run and play outside. This fun loving pair would be a great addition to just about any home.\n\nThe girls weigh about 50 pounds each .",

(Better pictures coming soon.)\n\nFranz came to us when his family lost everything in a house fire and were not able to provide for him any longer. Franz is leash trained, crate trained, housebroken and good with all. He absolutely loves people and other dogs. Franz has an old healed pelvic (hips) injury which will limit his activity and thus he is probably not a good fit for a home with young energetic dogs or kids or a family looking for a hiking dog. But he does love easy walks, being out and about, and hanging with his people and calm dog buddies. Our orthopedic specialist says Franz's prior healed injury is best managed with medication and gentle exercise. Franz is currently in a foster home and doing great but he'd love a Forever Home to call his own. Could that home be yours? Email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org. Franz is located in Southern California.",

The bite wound on his under arm has healed completely and he has completed his mandatory 4 month quarantine and is officially available for adoption. The intake veterinarian estimated that Porkchopwas approximately five years old \u2013 if this is so, he is a very young five! Porkchop is full of puppy energy! Porkchop is deaf (as white/Merle dogs often are) but his pretty blue eyes can see just fine. Porkchop is good with other dogs but needs a tolerant dog that will put up with his boisterous nature. A patient dog that will show him the ropes and be his \u201cears\u201d would be ideal. Porkchop is great with people but due to his deafness we would rather not place him in a home with a toddler or small child that might accidentally startle him. We would love for his new family to take him through a basic obedience course and work on hand signals. Porkchop is a smart boy and willing to learn! Porkchop has been neutered & vaccinated and will be microchipped and heartworm tested prior to adoption. If you\u2019re interested in adding this drop dead gorgeous boy your family, please fill out an application at www.companimals.org. Adoption $250",

            "description": "IRELAND is a 1 year old pitbull mix who is found in Philadelphia tied to a pole. She is a fun loving girl who is always in motion! Ireland is currently working with our dog trainer to learn how to be Zen. She will make an excellent hiking buddy! Ireland is reactive through a fence but when nose to nose she gets along with other dogs. We are working on her socialization as well and she may be able to be in a home with a calm male dog who will give her a positive influence. Ireland loves people but is too active for young children at this time. She is a typical wiggle butt however she will also head butt and could topple a toddler. Ireland has been spayed, vaccinated, micro chipped and heartworm tested. Her new family must make a commitment to continue with her obedience classes with our trainer or yours. Adoption $250. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org if you are the active family that Ireland is looking for.",

This Bloodhound/ Plott Hound mix will stay on the trail as good as his iconic human counterpart. The great thing is he does quite well on the leash (but could always use some training refreshers), so you can be his trusty sidekick on the hunt! Again, true to character, Clint is selective in his dog friends, although he is quite fond of the larger ladies.\n\nThis boy will take an owner of equal strength, energy, and confidence. When the correct match is made, it's sure be \"Sudden Impact\"! \n\nStop by our website today, www.hillcountryspca.com to fill out an application for Clint Eastwood, he'll be sure to go over all your information to ensure you'll be the best fit for his active and adventurous lifestyle!

She enjoys the company of equally calm dogs. We can\u2019t wait to bring this sweet chill girl back to Brooklyn for lots of love and care!

            "description": "ANDY is a happy-go-lucky guy despite the incredible ordeal he's been through. Back in May 2020 he was alone on a reservation, no one helped him. He had an infection so bad he was septic. He body was so filled with pus (infection) that the pus formed a saddle of sorts on his rump. To top it off, a car hit him and he was left there to die. He's also been blinded in one  eye :-( His story is here: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3563139430373997&id=111176198903688\n\nFast forward to a very grateful and loving guy who likes his back scratched :-) This fella loves to hang out with. He doesn't really need another dog buddy, sadly no one taught him how to play :-( He'll happily accompany you around the garden/yard, take naps in the sun....but he truly prefers being inside and wants to ensure that he will always come inside with you. \n\nCurrently he is sleeping in a large plastic kennel/crate and cleanup in the morning is less than 5 minutes (fortunately, he's a \"hard nugget\" kind of pooper ;-) There are other options to explore though too -- diapers, laser accupuncture, various gadgets that strap on like a harness that basically catch poop with a poop bag.\n\nIf you have a soft heart and can be a little creative with the sphincter issue, he is a delightful affectionate dog.\n\nHis adoption fee includes his neutering, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, microchip. He has had his tail removed due to his circumstances - barely a nub there. We estimate he was born in 2015.\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy.\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application. (Please do not call or text).\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal(s). If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this.\n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you.\n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets.\n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets if you have any.\n\nAt the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we) socially distanced as much as possible and have hand sanitizer.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please.\n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos etc will do :-)\n\nThank you!\n\n",

He's a great pup who has just about everything an adopter could ask for.Bobby is good looking, which is obvious. He's outgoing once he leaves his kennel. He thinks cuddles are cool, but he also believes exercise is important, and enjoys outdoor time for a good run around the backyard.He may come off as a bit bashful when first introduced, but don't worry! Bobby doesn't stay that way. He quickly assesses the situation and knows you're going to be his newest best friend.Bobby does need to practice walking on a leash. He tends to get excited when he's out and about, but he's a smart dog. He'll learn those skills quickly. He already knows how to sit, and he's ready for his family to teach him more!

She was supposed to be returned to the owners after her pups were weaned but they would not take her back because she was spayed and they waned to breed her again. She is good with people once she is sure she is going to be ok she can be very loving to the people she knows.

            "description": "***Rachel is currently located at our rescue in Georgia but also available for adoption in the New Jersey and surrounding areas.***\n\nRachel appeared at the home of a local resident one day fully pregnant and close to delivering her pups. After her four pups were old enough to be moved, we took them all into our rescue. Her pups were adopted pretty quickly but Rachel, who was heartworm positive at the time, had to remain with us while she regained her health and eventually treated for her heartworms. Now that she's healthy, Rachel is ready to find her new home.\n\nRachel is a very friendly, calm girl who really just wants a human friend that she can love and trust in. While her initial reaction towards new people is to bark at them, Rachel turns to mush quickly once she realizes you're not a threat to her or her home. She's laid back, calm (yet very playful) and enjoys just being part of whatever her people are doing. While she initially got along very well with other dogs and may be again, Rachel now seems perfectly content being the only dog. Because of her initial reaction to new people, we'd not consider a home with young children at this time.\n\nBesides being treated for her heartworms, Rachel has also been fully vetted and kept on her monthly preventatives since coming to us. She's gotten a bit overweight in her time with us but she'll trim down once she has a home that allows for more exercise time. Rachel appears to have some housetraining experience but may need additional training.\n\nIf interested in adopting Rachel, please submit an application at socorescue.com (no need to register or login)",

He was found roaming the streets of Pasco County with a pretty bad case of demodex when a kind person took him in and asked us to take him into our rescue. He is now healed, his hair is growing back, and he is ready for his forever family. He is all puppy and loves to run and play so a fenced yard would be a requirement. He is neutered,  up to date on his vaccines and ready to go! \nIf you are interested in adopting Bruno please copy our application link into your browser and complete: https://daniellethedogrescuer.wufoo.com/forms/zq5l29b022pyq0/\nAdopters must be located within a 30 mile radius of Trinity,  FL 34655.\nPlease no calls or texts!",

            "description": "Meet Darcy\nDarcy is a beautiful Labrador retriever mix. We rescued her from a high-kill shelter and put her on her Freedom Ride for Life. She arrived on October 10, 2020. \nDarcy is 2.6 years of age. She has a gorgeous black coat and is of medium size at 46 pounds. She\u2019s fully grown and shouldn\u2019t get bigger. Darcy is sweet and affectionate. She loves being with people and she is friendly with other dogs. We have yet to test her with kitties and will do so for potential adopters. Darcy loves to play in the yard and she walks well on a leash, hoping that you\u2019ll take long walks with her. Darcy is trying hard to be brave, but we can see she is struggling with all the changes in her life. She\u2019s feeling a bit uncertain. She tries so hard, but every now and again, something will frighten her and she retreats into herself hoping that someone will come for her soon.\nDarcy had a hard life before coming to our shelter. She could sure use some TLC to help her thrive. If you\u2019re looking for a young, beautiful dog, with so many of the wonderful qualities that a Labrador has, Darcy may be the one. She is going to make for a wonderful companion to that special someone. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

We put her on her Freedom Ride for Life and she arrived on October 10, 2020. \nCallie is a pretty 1.6 year old American Bulldog. She is currently at 63 pounds, but we think her ideal weight is 65-70 pounds. She has a pretty white coat with brown patches over her ears. Callie is such a hoot. She is incredibly friendly. She loves being with people and loves playing with other dogs. She loves to run and romp in the yard. Callie is very affectionate and welcomes attention, a lot of it! Callie has quickly become a shelter favorite with her bubbly personality. We haven\u2019t yet tested her with cats, but will for potential adopters. \nCallie is going to make for a wonderful companion. She is a fantastic girl with so much to offer her family or person. She has been done wrong in her young life, but she has moved on and just wants to get on with living and loving with her forever family. This girl is a keeper! \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.Teddy is one of those great dogs that moves right in and feels like he has always been a family member. A sweet, happy temperament has always been what he is about. In fact, when asked to describe him, his foster said 'Teddy is just a happy boy. Always dancing and tail wagging. He did well with 5 dogs. He has great manners. Does all his business outside!' An outstanding family dog, Teddy is ready to love you with all his heart. He has had all his shots and been vet checked. He is ready to go! This friendly, outgoing boy is going to bring you smiles every day.A note from Teddy's foster: Teddy aka Teddy Bear is... a snuggler, a cuddler, a love bug boy. His coat is soft and lush. Teddy Bear gets along with my 2 senior dogs and especially my 16+yr old lab - they play a lot. He loves to go on walks in my neighborhood and the park and is friendly with everyone he meets. He is also house broken. I have had him a little over a week and I have had no issues. He would make a wonderful addition to a furever home. Our Teddy didn't have the easiest past. A positive training program will be required to help him catch up on all that he missed and will also help him to be your best boy. Update- No cats for Teddy. He's a bit too interested. If you are interested in Teddy, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://reachoutrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4588 Or contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

CHEVY!!!! This handsome fellow has the most joyful hop, skip and jump when he sees you! He literally approaches you doing the most adorable happy dance that can only make you smile when you see his little airborne leaps and wiggles!\n\nAnd talk about smiles??? He has the most engaging grin, which is only matched by that BOOP-able nose and molten hazel eyes. Just like the car, our Chevy is a classic! And we're not gonna lie ... he is a world class snuggler! With this boy you will be well loved and well exercised!!!\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Chevy, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Chevy, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

She loves playing outside in the yard. She is crate trained and is working on housetraining. She gets better and better every day.

Mac was found as a stray at 4 months of age and has spent his entire life at a rural shelter. He's never had a chance to learn about living in the real world till now. Hes currently enrolled in and residing at a board and train program near Sarasota FL where he has learned many new life skills as well as how to adjust to life outside the shelter. Mac would do best in a home with a fenced yard (did we mention the boy LOVES fetch lol) and due to his size and exuberance - free of small children. Mac and his adopter will benefit from continuing in his training and will receive free ongoing support for 6 months from adoption.!!!!!! Your reward for this commitment will be one of the MOST LOVING, FUN dogs ever!Visit Macs Facebook Page: (https://www.facebook.com/110406950568871/posts/178083050467927/) to see his popularity with many followers and view many, many photos showing his AWESOMENESS!If you are interested in McDougal, or have any questions, please email sheena726@me.com or call 727-642-8937.~~If you are interested in this animal, you can complete a questionnaire at http://www.hbpr.org/hb-adopt-web.html, email homeward@ellijay.com, contact us on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HBPR30540/ or call 706-698-4663.Thank you for considering a rescue dog or cat!

She will stare into your soul with those big brown eyes and next thing ya know, the whole bag of treats is gone! \n\nPumpkin loves kids! She does okay with cats, but would prefer to be an only dog in the home. Her foster mom has worked very hard on socializing her and introducing her to all kinds of new environments. She's done so well and has become such a good girl! We would love to find her a home that is willing to take her to a few training classes after her adoption to ensure she adjusts well \n\nShe is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, kennel trained, potty trained and ready for her own home!

            "description": "Rasta is 3 years old and weighs 65 pounds. She is a truly gorgeous dog with beautiful coloring and green eyes. She is active, but does have her calm moments (usually when indoors). She's a smart gal and knows a couple commands: sit, come, stay. She is doing well with her leash training, but can pull a bit. Rasta must be the only pet in her household and would not be a good candidate for dog parks. Rasta does not like to be startled/woken up or to suddenly have someone get in her space without warning. This scares her. Due to this, she should not be around younger children. If someone suddenly gets in her face, she will growl or snap to let you know it spooked her and that she doesn't appreciate it. She has never bitten anyone. Rasta is sweet, goofy, loyal and just wants to love and be loved. She loves to cuddle and really enjoys attention from her family. Her adoption fee is $350 and covers the cost of her spay, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019re interested in adopting, the first step is completing an adoption application which is available on our website, Poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the following paragraphs for additional information about our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

I'm afraid of the rain and vacuum cleaners, and I will need to be in a home with no children.\n\nI will do best with someone patient and who can help me to gain my confidence, as well as has experience with minor resource guarding.\"\n\nJax will need to be adopted into a home where there is just one caregiver/owner. He does not do well with multiple people/owners in one house, and will need a calm home, without people coming in and out of the house. He will need to be kenneled at all times with a stranger coming in.\n\nDog is a pretty high-jumper....he will need a very secure yard with at least a 6 ft fence/wall.\n\nIf you would like to meet Jax, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

She gave birth to a number of litters but will have no more.  Mama is about 5 years old and has been spayed. She was treated for heartworms and had  a dental with a number of broken teeth removed.  What was she trying to eat or escape from that caused these broken teeth?   She had a severe allergic skin infection which has been treated and her fur is growing in soft.   She is up to date on her vaccinations and has been microchipped.\n\nEven though she has had to bear so much hardship, she is the sweetest girl. It is hard to understand how she can have such an amazing temperament.  She loves to snuggle, be scratched, rubbed and petted, and go on walks. She knows sit including sitting on her haunches.  She so wants to please.  We know she does fine with older children; cats unknown.  She is fine with calm male dogs but tends to want to be the alpha with females.  She would do fine as an only dog.\n\nShe\u2019s a beautiful black and white bully breed maybe mixed with a hunting dog of some sort weighing in at 50 pounds. Her foster mom reports she is a keeper.   She was rescued with a young male staffie/border collie mix who has been adopted.  Was this dog, Peanut, her son?  See the photo above with the two dogs and you decide.\n\nIf you can provide a loving, forever home for this girl, you will have a loving, forever friend.  Go to www.freedomstreetrescue.org to complete an online application.  For more information, email Rhonda at rhondabarron@earthlink.net\n\n",

            "description": "This sweet girl deserves a loving forever home where she can be spoiled as she had such a hard life before being rescued.  She gave birth to a number of litters but will have no more.  Mama is about 5 years old and has been spayed. She was treated for heartworms and had  a dental with a number of broken teeth removed.  What was she trying to eat or escape from that caused these broken teeth?   She had a severe allergic skin infection which has been treated and her fur is growing in soft.   She is up to date on her vaccinations and has been microchipped.\n\nEven though she has had to bear so much hardship, she is the sweetest girl. It is hard to understand how she can have such an amazing temperament.  She loves to snuggle, be scratched, rubbed and petted, and go on walks. She knows sit including sitting on her haunches.  She so wants to please.  We know she does fine with older children; cats unknown.  She is fine with calm male dogs but tends to want to be the alpha with females.  She would do fine as an only dog.\n\nShe\u2019s a beautiful black and white bully breed maybe mixed with a hunting dog of some sort weighing in at 50 pounds. Her foster mom reports she is a keeper.   She was rescued with a young male staffie/border collie mix who has been adopted.  Was this dog, Peanut, her son?  See the photo above with the two dogs and you decide.\n\nIf you can provide a loving, forever home for this girl, you will have a loving, forever friend.  Go to www.freedomstreetrescue.org to complete an online application.  For more information, email Rhonda at rhondabarron@earthlink.net\n",

She has also passed her Canine Good Citizen Test!\n\nHere is a little bit about her. \n\nBELLA -  Unique Bella, despite her challenges in life Bella always has a smile, you can't hold this girl down!  Bella is insecure about her deformity and does not do well with dominant dogs but if you give her time and show her that they are not going to hurt her or pick on her she would love a friend to play with.  \n\nShe loves attention and will give you inspiration to put your best foot forward daily as she does.  Bella loves to learn new skills and is extremely obedient.  She is playful and enjoys a good romp but needs time to rest between exercises.  If you are looking for a strong willed partner in crime, Bella is the one for you!\n\nBella is about 2 years old and she is a medium size mixed breed gal.\n\nIf she is just what you are looking for in a companion please apply to adopt Bella at: empirerescue.org.",

            "description": "Hi I am Bentli! I am a three-year-old medium sized (about 45 pounds) Pitbull-mix female. Everyone who meets me says \u201cwow she is smaller than I expected!\u201d I am house trained and also know how to sit and shake but would really enjoy learning some other commands. If I have my Lola collar on, then I am great at walking on a leash! My biggest fear is disappointing my foster family as I am a huge people pleaser! \n\nI am shy at first but once I warm up to you, you\u2019ll learn very quickly that I\u2019m a high energy lady that is obsessed with cuddles. I will try to be in your lap at all times. You\u2019ll know we\u2019ve bonded when I show you my belly to rub and when I give you sloppy kisses. There is no such thing as too many cuddles or pets for me! I am crate trained but I prefer to be with my human when possible. I would prefer to be the only dog in my forever home as I want all the love and affection focused on me. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to run all over your backyard and get out my zoomies! Running around multiple times a day is the best! My favorite things to chase are birds and squirrels. It\u2019s a fun game! Your fence should be at least 6 feet tall because I can jump like it\u2019s no one\u2019s business! Running also helps me get out my anxiety. I\u2019m not sure if I am faster at running or gobbling down my breakfast/dinner. I sure love when it\u2019s time to eat!\n\nI also love going on car rides, so don\u2019t hesitate to take me with you to low-key places like walks and your local home improvement store. Because I\u2019m an active gal, I would love to go on runs with you or even go on a hike that isn\u2019t too populated with other people and other dogs.\n\nI love my single ladies! If there is a man in the house, you will need to be patient with me; but with time, and small doses of exposure, I will accept him. Dog-savvy kids 8 years old and up would be fine to have around, but young kids kinda scare me because of how unpredictable they are. If you are someone who has lots of friends over, or friends with other dogs or young kids, I would prefer to be in the comfort of my crate. Due to my anxiety I can be shy and a little scared and vocal at first, but I will warm up to you and your guests once I am no longer overwhelmed. Even though I\u2019m crate trained, I can sometimes get a little chatty while in my crate, but it\u2019s just to remind you of my presence.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a fun-loving, active pup to be your loyal companion, then I\u2019m the girl for you! Let\u2019s meet! Please fill out an adoption application to see if we are a match \u2013 https://www.mustluvboxersrescue.com/adopt.",

Aria came to us when her previous owner could no longer care for her, but Aria has been having a great time since she came here. She is a very sweet dog and will make an excellent addition to any family. Aria does prefer to be the only dog in the home. If you would like to meet her, please contact us at adoptions at 505-983-4309 x 1610 or email us at adoption@sfhumanesociety.org If you have another dog at home, please bring them in for a meet n' greet. Aria's adoption fee is $130 which includes her spay surgery, a microchip, age appropriate vaccinations and 30 days of complimentary pet insurance. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. We're excited to announce that our training classes have become virtual and are facilitated through Zoom meetings. See https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for more information about schedules and registration for online training classes.

            "description": "Breed:  Yorkshire Terrier\nAge:  8 yrs.\nWeight:  13 lbs.\nGood with dogs:  yes\nGood with cats:  unsure\nGood with kids:  unsure\nEnergy level:  low\nGood with men/strangers:  yes\nHypoallergenic:  no\n\nSpecial home requirements or medical:  must be the only pets in the home\n\nAdditional info:\n\nIvy and Pippa are a bonded pair and must be adopted together. These girls are two peas in a pond and are 2 perfect little book ends.   They can get overwhelmed easily so they are looking for a quiet and calm home with no other pets as they want to be the babies in the household. Pippa adjusts pretty easily, but it does take Ivy some time to get used to new environments so she will need some time and patience in her new home. Pippa is pee pad trained, but Ivy does need to be taken out often so they need a home that has a fully enclosed patio or yard where there is easy access to take Ivy out often. They are low energy, cuddly little ladies, that are crate trained, easy going and calm.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

These girls are two peas in a pond and are 2 perfect little book ends. They can get overwhelmed easily so they are looking for a quiet and calm home with no other pets as they want to be the babies in the household. Pippa adjusts pretty easily, but it does take Ivy some time to get used to new environments so she will need some time and patience in her new home. Pippa is pee pad trained, but Ivy does need to be taken out often so they need a home that has a fully enclosed patio or yard where there is easy access to take Ivy out often. They are low energy, cuddly little ladies, that are crate trained, easy going and calm.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:\n1.       Visit www.dogswithoutborders.org\n2.

I'm very sweet and quite resilient. I love getting visitors here on the ranch and would be a great greeter at your front door! I love playing catch but I don't like to give the ball back. I am also very comfortable on leash and love to go for walks. I can be protective over my things and my home so new visitors aren't always the best. I can't imagine anything better than finding a home with a great big yard for me to release all of my energy. I would much rather have a relaxing day in with you at home, and am pretty independent. Because of this picking me up is a no no because I like to show how I'm an independent pupper. I am fairly well-trained, but I would love to learn more new skills when I join your family. A home with older kids and no small animals is best. I hope to be a part of your family!",

She was transferred from another shelter, so we do not know her history.\nShe is currently being treated for a non contagious skin condition, but is adoptable.\nIvy went to a foster to adopt home for a short period of time where we learned that she really really really likes to play with cats.  But was a little to friendly with the cat in the home, so she was brought back to the shelter. \nIf you are interested in meeting her please call the shelter (520) 458-4151 to schedule an appointment.\n",

To apply read about our adoption policies\nhere\nto fill out an application.\nHey there! Let me tell you a bit about myself. My name is Pandy aka Pandora. I am CARA's longest resident. Not sure why because I am very special. Maybe it is because of my breed. Despite being so stressed out in my kennel here, when I am lucky enough to leave my kennel and spend time with the humans here, I make the MOST of it! I will graciously sit in their lap and get all the snuggles, or sit very pretty for a treat. I LOVE food, so I will be easy to train! I have very good home manners, the only thing I need to work on is greeting new people when they come to my home (mainly new adult men, they scare me). I am housebroken. I get along with older small dogs. I also get along with laidback cats.\n\nI would am apartment friendly. I need an owner willing to work with how I meet new people in a home. I am great in public. If you are looking for a laid back, homebody that is super duper grateful to be alive, please look no further!!!To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Cats have been tested and confirmed negative for Feline AIDS and Leukemia. Dogs have been tested for heartworm disease.\n\nOur shelter is located at 42 Deep River Rd in Sanford and is open Tues, Thurs, & Fri from 3pm - 7pm & Sat from 10-2pm (other times available by appointment). CARA's adoption process and online application can be found at\nhttp://www.cara-nc.org/info/adoption\n\nPlease call 919-774-9433, email adoptions@cara-nc.org, or visit www.cara-nc.org for information about this or other pets available for adoption.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me or any of my friends, please visit CARA to fill out an on-line application or e-mail us at adoptions@cara-nc.org.\n\nEvery animal that comes into the CARA program is here because one or more events occurred that led to this animal needing not only a home, but a person or family to love and protect them. Each animal has been loved and cared for by a small and determined group of people who want nothing more than to know each animal is safe for the rest of his or her life. Thank you for looking to adopt!",

NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in except between 12-3PM and near the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4473527.\n\nJack was recently found as a stray and brought into the shelter by a good samaritan. He was adopted shortly after but was brought back by the adopter. Jack has some issues that need to be addressed. He can be calm and easy and walks on a leash easily. He likes treats and is okay when you pet him but there are certain parts of his body that he doesn't like petted. He doesn't like his belly petted and if Jack thinks he's going to be picked up, he immediately tells you he doesn't like that. If he's laying down and someone tries to move him, he doesn't like that either.\n\nJack didn't like the other small dog that was in the home so he would be better as an only dog. Also, because of his behavior and history, he cannot be around small children. Jack needs behavior training to learn his manners. He also needs a patient adopter that understands his behavior traits and what he does and doesn't like. If you can work with Jack and understand his behavior traits, come and meet him today.\n\nThis is Jack's second time back at the shelter due to his bite history. Jack ieeds an experienced owner who understands the JRT breed and can help Jack on his training. Are you interested in helping Jack and want to foster or adopt him? Call the shelter today!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4473527.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Spud is a 5 year old catahoula mix. This sweet guy came to Wags and Wiggles a few months ago after losing his family in the south. Spud comes with a strict set of training rules, has received extensive training at a local training facility, and he cannot handle a family that does not understand and commit to his leadership needs. He does not belong on a couch or human bed, a floor is where he will find comfort. Spud is affectionate but cannot handle severe affection to his face; he prefers to be pet. Only serious applicants may apply for this great gent.\n\nA family without children and cats may apply.\n\n*\nDogs are adopting out quickly. Please know we are following covid-19 guidelines by practicing safe social distancing and other safe measures at the time of adoption. Our dogs are only shown to approved applicants at time of adoption outside.*\nAs with all our dogs we will require proof of a obedience course as we feel it is very important for the new family regardless of previous dog training experience to complete a training class soon after adoption to not only establish basic obedience but to bond with your new dog as well as socialize it. Many trainers have resumed training including outdoor classes.\n\n*\nIf interested in this pup please fill out an application on our website wagsnwiggles.org Please be sure all members of your family are on board with adopting a new family and you are ready to adopt NOW. A volunteer will be in touch to discuss you your application and the dog to determine if a good match. Your references, including your vet will be called. A virtual home visit done and finally a meet and greet and adoption if all are in agreement. Adopt fee is $425 for adults, $475 for dogs under 1 yr. which includes core vaccines, dewormed, current on flea/tick and heartworm preventatives, microchip, health certificate, heart worm/lyme test if over 6 months and spayed or neutered. Any questions please email wags.n.wiggles.rescue@gmail.com\n1/31/21 2:42 PM",

He's ready and willing to start over in a new home where he will be loved forever.\n\nPrecious Puffy is an 8 year old Poodle who is fully vaccinated, microchipped and neutered. At times, he can be somewhat dog selective and will flourish in an adults only home. Please call Bobbi at 917-213-9840 if you are interested in meeting this puffy pup.\n\nPuffy is currently at our Atlas (Queens) location.

            "description": "Our handsome boy Drake is a 4 year old Rottweiler/ Doberman mixed breed! He came to us from a shelter partner in Georgia in October 2020. He has lots of energy, so tons of activity is exactly what he's looking for! He would love an active owner(s) that can take him for long walks or hikes! He is very strong so he will need training on the leash because he pulls! He can be a bit overwhelming for small children, so a home with older children (preferably over the age of 15) or just adults is preferred. He is a very smart boy that loves to learn! He knows basic commands, such as sit and stay. He loves treats and is very food motivated! He seems to have missed early socialization with dogs when he was a puppy, so he would really prefer to be your only pet! He is very loyal and loving, making him the perfect dog for someone who lives alone or wants a great companion! \n\n\nIf interested in fostering or adopting Drake, please submit an online adoption application! Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment. After we receive and review your application, we will contact you to schedule with us! Thank you!",

Hugh loves to cuddle with his people and when he is comfortable he will roll over for belly scratches. Hugh enjoys lesurly strolls, and is never in a rush to get any where. He does like going for car rides and is the perfect shotgun rider. \nHe knows his sit, down, and shake command and is eager to learn more. Hugh loves playing with toys and that's when his puppy side comes out. His favorite toy is a stuffed hedgehog that he tosses into the air and pounces on!\n\nHugh would love to be the only dog in the home, he is single and loving it! He would also do best with an adult only family.",

What we know so far about this older gal is that she enjoys her walks and car rides and when you enter her run she likes to remain close to you. At times so much so that she \"hugs\" your leg to keep you from leaving. She enjoys lounging outside in the sun and laying on soft beds. Navee is a beautiful little older gal who will bring someone snuggles and a smile for all seasons.\nMight you be her sunshine to light up her life?",

In the short time she's come into her foster home, she has done a lot of work to try to get to a place of the happy little dog that lives buried in her broken heart.\n\nShe's been let down by humans in the past and isn't quick to trust. Muffin will need to go to a home with an experienced dog owner who is ready to devote the time and energy it will require to keep Muffin progressing through her anxiety. She will not do well in a home with other dogs or small children. She hasn't been tested with cats. She is very scared of a leash and collar/harness so a fence is a must if outdoor potty breaks are desired, otherwise she is good using pee pads although not 100% accurate. She does not currently potty outdoors and this will take a lot of time and secured training if ever achievable. She loves her people once she's reassured they aren't going to hurt her, but can react if startled and her anxiety takes over.\n\nMuffin does resource guard her blankets, bedding and occasionally toys. Extra precaution needs to be addressed while she's nesting and comfortable. She does initiate cuddles on her terms and has a lot of love inside of her. Muffin can be very playful and loves her toys, she's a great sleeper and deserves a cozy spot next to her human. If you're interested in learning more about Muffin, please fill out an application and I'd be happy to talk your ear off about this quirky beautiful soul that needs a second chance.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

Kirstie was found as a stray but must have been someone's pet at one time. She is great with people and does well with other dogs. We don't know about cats. The foster she is at has only dogs. Kirstie is healthy and will be brought up to date on all her shots and be microchipped. She was spayed and had a dental at the end of October. She likes car rides and head rubs! She is ready to go to her new home!\n\nKirstie is available for a local TN adoption.  Her adoption donation is $150. She is a wonderful senior and deserves her golden years as someone's precious girl!\n\n*Unless stated otherwise, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, on flea/tick product and heart worm prevention medicine (if older than 5 months) and micro chipped prior to adoption.\n\n*Please note that while we do our best to accurately state the breed or breed mix of a dog, we often have very limited information to draw from. Identifying the breed without pedigrees and information on heritage can be very challenging!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please go to www.angelsamongusanimalrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Thank you!\n\nMassachusett's Residents: Effective September 28, 2017 a Quarantine Fee of $120 will be required  (in addition to the adoption fee) to adopt a dog that has been Quarantined. Massachusetts mandates that all dogs entering MA shall be quarantined for 48 hours in a state approved facility.",

            "description": "Moses is a big, handsome cuddle bug who would love to be your one and only dog (and NO cats!). He wants a person all to himself, and would thrive in a household with no other pets. He will bond with his person or people and his joy in loving you and being loved by you will fill your heart and his. He\u2019s smart and funny and gets the zoomies once in a while, so he would do great in a yard with a little room to zoom and a high fence. He also does great on car rides and loves to go on walks, but he is a big guy (75+) and is still working on basic commands and leash manners. Although he\u2019s six years old (we think), he has the attitude and sense of adventure of a dog half his age. And when you\u2019re ready for some downtime on the couch, he couldn\u2019t be happier to snuggle up and join you. He only barks when he has a reason to bark, and he\u2019s housebroken. He can be a little fearful in new environments and when he hears loud noises or is startled and might run and hide, but as long as you are patient with him at first, you will be rewarded with his full trust.\nApply today at www.realrottweilerrescue.com \n\nPlease note: The prospective owner must agree to a screening process that includes an application and the signing of an adoption contract.\n\nOur goal is to find the best match for our dogs and their new families, so that everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nWe prefer homes who want to go to an obedience class. Training strengthens the bond and trust that you have with your dog, and it's fun, for both of you! Dogs like to think and to be mentally challenged. The training you do together will be an investment in the future. \n\nWe will try to respond within 24-48 hours, but please be patient as we are volunteer based. We all have full time jobs and are busy with other rescue matters.\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Meet Bo!\u00a0\n\nBo is a very special boy looking for a very special family to love him as much as he loves his humans!\u00a0\n\nBo was a typical dog before one random morning he woke up and could not use his back legs. He had 2 severe herniated disks that came on very suddenly. His previous owners were amazing and got him the surgery he needed to correct them but unfortunately, in Bo\u2019s case the surgery did not take.\u00a0 This left him paralyzed in his back end. He has had extensive therapy with both his previous owners and Zoe\u2019s House. The therapist he currently sees says that he will continue to benefit from acupuncture therapy twice a month for the rest of his life. His previous owners were devastated having to surrender him but they had health issues of their own. They knew this sweet boy deserved the best in life.\u00a0 Even if it meant they couldn't be the ones to provide it.\u00a0\n\nBo\u2019s condition does not stop him from living his best life and loving everyone he meets! He has adapted to getting around and uses his front legs to move around the house and boy is he fast! He also has an indoor cart he can use (which isn\u2019t his favorite) and an outdoor cart which he absolutely loves!! Bo loves being around people. He does have separation anxiety but it is being managed well with medication. Due to this he would do well in a home where someone is home most of the time.\n\nBo currently lives with his foster families fur children (2 dogs and a cat) and human children aged 2 and 6. He gets along well with everyone. If a dog is hyper/active he needs slower introductions.\u00a0\n\nBo does wear diapers or a belly band, for bathroom purposes, but he does have a routine with defecation so his foster mom is now able to get him outside to do \u201c#2\u201d most of the time.\u00a0\n\nPlease don\u2019t let Bo\u2019s condition turn you away from this sweet sweet boy!! He would do well in many different homes as long as he is given love and attention! We can also answer any questions you have if you are considering adopting this amazing boy! Due to his medical condition we are requiring children ages 6 and older.\u00a0\n\nPlease visit www.zoeshouserescue.com to complete an application.",

His teeth were also affected. He came into a home that me, my husband, our small dog, and our big dog shared. We are now trying to rehome Bruno because we feel he needs a home with  kids over the age of 12 and our daughter is only 3 years old. Bruno is a sweet boy who would do great in calm environment and with someone that has the time to love on him.  This cutie doesn't like being crated but he does great in a room by himself when we are not home. Bruno loves being outside on sunny days. He hates rain and being outside when it\u2019s dark. Bruno has lived with 2 other dogs and has done great with them so we think he will most likely do good with other dogs even though he has only interacted with the dogs he has lived with. \nAfter slipping on a tile floor in 2017, he had knee capsule repair surgery.  He seems fully stable since then, but cannot take walks due to his amputation. \nPlease consider adding Bruno to your family, he is a sweet boy who deserves to be loved and in an environment that makes him feel at ease. \n\nIf interested in Bruno please email at: kristenp44@live.com",

GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD ADOPTION APPLICATION GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD REQUIRES ONGOING PROPER VETERINARY CARE FOR ALL ANIMALS ADOPTED TO INCLUDE HEARTWORM MEDICATIONS, FLEA MEDICATIONS, AND YEARLY VACCINATIONS. GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $250. THESE FEES HELP KEEP THE RESCUE GOING. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

            "description": "Mylo requires a countryside home away from strange dogs and where he has lots of room to run around, with an experienced owner.\n\nHi there, my name is Mylo. I am 3 year old old labrador retriever cross.  I was born on March 20, 2017. I was found with my mom and siblings in an abandoned building in Tehran. The city officials were going to take us away and \"dispose\" of us. The ruling clerics in Iran consider dogs impure and it is even illegal to own a dog here. Thankfully a shelter here found out about us and stepped in to save us.\n\nI had found a home here in Canada, but due to dog aggression issues my adopter has made the heartbreaking decision that she can't keep me. She thinks it is because of fear, since once I feel safe around another dog, I will play with them all day.\n\nWhy should you bring me home, you ask? Well, I am one of the most affectionate cuddlebugs you will ever meet! I'm a lap dog trapped in a big dog's body. I'd love to sleep on the bed or snuggle on the couch with you, if you'd let me (I only come up when invited). I'm also super smart and know a lot of tricks, and respect the boundaries that my family has set in place. Overall, I can be quite lazy and am happy to sleep the day away. That being said, I'm also happy to be your hiking partner, or simply go for car rides. I just want to be around you. \n\nI currently live with a cat but sometimes my instincts get the best of me and I try to chase it. So it's probably best if I live in a house without. I will also bark to warn you about the scary mailman, but will quiet down if you tell me to. I can also be a fussy eater (like most Salukis) and mainly like to munch on meat or raw food. On the rare occasion I will touch dry kibble, but only if it's mixed in with some tasty meat. That being said, my love of raw food can be a great training motivator! Reward me with hot dogs or chicken and you will have my full attention.\n\nI'd be best off on a larger property out of the city where I don't have to encounter strange dogs all the time, since right now I have to wear a muzzle and harness on walks. When another dog comes in to my personal space, I can get quite aggressive initially until I know that I am safe. My family has made some progress on walks by distracting me with treats, but I still have a long way to go.\n\nMy unpredictable lunging and strength has caused sprained wrists and ankles, and my family is finding it harder and harder to manage me on walks. I absolutely HATE my muzzle and try to get it off by rubbing on rocks or bushes, so an experienced owner who knows how to work through these issues with me so that I don't require a muzzle is a must.\n\nMy current family says that I am a grateful, gentle soul. They also say I am athletic and graceful when I get the chance to run around in the forest off leash with no distractions or worries, and that my new owner will feel like they've won the rescue lottery as long as they are prepared to work with me through my aggression.\n\nplease see our adoption guidlines at www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca\n\ni am neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. My adoption fee is $500.",

            "description": "Imagine if you spent over four months living somewhere that truly stressed you out. Imagine if you spent at least four months in a row feeling anxious and fearful regardless of how much you were loved by others. This is adoptable Iris's reality. At the end of the day, the kenneling environment is very stressful to Iris; we cannot change that for her. We work hard to provide her with enrichment and extra time outside, but she still returns to her kennel. \n\nIris arrived in mid-September. The anxiety she has developed from living for over four months in the shelter environment has created kennel stress. Iris's kennel stress has led to her being fearful and reactive sometimes when meeting new people, which leads to not many people applying for her, which lengthens her stay inside of the kennel, which only furthers her anxiety. Iris will need more than one visit to acclimate to you. Trust us when we say that once she knows you are a friend, she is the most loyal and loving companion. \n\nIris would also be totally ideal for adults only who love training; someone who loves doing nose work, and/or spending their time at a dog training/agility club. She has an incredible ball drive, scent drive and work drive. Iris needs someone who is willing to give her time to decompress once she is home. \n\nIris will take extra time and effort, but once she trusts you, she will do anything that you ask. She is such a great dog and has so much potential. She adores our kennel staff and volunteers and can absolutely develop that relationship with you. We could see her being the best hiking buddy and loving outdoorsy stuff.\n\nIris was surrendered to the shelter due to no fault of her own. Her previous owner loved her very much but was unable to continue to care for her. She used to live with a small dog in her previous home. Since Iris's stress levels have been increasing, her dog interactions have not been going as well as before. It is possible that down the road, Iris could live with another dog, but at this point she will need to be the only animal in the home. When she is outside, she focuses well on her handler and re-directs from other dogs; especially if there is a tennis ball in her sight!\n\nIris is a very intelligent girl. She knows how to sit, come, stay, leave it and \"let's go\". \"Let's go\" is the command that her previous owners said to re-direct her attention, go for a walk, or leave a room. She really listens beautifully.\n\nYelling in the home is something Iris does not like; she becomes uncomfortable. She sometimes resource guards her toys but will give them up for treats or another tennis ball. Teaching her to share would be great! When meeting new people, she does best with a very slow introduction. She has lunged before when she is afraid and we want to set her up for success in the future.\n\nShe is about five years old and is spayed. Please call (219) 872-4499 and ask to speak to Karen if you are interested in Iris.",

He does well with children but we recommend his home not have kids under 5 due to his exuberance! His home should have a 6' fence. \n\nMarty was heartworm positive and his activity had to be kept to a minimum.

She waited and waited for her owner to come looking for her, but sadly that never happened. No worries Danna, we\u2019re happy to have you with us and find you a brand new, loving home! This little girl is crazy fun and has a ton of energy! She\u2019s active, athletic, and such a pack of muscle that she\u2019ll guilt you into getting up and getting active! Danna has definite \u201cBoxer energy\u201d and will need a lot of exercise to keep her happy and her owner sane. ? She plays well with other dogs that can meet her activity level. She\u2019s great with people, although she can play pretty rough, so her best fit would be in a home with teenagers or older. Danna is smart, stubborn, and very food motivated\u2026 she\u2019ll do anything for a cookie \u2013 but who wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019s still learning the rules, but she does like to please and catches on quickly. She appears to be housebroken as she doesn\u2019t have accidents in her kennel, but we\u2019re not 100% sure. We do believe if she isn\u2019t, it won\u2019t take long to train her. She does well on a leash after the initial excitement of the adventure subsides, but at first pulls pretty hard \u2013 and did we mention she\u2019s crazy strong?! Danna loves to give kisses and will give a quick run-by smooch without any notice. If this adorable girl sounds like she needs to be part of your life, please fill out an application to get the process started.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

DOB: 7/13/16 Approx Weight: 55 Lbs\nAdoption Fee: $175 includes a 2 week trial to ensure everyone's happiness!\nBuddy Rich joined Furry Kids' after landing in a rural shelter. He was heartworm positive and had a fatty tumor on his leg. He spent his entire summer going through heartworm treatment (bummer right?) but now he is ready to start enjoying his new life! His second chance!\nBuddy is a sweetie pie, has an excellent pouty lip when he wants to use it, and will require a fenced yard to safely play and potty. No apartments please.\nI have been neutered, vaccinated, heartworm tested positive and treated for heartworms, wormed and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting me, please complete the adoption application located at www.furrykidsrefuge.org/adoptadog and a dedicated volunteer will get back to you as soon as possible.\nFurry Kids' Refuge is in need of good quality dog and puppy food with meat as the first ingredient. You can drop off donations at our weekly adoption events at the Lee's Summit Petco (1860 NW Chipman Road, Lee's Summit, MO), Saturdays only from Noon to 4:00 p.m. Donations are tax deductible as allowed by law.\nWould you like to foster a Furry Kid? Furry Kids' Refuge will supply the food & vet care while you supply the basic house rules & love.......win-win for all!! Just visit our website http://www.furrykidsrefuge.org/category/fostering/ for more information. Thanks for your support!",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nHi, My name is Ursa! I'm a loyal Sheprador who loves chasing bugs outside and long walks around the neighborhood. I'm a little nervous around new people, so I may take some time to warm up to you and your new home, but once I know you're my friend, I love to play. Hide and seek is one of my favorite games in the house. I'm very smart and know quite a few tricks, but might need a little more work on how to properly meet strangers who come to the house so that I don't seem so intimidating to new people. I'm fully potty trained and passed an obedience class when I was a little younger (I'm a little over 2 now)! If I get really excited, I like to run zoomies, so it's a good idea for me to have a large yard where I can run and lay in the grass when there is good weather. I've been raised with a small person, but since I get anxiety about new things and take some warming up, it might be best if there are only adults in my new home. I like most other animals I've met (though I will chase birds and squirrels), but please give me a chance to meet your pet first, since some dogs scare me. I don't usually hang out at dog parks since I'd rather be with my people where I'm more comfortable, but if I'm on a leash or in the yard, I love a good chase! I would love to find my forever home with someone who can work with me on my fear and give me lots of walks and snuggles. I get scared sometimes, but I am such a good girl and I love to learn and earn treats! I'm hoping I can find a loving family or person who can give me the love and attention I need.

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet them.\n\nBear and Bandit are not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nBear is a large Akita mix and Bandit is the Dachshund mix.\n\nAge: They are both about 9 years old.\nWeight: Bear is 68lbs (should lose some!) and Bandit is 13lbs\nHousebroken: Bear is housebroken. Bandit marks inside the house, but does well with a belly band. He was recently neutered so we are hopeful his marking habit will improve.\nCrate trained: They have each done well with their crate-training so far.\nDog sociability: Friendly! They enjoy each other's company and have done well with other dogs. Bear may pull on walks if he sees another dog he wants to meet.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Bear and Bandit are pretty adaptable to most home environments but would prefer to not live in a high-rise/elevator building.\n\nMeet Bear and Bandit, our favorite dynamic duo! These bonded brothers will fill your days with lots of cuddles and laughs. Both boys are extremely affectionate, friendly, and easy-going. They are very well-behaved when meeting new people and also enjoy making new dog friends. Bandit is happiest when he's snuggled up on your lap and Bear is happiest when he's getting head scratches. They love to lounge, but also enjoy long walks around the neighborhood. These boys make sweetest and silliest pair and they have lots of love to give!\n\nBear and Bandit's adoption fees are sponsored, due to a generous donation. Bear and Bandit are both neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Bear has hip dyslpasia and will benefit from weight loss and joint supplements.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Please submit an application and we will link you up for an intro.\n\nOreo is eligible for a foster-to-adopt to ensure a perfect fit!\n\nAge: ~3.5 years\nWeight: ~58lbs.\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Does very well in her crate when she is left alone.\nDog sociability: Oreo is leash frustrated and may bark and lunge when she sees another dog on leash, however she has successfully had dog pals after slow intros\nCat sociability: Not a match\nKid compatibility: Not a match\nIdeal living situation: Oreo prefers a quieter neighborhood. She's not a match for a high-rise/elevator building.\n\nOreo wakes up every morning ready to play! She loves tug, fetch, and ripping up stuff, cardboard boxes are a fave! She also loves to chew so keep the nylabones handy! In the warm months, her best times are spent outdoors, hanging in the backyard or going for hikes in the woods or long strolls through the neighborhood. She loves all people and is working really hard to improve her dog meeting skills. Oreo does not want to share her home with another dog, but has several dog friends. She comes on pretty strong at first, but settles. With a slow intro, she has successfully been able to walk with other dogs and have play dates off leash. While on walks, she has met several neighborhood dogs and enjoys running alongside their fences to play with them. She is super smart and eager to please. She loves to do any sort of training exercise where treats are involved and is working on clicker training. She loves to be with her people and will make herself at home on your lap!\n\nOreo's adoption fee is sponsored thanks to a generous donor! She is spayed, vaccinated, heartworm tested and microchipped.\n\nDue to COVID, we are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application.",

He would likely do well with a dog pal in his home. \n\nRoller Blades is ready to roll his way right into your heart! This guy is sweet, soft, and always ready to PLAY. He is a young guy who is is still learning 'how to dog' and is going to benefit from an adopter that can help show him the way! He can be a little unsure when meeting new people and would like for the fridge to always be stocked with his favorite deli meats to help win over his affection with strangers. He's an active guy that has enjoyed going for runs and stopping to meet other dog friends along the way. He has done great with the dog pals in his current foster and would likely love a dog pal in his forever home!\n\nRoller Blades' adoption fee is sponsored thanks to a generous donor!

We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  We do not have a shelter, and are a foster-home based organization.  Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.  You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt.",

Champ will do best as an only pet in an adult only home, where he can be the only, big spoiled baby around! Champ is basically a toddler in dog form. He LOVES toys and will insist on carrying them everywhere with him, even when he goes for a walk. Champ also loves getting outside and rolling in the grass or even better, rolling in the mud! He's a big playful goofball, but Champ is also used to living in a home and knows his indoor dog manners. He's most happy when he's sleeping on the comfiest bed he can find or giving lots of kisses to his people.This guy is always ready for fun and always has a big smile on his face. Contact us to set up a meeting at ARF and see that smile for yourself!\n\n-----\nIMPORTANT: To protect the health of our staff and volunteers, ARF is currently conducting adoptions by appointment only.

            "description": "Hello,\n\nMy name is Spike. I am a young (1-3 year old) 50 pound pit mix.\n\nI have been lucky enough to go into foster a home!  I am definitely a puppy at heart! I can be a little over the top but I love training and learning new things. My foster family has been working to teach me to stay focused and not be so excitable. I am making big strides with them. Since I can be a little much at times, if there are any kids in your home I would do best with 13 and above.\n\nI am highly food motivated. Food grabs my intention instantly! I have been working on being patient and waiting for my food. I tend to gulp my food down real fast so my foster family got me a slow feeder to slow that down and savor the flavor. My foster family says I am doing so much better. I also will sit and take treats (or fruit) nicely when offered.\n\nThere are no pets in my foster home but I seem to like other dogs. I can be a little energetic when I meet new dogs. If you have another dog, we can do a meet and greet and see how we do together.\n\nWhen my foster family leaves the house, I am crated. I do well in my crate. I go in with no issues and relax fast. Sometimes I even go in there to rest throughout the day...especially when the door is closed to the office(that\u2019s where they keep my dog bed). When time for bed, I will put myself to bed in my crate. I do well sleeping in my there all night.\n\nI love pretty much all toys and bones. I will give them up if asked. I can be a hard chewer and have destroyed a few toys so far. I can\u2019t help having fun with them. I really enjoy a kong with peanut butter in it. My foster family says that keeps me occupied for a while. They got me a ball with plastic spikes on it. I do play with it but it\u2019s not really a favorite of mine. Tug of war with a rope toy is one of my more favorite games to play.\n\nI am doing much better with potty training. We needed some time to figure each other out. It\u2019s not perfect yet but I am greatly improving each day. I will need someone with a little time and patience til we learn together what works best in your home.\n\nI have gone on a few car rides so far. My foster family has a big SUV and I have needed a little coaxing to get into it. Once I am in, I am calm and sit back and enjoy the ride\n \nI have met a few guests. That has been really fun for me. I do tend to get a little excited and want to greet everyone with a big hug. I am working on keeping my feet on the floor when guests come over. I am getting pretty good at it.\n\nI tend to want to set the pace for walking... I like moving a little faster. Fast walking and the occasional jog has been fun for me. I\u2019m working on healing and walking at a slower pace. I just can\u2019t wait to get going.\n\nI have learned sit and leave it really well. I love to hear the excitement in my foster parents\u2019 voices when I do it right. Wait, stay, down, all down, potty, me first(through doors), and come I am getting pretty good at...hoping to perfect them real soon. I\u2019d love to learn more and continue training with you in your home.\n\nIf you think we could be a good match and you are over 21 years old, send in an application for me at k9stray.com. My friends at K9 will be in touch.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\n~Spike",

He loves to trot around the yard and will lounge around on the couch, and he absolutely loves a good bone. He is good with other dogs, after a proper introduction, but due to his size and his current lack of training, we would recommend no children in the home. He seems very focused on cats, so we are hoping to find a cat-free home.\nNiko has just completed heartworm treatment, so he's working on building his stamina and endurance back up. He will be retested in June and if he's positive, we will cover the cost of continued treatment.\nIf you are interested in giving Niko a forever home, please submit an application on our website, www.prodogsohio.org/adoptables. He's been neutered, fully vaccinated, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $300.\nNiko is being fostered in the Columbus, OH area.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe appreciate your support, in order to help us continue to rescue dogs! Donations can be made via our PayPal account - info@prodogsohio.org.\nYou must be willing to commute to the location that the pet is being fostered in order to be eligible to adopt. We do not ship our pets. We also require that you personally bring the pet back to us should the adoption not work out.\nWe do NOT negotiate adoption fees. All money goes to support our rescue operation. We are 100% volunteered based.\nWe require your current dog(s) to be current on vaccines and heartworm prevention.\nApply online at www.prodogsohio.org, under the Adoptables tab.\nDue to the volume of apps and inquiries, we may not be able to respond to everyone. 1/30/21 12:48 PM",

Theorem is one of our Classic Barkers, meaning he has been patiently awaiting his home for over a year. He was originally rescued from an abusive owner. He and a number of other dogs were kept outside in a dirty junk yard in Mexico until fate intervened. Theorem has always gotten along with other dogs and people alike, but had some neck and collar sensitivity that made him unsuitable for an inexperienced home or one with children. Theorem went into foster mid-July and he is doing incredibly well! Theorem recently had surgery to remove some rotting teeth, and it's like he has a brand new personality! Here is what his foster family has to say:\n\n\"\"Theo is a big, handsome, funny, sweetheart who is SO excited to show you all his new smile! He is feeling better every day since his big dental surgery (8 days ago) and we are noticing surprising positive changes in his behaviors that we think must have been related to his pain from his teeth. He used to be slightly unpredictable when we would touch his face and body - he would ask for pets but then might growl and we didn't know why. That is all gone now... he loves being pet by his foster pawrents ALL the time. He is already happier overall, and more chill than before his surgery. His breath smells good now, and don't worry, he still has lots of top and back teeth so he can eat solid foods soon. We are so sorry for all Theo had to go through in the past, but we are SO excited for him to hopefully find his fur-ever humans now that we can fully explain his personality, which is: He is loving, loyal, and fun! He loves walks, adventures, car rides, treats, his toys, his bed, rolling in the grass, being pet by his humans, cuddling in between humans legs, and finding the best backscratching bushes in the neighborhood. He can sometimes get territorial with his foster sister (TBL alum Koda) and we have to correct him. He would like an owner who is experienced with dogs and is able to provide consistent and positive reinforcement so he can continue to become the best dog he can be!\"\"\n\nTheorem is about 7 and a half years old (estimated DOB March 2013) and a great medium size of about 50 pounds. He is housebroken, crate trained, walks great on leash, enjoys playing with squeaky toys, going for runs, laying in his dog bed, and eating treats.\n\nIf you'd like to meet this pup, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

            "description": "Meet Platt! He is about 2 years old and is a Lab mix, likely with a couple other breeds. He is sweet and his butt wiggles in glee whenever he sees his foster mom. He loves to cuddle with his family but isn't so sure when visitors come over so would prefer a family where there aren't a lot of people coming in and out. He likes to give kisses and revels in attention. Platt is fostered with a Great Dane and Chihuahua. He seems to prefer the Great Dane and other big dogs over small dogs. Sometimes he can play a little rough and needs reminders to tone it down. He doesn't always like to share so has to be fed separate from his foster siblings. He also can be over enthusiastic on leash when he sees strange dogs and people and needs a dog experienced family that will continue to work on his socialization. He has been fine with cats until they run and then he eagerly gives chase. Platt loves anything with stuffing and is still figuring out the difference between stuffed toys and beds and pillows; he thinks it's his mission to pull the stuffing out of them all. Platt fell into some bad luck before Labs and More. He was hit by a car and arrived at our rescue with a broken hip. He will now be spending the next couple of months recovering from surgery and will be available in mid Feburary to start meeting families. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations.

So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

This sweet boy completely won over the entire vet staff with his wonderful demeanor .\n\n30 more days of restricted activity and he will heartworm free ! Good food and good meds and this handsome boy is now up to 96 lbs, about 4 lbs less than his ideal weight, but at least his ribs aren't showing .\n\nIf you are looking for a gentle giant please check out Brody .\n\nBRODY is doing well in his foster home although becomes anxious when she is out of the room. He is so happy to be safe again he has a bit of separation anxiety, which we are working with to ease.\n\nSadly, after Brody's first vet visit we learned his heartworm infection is advanced and his heart is slight enlarged . He has started the initial part ( 30 days of Doxcycycline ) and will have his first injection in early December. His risk of a pulmonary embolism from a clot of dead heartworms is much higher due to the level of his infestation.\n\nASR does the conservative treatment of 3 injections to allow our HW+ dogs the best possible chance for a full recovery and we will be doing the same with Brody.\n\nFor any adopters interested in him he will need slow walks and very restricted activity while going through heartworm treatment . Overall this will be about 90 days since he has already started the initial part of the treatment\n\nPoor Brody found himself at an overcrowded shelter, not a good place for a Heartworm Positive dog......but when shelter workers sent out a plea for this good ole boy, we could not say no.\n\nOnce he has settled in we will start his heartworm treatment and help add some weight to his skin and bones frame.\n\nTonight this nice boy sleeps well on a soft bed with a full belly, thanks to wonderful volunteers .\n\nMore to come.\n\nTHANK YOU TUESDAY S. FOR YOUR SPONSORSHIP OF BRODY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER.\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com. Our adoption fee is $350.00.",

The human was tempted but respectfully declined the invitation for food and frolic due to the lack of room in the diminutive Chihuahua sized pool. Kiki has an amazing desire to please and keeps her attention fully on her human and comes joyfully running to you when called.",

            "description": "2-year-old Odie maybe short of stature but he has a big smile and a lot of people-pleasing personality. He showed his depth of the canine spirit as he quickly adapted to his new surroundings at the Humane Society. Odie set the all-time record for a speedy interaction as he joined the photographer for the bark park session less than 15 minutes after he first arrived. Odie interacts warmly with kids of all ages and loves to roll over and make his tummy available for a welcomed tummy rub. Like his role model, Odie would probably enjoy the opportunity do his best to out-think and out-wit a feline friend.",

The vet estimates that she is between one and two years old. While we don't know anything of Zira's past, it is evident that she was not given the opportunity to learn what should be expected from a furry family member. This means she will need a home with leadership, structure, and balance. Zira will without a doubt make for a loving companion and an ideal adventure partner, but her adopters will need to understand that in the beginning that can only come with the balance of setting rules and boundaries for this headstrong girl. Zira is currently working on learning her doggy manners to assist her in being set up for success in her new home, and we definitely think she is a fast learner!  She already knows sit, touch, place, and heel.   She is also working on high ten, sit pretty, and even push ups!!  \n\nIf you are up for a challenge or have questions and would like to chat about Zira, send us an email to adopt@crcpa.org or submit an online application on our website. **Zira will require a fenced in yard **",

            "description": "Bernie is a sweet young boy who is guessed to be a bully mix of some sort, possibly pitbull or an American bulldog mixed breed. He is 65lbs and can be a big lovey affectionate boy once you get to know him. He loves to give hugs and kisses. While he shares a foster home with other dogs, Bernie prefers to be the only dog in the home. With that we are looking for a quiet home with no children, no other dogs, and no cats for this big guy. He would also do best in a home that isn't too busy (so no apartments or city life for him). If you are looking for a nice, big, calm boy to hangout with and love then this is your guy! If you would like to meet and potentially adopt Bernie please submit an application below. \n\nAdoption Application Link: https://airtable.com/shr305FuyR4v4JWQb\n\nWebsite Link: https://furrytalesrescue.wixsite.com/home\n\nFacebook Link: https://m.facebook.com/furrytalesanimalrescue/\n\nIf you are seeing this dogs profile then we are still accepting applications for the dog.",

He's shy at first but quickly warms up. He loves to play but also okay with cuddling and napping. King is doing better with potty training and does well with a schedule. He's good with other dogs and doesn't seem to care much about cats. He loves to play fetch, although he hasn't quite learned to bring back the ball yet. King has a good appetite and is treat and toy motivated. He's doing much better on a leash and enjoys his walks or just running around in the backyard. King would be the perfect addition to any family willing to continue his training.",

I love to be with my humans, snuggle next to them, and drape myself over their lap. Nap time on the bed is my favorite cuddle time. I will need a home with fur siblings who are young and like to play, sometimes I can be a little rough when I play so a home with another dog who is my size and likes to play would be ideal. I do need supervision if I am with other dogs and we are all eating at the same time. I can get food aggressive, and will wander over to another food bowl if left unattended. I can also be a little jealous if another dog approaches while I am snuggled next to my human, although I am getting better about sharing affection. My current fur siblings are female and we get along just fine but I'm not a fan of having another boy dog in my space. Sometime before I got here I hurt my eye and I have lost vision in that one eye but it doesn't stop me at all. My previous family said I am a fence climber so I need a good, secure privacy fence to keep me from wandering. NO TODDLERS OR YOUNG CHILDREN. FEMALE DOG COMPANIONS ONLY. Franky's adoption fee is $375\n\nThank you for your support in our rescue efforts!If you are interested in any of our Boston Terriers or would like to be eligible to adopt a Boston Terrier through our rescue in the future, please fill out an application.

We would like to see them go to their forever home together but he could be adopted separately.  \n\nJack is very affectionate, loves to hike and walk and he loves treats. He is a quiet pup and loves to nap. He would be a wonderful companion to a young kid (age around 10-11).  He is very loyal and affectionate.\n\nHe gets along with other dogs but he keeps to himself and doesn't really play with other dogs.  He seems to prefer the company of human companions.\n\nHe is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and micro chipped.  He is in the process of getting house trained and doing well.\n\nIf you are interested in Jack, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerecue.org or contact us for more information.",

SEEKING DALLAS AREA FOSTER ONLY AT THIS TIME\n \n\nRamona\n\nRamona is a 10 month old Pug who is having some neurological symptoms and health concerns. Her previous owner to her to some cheap vet in Mexico to do surgery on her head, not sure why, and she was left with a HUGE scar. She has an issue with the ocular pressure in her left eye. In addition she has HORRENDOUS dual ear infections complete with blood and puss . Her neuro symptoms are that she spins and spins and spins. We are hoping it is a bad inner ear infection but if not our vet will refer her to our neurologist at MedVet. She heads to the vet tomorrow.\n\nThis sweet girl has endured so much in her short 10 months and we are so relieved to have her as a High Plains PAW dog to address concerns and make sure she gets the care she needs. \n\nShe's not going to be a \"cheap\" dog but she is 100% WORTH IT!

He is a little nervous in new situations, but comes around pretty quickly, then he's just a sweetheart who loves people & is good with other dogs! While Pilot like kids,, we think a home with older kids would be best at this time as he is still learning how to properly play. He would also do best in a quieter, low-traffic home. He'd also love a fenced yard because he LOVES to run around, but it is not required. Pilot loves car rides and doesn't mind be the \"co-pilot\" and is a huge fan of sleeping in bed with you. Pilot currently weighs about 45 pounds and so excited to find his forever family!\n\nIf you'd like to meet him, please fill out an adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org & ask for PILOT BAILEY!",

She was rescued from a Tucson shelter with her puppies who are all adopted now. Summer is a friendly, curious girl who loves going for walks, taking road trips, exploring new places, and finding the perfect spot in the sun to nap. She is a good combo of active and chill. Although she is good with other dogs, she mostly just tolerates them and would prefer to be the only queen in the castle, but she promises to be a loyal companion. No Cats, she chases and thinks it's snack time. She is housebroken, leash trained, likes car rides, knows sit, stay and come, and can easily learn more. She is easy to train, eager to please, and loves being outside, or by her owner's side. Summer is looking for a quiet home on the range with a large yard to roam, paths to stroll, and places to go.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n",

I'm a big boy who still thinks that I am puppy, so I am looking for an experienced large dog owner to go home with. I know sit, but am a jumpy boy who can't seem to sit still. I recently completed treatment for heartworm, so it is important that my new family continues heartworm prevention monthly. I would like to be the only pet in the home and would likely do best in a home with teens and adults only because I don't seem to know my size. If you have room in your heart and home for me, come meet me today!",

He is house trained, crate trained, and dog friendly! His excitable energy can make other dogs uncomfortable as he is pushy and thinks every dog likes him. Humble K9 will give 2 free lessons on handling Vincente when he is in high excitable energy mode. His adopter needs to be in charge, and patient to show him that not every dog loves him like he loves them. Vincente needs to have a home where he has an outlet for his energy, an outdoorsy person, and someone who will take him on daily walks, runs, or hikes. This happy boy is great with kids and people! He is the perfect boy for a home with an active lifestyle! Please give this energetic boy the chance to be your best friend!\n\nIf interested in adopting Vincent, kindly fill out the application found here:  \n\nhttps://www.ozzieandfriendsrescue.org/adoptions\n\nIn filling out this adoption application, I understand that Ozzie and Friends Rescue cannot guarantee that the dog applied for is yours to adopt upon completion of application. \n\nWe also want to disclaim that all dogs are rescued so we cannot 100% know the exact breed.\n\n",

My main goal every day is to snuggle as much as possible with my human friends. I'm not too fond of other animals, but I don't mind seeing other dogs on walks from a distance. I am house trained and will gladly go into my crate when I am asked. I always hear my foster parents talking about how perfect and well behaved I am. I hope to be a perfect addition to your family!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Gerald, please fill out an application at: https://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

Before coming to BDRR I was fostered in a home with Miss Brooklyn and we had a great time. \nI have great, laid back energy, very sweet, and I love belly rubs. I am good on the leash and will make a great walking partner. I do have food aggression and would be most appropriate for a family that does not have any other dogs. I am NOT GOOD WITH CATS OR CHICKENS. I enjoy our play time where we get to run around and play in the yard and take a dip in the pool. I am also very afraid of storms and will need you to help me feel safe when the bad weather comes.\n\nTruly a great companion!",

I was a stray but am now in a nice foster home where I\u2019m learning how to trust people again. I bonded to my female human foster moms very quickly but am learning how to trust males - I am currently enrolled in doggie training school where they say I am a very good boy with lots of potential! I have been on several social outings to restaurant patios and I\u2019m so large that everyone loves to pet me..I like it when they feed me chips off the table so I sit politely and wait :) I am very cuddly and would love to be a 'lap Pyr' or share the bed with you if you let me. If you think I\u2019m too big I\u2019ll prove you wrong. When I want to be petted I will give you the pyr paw but I\u2019ll never try to jump on you. I do well walking on a leash most of the time. Sometimes I try to pull to chase squirrels but I\u2019m working on this in school too. I have cat brothers in my foster home who I ignore most of the time but will chase on occasion, only if they started it first! I\u2019ve met dogs and like to play but it takes me time to adjust before I am comfortable enough letting loose. I will need an adopter committed to continuing my training and understands that I am still learning!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Now, instead of my tail between my legs, I can't stop wagging it. My mom tells me how she is so proud of me because I am so well-mannered in the house and am housebroken. I am also crate-trained but really prefer to be with my family. While I don't mind cats, I really prefer to stay away from other dogs. I absolutely LOVE fetch and could play it all day if you would let me. I take a little time to warm up to new people but I am looking for my forever home. Is it you?

OK, so this write-up on Rosie was so good that I borrowed it :) Here is her story:-Rosie was found as a stay on Oak Gardens Ave in Long Beach, MS. She stayed with a family while they tried to locate her owners but no one came forward. With Rosie being a senior the stairs at their apartment were just too much for Rosie and the family.-She is a senior estimated to be 8-10 years old (vet estimated at 6 years...we feel more like 8ish)\n-Good with dogs and cats-Heartworm negative-Up to date on all vaccinations. Thought to be spayed, will confirm.-Tolerates the clinic cat with total calmness-Has seen other dogs at the clinic and did not care...she passed her dog test with flying colors!-Needs a home (foster, forever or rescue) by Friday since her stray hold will be up and she will not have a good outcome at a local overcrowded shelter!-Not positive on house training. She pottied forever with me today so knowing if she is at the vet clinic is hard since she does not go out as often as a dog in a home would.-SWEETEST GIRL! I met her yesterday and went and took photos of her today. She will literally just lay her head on you and not want you to leave!-Does well in her kennel at the clinic.-On Carprofen for arthritis.-Missing a few little spots of hair due to skin condition but meds are healing her up quickly (skin scrape was negative). Rosie will be arriving at her Alabama foster home on Friday, October 16th. Please check back to see how she is doing 11/30 UPDATE: As you can tell by the updated pictures, Rosie has settled right into her foster home :) She has put on some much-needed weight and is looking and feeling much better and she is enjoying all of the fun of ranch life. We are still working out some medical issues and are awaiting the results of her bloodwork recheck today. We will update on that as soon as possible.",

He is a sweet and active boy and we LOVE him!\nFrom his previous owner:\n\n'Hello everyone. We recently adopted this beautiful 2-year-old pure breed Siberian Husky from a family of trainers and rehomers on craigslist. He is a great dog for someone who has the time and experience for a Husky. He is house trained, vaccinated, treated for heartworm, and chipped! I also have those vet records on hand. His name is 'Scar' which was given to him by previous owners due to his past trauma of a bullet wound in his right cheek. He is completely healthy and made a full recovery. Very energetic. I mean that. He requires a lot of attention.\n\nWhy am I rehoming? In our situation as young, on the go, people, it is the right thing to do. I want to make sure he is with an owner that can train and discipline him further which has experience with more 'headstrong' breeds. He is also good with other dogs and LOVES people. He requires discipline and a true Alpha. That is something I cannot do for him.'\n\nWe are seeking an adopter for him with husky or other working breed experience and plan to be active and do training/mental stimulation with this smart boy. A 6' fence is a must for him. He is selective with which dogs he likes at doggy daycare so will be best as an only dog.\nColt is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is $250.\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "Lily is a beautiful and smart girl, who will need a VERY specific home. Experience with the breed is very much preferred. She will need a home with no other animals, and children older than 12 years of age. Lily is on daily anxiety medication and will need to remain on them for the rest of her life. She will need an active home with a fenced yard for her to run as much as possible as well. She loves to play fetch and is treat motivated. We believe Lily was born in April of 2015.\n\nAll pets adopted from the Humane Society of Freeborn County will have age appropriate vaccinations, testing, alterations and micro chips included in their adoption fee! Fill out an app at www.freeborncountyhs.org. \n\nWe do allow home trials with our dogs or cats to approved applicants. This is how we make sure your new family member is the perfect fit. We ask that you allow at least a month for your new pet to adjust to their new home. They will need that time to decompress. During this time we will provide counseling to ensure a successful transition.\n\nPlease review the basic adoption requirements listed on our site before applying. We take finding the right homes for our critters very seriously as they deserve nothing but the best! Please allow a week for applications to be processed.\nIf listed as (Currently in Foster) - these pets are not at our facility but are in foster care homes. They are available for adoption. Meet and greets are available with approved applicants only. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send us an email at freeborncohumanesociety@gmail.com. Don't forget to check us out on Facebook!",

She is leashed trained, crate trained good with other dogs, can be left alone. Stormy is a really good dog. She currently likes to talk back and definitely voices her opinion. She surely acts like an adult dog who knows her way around with an adult mentality. Needs a confident and patient owner who will teach her That she is not allowed to talk back and she will do great in the household. I have not had any issues with her besides the normal of a new handler and needing to patient with her initially. Storm likes to police other dogs. Gets along with big and small dogs. Minds her own business and only physically plays with selective dogs.",

Our hearts break for her because we know her chances at getting a home aren't great due to her physical condition.  We have to try though and she deserves comfort, love and a real home as she ages.  Doesn't everyone? Ruby can be tough with other dogs but she's currently kenneled with a large male and doing ok. We just believe that small dogs and female dogs aren't a good idea for her attitude.",

Neptune came to his handlers when called and then oriented to lean against them. He will need a little training for his tendency to jump up sometimes and to softly mouth his handler. Unfortunately, as is customary of many white Dobermans, he has some visual deficiency; in other words, he can see, but not as well as he should. White Dobermans also tend to develop melanomas (skin cancers) as they age, so ideally they should have a vet exam at least every six months to be checked and treated, if necessary. Neptune is about 3 years old and he weighs 72 pounds.",

He was strapped to the back of a pickup and his video set social media on fire.  No one ever came to the animal shelter despite the list of possible adopters that signed up for him so we were asked to come and pick him up.  Ace is probably around 2 years and absolutely full of energy.  He is strong, doesn't seem to have any training and he has energy to burn.  He will certainly need an active owner to help satisfy those needs so he can be more relaxed at home.  Ace is smart and we think he's a willing learner but focus is something he will need to work on.  He will need patient leadership to show him how to navigate the world.  So far, Ace has been a doll with people and friendly with everyone but we haven't seen him around children.  His energy level may be better suited to an adult home anyway or one with teenage-aged kids.  Overall, Ace is a great dog but he does not get along with other dogs.  He is reactive on leash and though he has responded well to strong leadership, he will need continued work if he is to be walked in populated neighborhoods.

He was such a ball of energy that his shelter sent him to us with two types of medications intended to slightly sedate him. We have found him to be overly energetic only when he's anxious about his surroundings. Initially we thought Charlie might not be good with other dogs, as their presence seemed to overenergize him, but he seems to want to engage with them in a positive way. The animal shelter people found him to be compatible with a large playful female dog he was introduced to. Notes from Charlie's ex-owner indicated that he does not like cats though, and that may apply to any type of small critter. He was given up by his owner because of a minor bite he delivered to a child in the home around the time of the 4th of July fireworks, which they believe may have been the cause of his anxiety. He comes when called and seems to enjoy toys. We think he's a fun dog to be around!",

This beautiful girl is a happy and social girl.   She seems to love everyone she meets.   She is good with other dogs and loves to play so she does need to be in a home with another dog, a yard would definitely be a plus. She needs a home that can give her proper regular exercise and we think that she would make a great family dog.  Sunshine can be really strong when playing and can easily topple over a small child so it's best that she be in a home with kids over 13 years old. She is crate, house trained and is pretty calm in the home. She is still learning to walk on leash as she gets really excited and pulls a lot so does need some work on this. Overall Sunshine is an amazing girl!\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:\n1.       Visit www.dogswithoutborders.org\n2.

            "description": "\nThey call me Smokey....I am a neutered male Rottweiler mix about 3 yrs old and i weigh 66 lbs. I'm a very handsome boy, likely housebroken, well behaved and love spending time with my people. I'm a little head shy so I would be best suited in a home with no small children. I do like other dogs but I would prefer to meet my doggie housemate just to make sure we get along...stop in and see me soon....I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

He was found as a stray at 4 months old and has spent his entire life in a rural shelter where he didn't have opportunities to learn about living in the real world. He\u2019s currently enrolled in a board/train program near Sarasota, FL.  Mac's life skills have greatly improved, and he has had opportunities to adjust to life outside a shelter. He would do best in a home with a fenced yard (the boy LOVES to fetch) and, due to his size and exuberance, one free of small children. Mac and his adopter will benefit from continuing in his training, and will receive 6 months FREE ongoing support from the facility. The reward for this commitment would be one of the MOST LOVING, FUN dogs ever! \n\nVisit Mac\u2019s OWN Facebook Page: (https://www.facebook.com/110406950568871/posts/178083050467927/) to see his popularity with many followers and view many, many photos showing his AWESOMENESS!\n\nContact Info:  email highland726@gmail.com \nor\nComplete an Application at: www.hbpr.org\n",

She is right around 38 pounds. She is not believed to be completely blind and seems to have a little more vision outdoors. She loves toys and to cuddle on the couch. Victoria would do best in a calm household with another dog to help her build confidence in her environment. \n\nNote: Victoria went to an unknown home to have the above pictures taken. She quickly became completely comfortable in the backyard and downstairs. She never ran into walls and was able to navigate stairs. \n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.\n\n",

She is right around 38 pounds. She is not believed to be completely blind and seems to have a little more vision outdoors. She loves toys and to cuddle on the couch. Victoria would do best in a calm household with another dog to help her build confidence in her environment. \n\nNote: Victoria went to an unknown home to have the above pictures taken. She quickly became completely comfortable in the backyard and downstairs. She never ran into walls and was able to navigate stairs. \n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received.

            "description": "Hi, I'm Jimmy Chew! I'm a very sweet, soft, cute and quirky guy! They say I am probably a Bassett mixed with maybe Shepherd or Collie, but my bark is more Bassett-like. I have huge ears with a long, lowrider body. I also have a white undercoat and diaper, so I am as cute coming as I am going! I am approximately 4 years old and 50 pounds. I am house trained, but I am really not a fan of my crate. I am not destructive though, so I don't really need it.\n\nThe more comfortable I get, the more loving and playful I am. I can be a little mouthy when I play, but in a gentle way. I will bark a little when separated from you because I really like to be around my people. My favorite people are adults and older kids...the little ones don't understand my quirks (12-years-old and up).\n\nI can be picky about my dog friends. I've lived with a larger, female dog and we got along after slow introductions over time, but I really don't care for male dogs at all. I also don't like kitty cats. I'd be happy as a clam being an only pet. I pull a bit when walking on leash and get a little over-stimulated when I pass other dogs, people, or moving cars, so a fenced backyard would be really great for me. I love being outside!\n\nI know I'm a quirky guy in looks and personality, but that's what makes life interesting! I hope to find an adopter who will understand me and love me for me.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

As a transfer from a different group, we don't have much background info on Spike (except that he is not good with porcupines). Our guess at his age is young adult. He is a very mixed breed, with shepherd being the most common guess. Spike is very people friendly, but is somewhat dog selective. \n\nSpike would do better in a home without little children, and would prefer to be the only dog.  *** NO CATS ***\n\nInterested in adopting?  Find our adoption application and more at our website: www.mchsofmn.org\n\nADOPTION FEE at the shelter $180 (Cash or Check Only - Includes sales tax)\nPotential adopters are required to fill out an adoption application. Please note \u2013 it does take several days to process an adoption application and to determine approval status. Your patience is appreciated.",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\nAdoption Fee: $250.00 for both\n\n\nThis is a mother and daughter bonded pair. Momma Zoe is 14 years old, weighing 11 pounds and Jelly is 12 years old, weighing 8 pounds. They are very bonded and will not be separated. Both are very sweet and do not act their ages. These girls are spayed and up-to-date on their shots. They both will be having dentals in early November and then ready for their new furever home.\n \nMomma Zoe doesn't see as well as she used to but otherwise is a happy girl. She does get irritated when Jelly starts licking her eyes and mole tags. Jelly also likes to lick people--a llot! They like going outside but are mostly pee pad trained.\n \nThey are good with other small dogs as well as ignoring a cat in the foster home. They love to sleep with you or just take a nap as long as they can be with you. Jelly likes to play with toys and games including playing hard to get when its time to come in from outside. She also likes to go for walks.\n \nThey can not be in a home with small children. They both have some occasional coughing due to collapsing tracheas which is being monitored. They definitely do not like taking medicine.\n \nThey are enjoying life in Bristow, VA until their forever family picks them up!\n\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

There loss is our gain. \n\nHazel we think is 8 months to a year old,  spayed female who has \ntons of energy. Due to her age she has alot to learn but is willing to do it in stride. She is very food motivated so training will be a breeze and a asset to her growth. She has learn to sit all on her own. She could use some leash training manners but has done remarkably well with what she has learned so far. As we have been working with Hazel things make her fearful and sometimes overstimulated. She is very insecure when it comes to meeting dogs so we think she would do best in a home with no other dogs. Cats are unknown at this time.  Kiddos in the home should be older. Hazel is working with a local trainer on her insecurities but will need someone strong willed to continue this with her. \n\nIf you wish to meet Hazel you must have an approved application with us. Once your application has been approved we can then set up a meet and greet between you, your family, and Hazel. All questions can be directed to our email ( office@horseheadscommunityanimalshelter.com) or by phone ( 607-739-3945).",

He was placed as a foster with a neighbor who became a dear friend. I walked him and engaged with him daily until last year when we were approached by the mother of a college girl who wanted her daughter to have a companion that could protect her. We all thought it would be a perfect world for him but as a classic college sophomore she began to neglect Buster. Buster was placed with an inappropriate family and now he's back at DAS A# 0903632. \n\nNOTE: He is a very specific needs dog: NO cats, high fence and no young children, they make him nervous. He NEEDS: one or two adults who are active and can exercise him daily, ideally work from home or come and go often and can keep him on a good regimen. A home with a yard is ideal as he LOVES the outdoors. No cats! He has a high prey instinct. \n\nDog & Cat Paw Salute to You\nGabriela Pataro\nFB Gabriela Dallas\n214.240.9330",

My foster mom says I am a sweetheart, and it's hard not to fall in love with me when you look into my eyes.\n\nI love people, and am friendly with all dogs. I love to snuggle, and get belly rubs. I am super curious of all new sounds and smells. I am a little afraid of the crate but I have been learning to sleep in it now. I was super scared of car rides but I am also starting to enjoy them too.\n\nMy foster mom says I am super athletic and I enjoy going on hikes too. Even though I like to be outdoors, l don't mind going on just short walks and just hanging around the house as long as I get some attention and snuggles from time to time. When I am super excited, I can jump as high as 5 Ft.\n\nAlso, you might want to keep an eye on me from time to time because when my foster mom is not around that's when I explore the kitchen counters for yummy human food. I am still a big puppy so I'm still learning the house rules but don't worry I am a sweet pup.\n\nOverall I really am a great pup and I can't wait to meet my forever family! \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again.

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

            "description": "Introducing Elzar, a handsome house trained four year-old Labrador Retriever, Hound Mix. Elzar walks well on a leash and easily follows directions without pulling. Elzar knows sit, down, place and is very treat motivated. He is one smart cookie and is eager to learn new tricks! Elzar is crate trained, and can sleep in his crate overnight or be left alone in the crate during the day. This means that you can go run your errands with the peace of mind of knowing that Elzar is chilling at home. He can also be left alone outside of his crate as he is not destructive. Elzar is very calm and well-mannered and enjoys meeting new people. Elzar loves to lay next to and lean on his person. He will lay his head on your knee, lap, or arm. Elzar enjoys gentle, tender affection, and prefers to stay away from rough-housing after developing a trusting relationship. Elzar is a loving and gentle companion who would make a great buddy. Elzar loves to be with his people, either laying on the couch with them or relaxing in the sunshine in the backyard. He loves going on walks, laying in the grass, riding in the car, and having picnics in the park. When he gets excited, he bounds around, and his ears flop up and down in the most adorable way, he will melt your heart. Elzar can become anxious in a high-stimulus environment, so he would prefer a low-energy home with adults only, and preferably no other pets. It is possible he can share a home with another low-energy dog. Elzar would like a house or 1st floor apartment with no shared stairwells. Would you like a furry friend to share car rides, walks in the park and picnics? Come meet the awesome Elzar today!",

He's social with other dogs, big & small, and is so tolerant of puppy energy. Great with kids, loves men and chasing birds. Poor Maximus was grossly overweight when he arrived from the shelter. We have gotten him town to a healthy weight and now he's ready for a home of his own to continue is health and journey.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\n\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed. An application, home check, contract and adoption fee are required for all adoptions. All dogs will be, or required to be, spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped before adoption. Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\n\nAdoption fees vary between $400 - $500 for puppies 8 weeks - 5 years, $350 6 - 9 years and $300 for dogs over 9 years. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip, a wellness check, any additional medical expenses necessary and of course all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\n\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\nWe are a busy fully functioning rescue and facility, unfortunately, we do not take requests for more photos and/or video.

He loves people, especially kids, but Frodo needs and wants to be the one and only, so a family without other pets. His fear and insecurity make him reactive to other dogs, so he would do best in a quiet neighborhood or rural area. People fall in love with him when they meet him and he leaves smiles everywhere he goes. He truly needs a family who will love the insecure dog on the inside!",

Why is this adorable little dog still looking? Kylee's one obstacle is that she really prefers to not be around other dogs. She doesn't like or trust other dogs and will become reactive if they are in her space. She would love a home that is ok with just Kylee and that does not need to have a dog social dog.

Ollie is 5 years old and has skills he loves to show off to anyone who visits him. He lived the first few years of his life in a very secluded place, so the outside world sometimes scares him and he responds by trying to act tough. He's incredibly smart and loves to learn tricks and play games.\n\nThe home that is ideal for him is one that doesn't have any animals or any animals next door. A country villa with birds chirping sounds good to him. If you think Ollie could be the guy you have been looking to spend your time with please fill out an adoption questionnaire.",

Now that her pups are grown and have all been adopted, this sweet 2 year old is looking for a forever home of her own.\n\nAt a perfect 45 lbs, this little action-packed darling is ready for adventure, for playtime, and especially for snuggles. She's very smart, likes to be active (goes for several mile runs a few times a week) and loves to be close to her people.At a perfect 45 lbs, this little action-packed darling is ready for adventure, for playtime, and especially for snuggles.

Her favorite activity is tug and her favorite toy is a tennis ball or 3 that she likes to carry all at the same time in her mouth! She lives to play with her toys! But China is also looking for a person to give her all to, to connect with, and to love. She's as smart as a whip, kid friendly and loves to go for car rides. While she is tolerant of other dogs, they don't hold a candle to a human's attention! We think she would prefer to live as an only dog.\n\nUnfortunately her first few years of life were not very kind. She lived chained to a tree and was starved. This made her a little hesitant to trust other dogs and people, so she can be a little shy at first and sometimes reactive of other dogs when on leash. But once you get to know her, she's full-throttle fun and also a superb snuggler. She knows sit, down, touch, and high-five! She loves water, whether it's a kiddie pool or a river and somehow always finds the mud! If you're looking for some excitement and a dog who will make you laugh, look no further than China!

A few months ago, Brandon was badly injured and required emergency neck surgery. Because Brandon is now so fragile due to the hardware in his neck, he can never jump on or off a couch, chair or bed, in or out of the car, stairs... you probably get it. If his hardware gets compromised, they will not be able to fix it. Because of this painful experience and needing to be handled by many people, Brandon can be a bit sassy until acclimated with you and sometimes when being handled by those he knows too. Can we blame him though?\n\nDespite what he's been through, Brandon is a feisty, fun and silly boy! He loves to play, especially with his balls and go for fun walks where he can explore everything! Brandon will protect you from intruders and keep your lap warm and heart full. He does well with dogs his own size, but no big dogs because they are scary, and no kids!\n\nDo you think you could be a match for Brandon and are willing yo figure him out and follow his needs?\n\n*We have an application and interview process. Completing an application is not a guarantee of approval. We do best fit for both dog and family.",

            "description": "Jordan Elliott is a dog in need of some rest, relaxation and TLC. He may not have had the easiest life so far, but he seems ready to start on his next chapter! Jordan is an active boy who seems to enjoy getting out and about to sniff and explore. He has a playful side and is friendly with people. He seems pretty overwhelmed by the hubbub of the kennel, and can be a little sensitive to sudden movements or loud noises - he would love a quiet, loving place to unwind and learn how to enjoy the good life of a dog. Jordan is around 3 years old and weighs 45 lbs. Jordan arrived at the kennel heartworm positive, so will need a place to rest and recover. We cover the cost of the treatment, he just needs someone to give him medication and keep him calm while he recovers from treatment. Please contact us for more information!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

            "description": "Have you met Kizzy?\n\n9-year-old Kizzy was an owner surrender into Long Beach Animal Care Services and became a Frosted Face in July 2020. Kizzy doesn't like being reached towards and is bitey at quick movements in her direction. She is reserved and keeps to herself, but there's a whole lot of love hidden under that armor of insecurity.\n\nOne of our volunteers has a knack for connecting with reserved and snappy dogs. Of Kizzy, she shares, \"Kizzy sadly gets overlooked at Open House. She will not run up to greet you, begging for pets, or jump up on your lap, but if you take a little time to get to know her and get down on her level, you'll find that she loves having her head stroked, and a good scratch behind her ears. Once you gain her trust, she will seek you out for scritches and hop onto a dog bed next to you and settle down for a snooze. She deserves a quiet home environment, and a person of her own to love.\"\n\nWe know a lot about what Kizzy is like in a home environment, because she went on two-week Frosted Fling! According to her Fling mom, Kizzy knows commands \"sit\", \"down\", and \"shake\"! She did well with the other dogs in her fling home, as well as ones she met on walks and at the park. Kizzy was potty-perfect in her Fling home and went to the door or whined to let her family know she needed to go out. Kizzy enjoyed many naps during the day and slept through the night.\n\nWe are looking for a patient and understanding family who would give a dog like Kizzy the time she needs to feel secure again. If you think that might be you, stop by to meet her during our next Open House!\n\nOpen House: every Saturday and Sunday 10:00 am - 1:00 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/28/21 KG",

She loves chasing tennis balls and going for walks. She stays right next to us on our country road when we are walking, without a leash.  Lola  just hasn't had anyone do any training with her.  \n",

It takes me time to warm up to new people (and I mean quite a bit of time... not just an hour, we'll grow our bond over the days and weeks together- before you know it I will be jumping up with excitement to greet you when you come home). The silly thing is that even though I may run from you if you come at me directly, I'll still be your shadow and FOLLOW you everywhere- I know it's a quirky kind of love. I'm good with other dogs and really need one in my forever home to help raise my confidence (oh, and cats are fine too but I just ignore them). I'm housetrained, I'm learning to play with toys, and I'm working on my basic manners like \"sit\". I'm looking for an adult only home since kids can overwhelm me. If you have a little bit of patience to give, I have a lot of love to give in return.",

            "description": "Meet Taco!\n\nCHIHUAHUA LOVERS!!! His muzzle maybe gray but his heart is young. Taco is a 8 year old Chihuahua who has been in rescue a couple months. Him in your typical Chihuahua fashion is a fierce protector and a loyal companion. Once he knows you, you are part of his pack but that initial stare down can be something. Taco would do best in a home with no children. He would love humans that are home all day to provide a lap and endless pets. Taco wants to be your Chihuahua. \n\nInterested in meeting Taco? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Meet Brooklyn! \n\nBrooklyn is a 2yo 11# spayed chi mix from Alabama who just wants to love you! Her favorite things are chewing on toys, cuddling through naps, and kissing you at every opportunity, convenient or otherwise. She\u2019s doing great so far with our 2 cats and 2 small dogs. No exposure to kids yet, but since she can be a tad nippy when excited, slightly older kids should be ok. No bathroom accidents in the house so far!\n\nInterested in meeting Brooklyn?\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

He loves sleeping in bed with his people!\n\nGator needs a very secure 6' or higher privacy fence or a very active adopter.  He would not be able to be crated, as he is an escape artist,  Therefore, he would need a home where he could roam free in the house.  His new owners also need to be at home most of the time because he loves to be around his people. Gator is very active, so a running partner would be great for him!\n\nGator is a very sweet, smart, obedient, lovable dog who just needs a place to call home.  Could you be his match?  If so, please email us at info@adoptagoldenatlanta.com and someone will respond.",

            "description": "Meet Bruno Mars! Bruno has similarities to a Lab mix and is 2 years old. He was found abandoned on the streets in Mississippi waiting for weeks for his people to return. After a volunteer saw him waiting and waiting they went and rescued him. Bruno is around 60 lbs. and fully vetted. He is good with the dogs at his foster home and is so sweet. Since being in foster care, we discovered that he is farsighted and cannot see anything clearly up close. It does not effect his behavior, it's just something to be aware of that he does bump into things as he can't see them clearly. He will require a home with a physical 5ft or higher fenced yard as he has in the past tried to escape a shorter yard to go adventure and he was not able to find his way back. Bruno is house trained and walks well on the leash. Bruno Mars will due best in home with kids 10 and up and no cats, due to him not being able to see up close. He has a prey drive like most labs as he went after chickens in the fosters home. He is a total lovebug who enjoys lap snuggles. He LOVES to play. He will play with humans, dogs anyone willing to give him playtime. He is a bit mouthy when getting into play mode, but easily correctible by saying his name. He has so much love to give. Bruno Mars loves other dogs and we would love for him to go to a home with other dogs. His foster states that he rarely ever barks and is such a good boy.

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nLab lovers, meet Melanie, a 1.5 year-old Black Lab mix girl who has a great disposition and sweet personality. She posed so seriously for the camera that her cheerful exuberance doesn't come through in her photos. You'll have to meet her in person to see what a true delight she is! We don't have any history on his lady as she came to us as a stray from an overcrowded county dog shelter but we've been impressed with her gentle demeanor since she arrived here with us to work on finding a permanent new home. Melanie gets along great with some dogs but doesn't like others. Given that she can be picky about her dog friends, she would do best in the home as an only dog. She has also shown leash reactivity around other dogs when out for a walk so would do best in a home in a quiet neighborhood with lots of space so she wouldn't have to encounter many dogs on a daily basis. Melanie also needs a kitty-free home. She settles down nicely in her crate for a nap once playtime is over and has had excellent crate manners in her foster home so may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. Melanie loves to go for a walk but does need to work on her leash manners as she likes to pull ahead to explore. She has done well with an Easy Walk Harness and that is recommended as she polishes her leash skills. With some daily practice, she's going to make an excellent hiking, jogging, or walking buddy for her new family. Melanie weighs about 55 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Melanie. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Melanie and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

She loves to be outside (and does require a fenced yard) and will nap the day away in the sun. Yarrow bonds really well to one person and with some time can come around to others. Yarrow is looking for a very low key home where she will not be expected to be the life of the party. She is a lover who will be your faithful and loyal companion. She is accepting of male dogs her size but really would like to be the only animal in the home. If you are single and looking for a dog to curl up by your side and be your best friend Yarrow is it. She is house trained, likes moderate exercise and naps. If you are interested in Yarrow please call the shelter and ask to speak with Christa or Megan.",

They do ok with other animals, however they shouldn't be left alone with smaller pets, because they like to play rough and if the other animal becomes aggressive, they will too.

They both love to frolic in the cool weather and love being rubbed and loved on. They both don't like loud noises, and when Betsy's nervous, she'll turn over her water bowl and move her food bowl for her foster to find. They do ok with other animals, however they shouldn't be left alone with smaller pets, because they like to play rough and if the other animal becomes aggressive, they will too. Overall, they are very loving sweet girls who need each other and are sometimes anxious.",

The application is important and necessary for this reason.\u00a0\n\nAll of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\nBASIC INFORMATION:\n\nSuggested Breed(s): Pit Bull Terrier/Border Collie Mix\nGender: Male/Neutered\nApprox. Age or D.O.B:\u00a010 months\nApprox. Weight: 51 lbs (full grown)\nCoat Type:\u00a0Short\nGood around most dogs:\u00a0Yes;\u00a0playful, submissive dogs\nGood around most cats: Not yet tested\nEnergy Level: Medium/High\nFence yard may be required: Yes\nAny other specifics:\u00a0\u00a0We committed to help\u00a0Elliot James out of a shelter that euthanizes for time and space with only minutes to spare. He is teen pup with so much life left to live, he begged for a second chance with his eyes and his huge, happy smile. One of the volunteers who transported him, gave him the name Elliot after her son that past away in a tragic car accident when he was hit by a drunk driver. She wanted to help honor him by sharing his name with this well deserving pup. His middle name was James.\u00a0\n\nElliot James is wonderful around the children in his foster home and has loved everyone he has met. He is a playful dog and would do best with a submissive female dog or he'd also do well as the only dog to receive all his human's love and attention.\u00a0\n\nWill you be a Hero in Elliot James'\u00a0story?\n\nVisit our website/Click on Adopt to APPLY today!\u00a0 RARErescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $185.00\n\n\n\nPlease REMEMBER, All of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are a non-profit organization without municipal or government funding. Veterinary/Medical expenses are constant for an animal rescue. Our adoption fees not only help to provide vetting and care for the animal being adopted, but they also help to cover heartworm treatments and other treatable ailments that many animals, that would otherwise be euthanized, need in order to be made available for adoption.\n\n\n\nPlease understand that adopting an animal is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to that animal and there will be veterinary expenses throughout their life that can often cost several hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (without pet insurance), especially without annual checkups and preventative care.\u00a0 As a potential family for this pet you are responsible for their safety and that includes keeping them on your property.\n\n***If you are not in the middle Tennessee area, transport can potentially be arranged to approved homes, depending on distance and local adaptability. We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 1.5 hours driving distance.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, foster, or aid in the rescue efforts of RARE!",

Thank you!***\n\nBella is an 11-month-old, purebred, female, German Shepherd Dog who is available for adoption. She has come through a very long journey since she arrived in our care.\n\nAt 8 weeks old, Bella was hit by a car and surrendered to our rescue. What followed has been 10 months of hard work and dedication by her foster parents, caregivers and volunteers. Bella has had extensive medical and rehabilitation at Blue Pearl. She had an MRI and, most recently, full body X-rays to ensure nothing is hindering her from reaching her goal to be 100% mobile on her own.\n\nFortunately, Bella has never met a person she didn\u2019t love. She is incredibly friendly and loving. Bella loves to greet visitors at her foster home and at the park or on walks. She also loves other dogs she meets, so a home with other male dogs or no other dogs would suit her well.  Bella also loves car rides.\n\nBella is at the point where she can stand on all four legs and is upright on all four legs for walking for short periods (as seen in the videos). She will need a dedicated home to continue with her down this path. Bella will provide her new home with tons of love and kisses and devotion.  It is the right time to find that perfect home for her.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fXt8SzbpQF8\n\nIf you would like to adopt Bella, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only. IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH YOU WILL BE CONTACTED typically within 72 hours. YOU WILL HEAR FROM US ONLY IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH FOR ONE OF OUR RESCUE ANIMALS AND OUR ADOPTION GUIDELINES/PROGRAM. WE MUST REVIEW A COMPLETED APPLICATION BEFORE A POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT IS ARRANGED. NO EXCEPTIONS. All visits with the puppies/dogs are by approved applications and appointments only.\n\n* We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification and not all applications or inquiries may receive a response. *\n\nThank you for your interest in our rescue dogs.",

This covers their Spay/Neuter, Vaccinations, Microchip, 4DX, Fecal Tests, and Housing Costs. ********************************************************************************************************\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of Laken's Needs:\n-quiet home with no kids\n-no cats\n-no shared walls/quiet neighborhood\n-likes other dogs but you need to provide structure during a long introduction as he has no dog manners and does things other dogs do not appreciate\n-an owner that understands stress signals/dog language\n-an owner who can advocate for him and provide ongoing confidence and obedience training. We will ask for your experience and game plan on how you plan to do this.\n\nIF you are still interested, read on to learn more!\n\nHi there! My name is Laken, and although I\u2019m with Minnesota Pit Bull Rescue, I'm not a pit bull. What I am is a handsome adolescent Rottweiler! I came to find my way into MPBR after being picked up as a stray. The shelter said I was showing signs that I was really nervous so the great folks at MPBR got me into a foster home where I can relax and start to work on some obedience and confidence skills. My birthday is approximately 4/18/2020. \nI would love to find a family that will advocate for me and help me to build my confidence. I tend to be a little more unsure when meeting new people and prefer to meet them before they can meet me. (That means my owner doesn't let people approach me but rather has the person stand still and I sniff them on my own terms.) This helps to keep me from nervous/excitedly urinating in new situations (which I have done on occasion). Due to my insecurities, when meeting new people my foster believes it would be best that I live in a home without the chaos of children.\nI also sometimes get overly excited when trying to share affection and sometimes give a little face punch vs just a nice lick... and the littles definitely aren't prepared or even equipped to work with that (I sometimes still take my foster by surprise with this). I'm not always the greatest at knowing personal space as well as boundaries or home etiquette, my foster says this makes me a little rude so I'm trying to gain a better understanding of what rude behaviors are and control them a little better! I am also trying to learn how to keep my frustration voice under control and can be somewhat vocal in my kennel at times when there are things going on that I want to be a part of.\nA home that doesn't share walls and a home that isn't located in a busy area would probably be best. I've also shown a bit of a tenacity to quickly chase small critters that run from me so no cats for me please.\nDogs- well I have met a lot of them, and I LIKE all of them... none of them have liked me. I do things like chew on their legs, come at them full force, try to mount them, etc. (All the things that I shouldn't do when introducing myself to new friends). It is extremely hard for me to remain calm around them which I need to work on if I am going to have off leash time with dog friends. For now, I need to be on a leash when around other dogs.\nI LOVE playing with several squeaky silicone balls in my foster home... although most of them don't squeak anymore, but they're still AWESOME!\nI do well crating and am kennel trained. I do well going to the bathroom outside as long as it's supervised to make sure that I go to the bathroom as I don't really like to be outside alone and tend to turn around quick to head back inside. It is important than I am accompanied outside by my owner as I do tend to show barrier aggression. This happens both while I am in my crate and there is a new human in the home and while I am outside and new human walks by the fence line.\nI'm a strong and growing guy who needs someone that's ready to help me develop confidence while also showing me guidance and boundaries through ongoing training. If you think you\u2019re the person for me, please visit www.mnpitbull.com for adoption information as well as their online application.\n\nLaken is our Dog of the Month for February. What that means is his adoption fee is waived. The normal adoption process will still apply (home check/reference checks/etc).",

My foster mom also calls me \u2018sweet lady\u2019 because that is what I am. Super sweet and gentle even though I have not been treated well. I love my humans and I just want to hang out with them. I have a great disposition and love people. I tend to jump up when I am excited but with redirection I have been doing well not jumping. \nI am 6 years old and have a few health issues* that are being addressed currently. I am known as a blue nose. I weigh about 55 lbs. but am on the shorter side.  \nI am an active girl that would do well with a buddy dog. I find the hamster very strange and intriguing and I really want to play with her, but mom tells me I can\u2019t, and I leave her be. \nI love to play with toys and interact with people, but I also am able to spend time alone in my kennel with no problems. I sleep in my kennel at night, after being tucked in of course.\nMy most favorite place to hang out and nap is moms lap of course. I like to hang out with mom while she is working too. I am still learning the ropes of living in a house and interacting with people indoors. I have a hard time on the bed and snuggling I have not figured that out yet. I also follow mom everywhere. Mom is teaching me that I am not going to be left behind which has helped. \nI am currently perfecting my sit, stay, and shake skills. I am so eager to learn anything I am taught. I also am working on my leash walking skills. I was never taught properly on this and it is apparent. Mom is helping me with that. We work in the back yard mostly but that is because the weather has been so weird this fall and my toes are itchy, so mom doesn't want me being near the salted sidewalks.\nI LOVE SNOW and I like to eat it! It\u2019s like a cold splash in my mouth that I enjoy.\nI have not been around cats, but I do have a foster brother dog and 2 kiddos that I have done very well with and that weird hamster thing in the cage. I sure would love to meet you and become a part of your family. \n\n*Medical notes- \nHope came into the shelter in very rough shape medical wise. She had hair loss all over and a large lipoma (fatty lump) on her left back leg. She has improved greatly over the past few weeks and her coat is looking great! She does have allergy flair ups here and there. She is on Apoquel while we figure out her allergy issues. This may or may not be a long-term medication to help with allergies. It is approximately $65 a month. We also wash her feet when she comes in from outside as those are what bother her the most when her allergies do flair up. In the next few weeks, she will go into our vet for her spay and lipoma removal. We will send the lipoma out for biopsy, but they are usually harmless. We will continue to update her bio as more information becomes available.\n\n12/21/20 Update- Hope had surgery Dec 4, 2020 to have two tumors removed and sent out to pathology. The pathology results on Hope's tumors came back as low grade mammary carcinoma. These particular tumors appear to have arisen from benign mixed mammary tumor. Carcinomas such as these tend to have a prolonged survival time. Based on her age and the prolonged survival time, we have decided not to put her body through the stress of chemo. Hope will hopefully have a few good years left but we do not know her life expectancy. We do believe she deserves a home of her own to spend her final days, months, years! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Hope, please fill out an adoption application at www.mnpitbull.com. \n\n",

But with some good food and TLC, Hai Iro has shown who he really is - an energetic goofball! Volunteers who regularly handle him report that he loves playing with stuffed animals and knows to sit and wait when playing fetch! He gets really excited meeting people and wants to jump all over them and give lots of kisses. He is very motivated to work for treats and loves getting belly rubs! So far Hai Iro prefers to not be with other dogs and he is looking to be the only animal in the home. But with all the love he has to give who needs another? If you think Hai Iro would be a good match for your home, please schedule an appointment with a virtual adoption counselor to get more information on him. Check out my photos/videos!",

Harry is my name and I'm a Golden Lab/American Staffordshire Terrier mix. I've got a beautiful gold coat and am just the right size at 46 pounds. If you're looking for an outgoing, medium size dog, I'm your guy! I do not like cats, so my new home has to be feline free, and I cannot go to a home with children under 15. I was transferred here from a rescue in South Dakota so that I could have a better life.

We took him to Iowa State for imaging but sadly, Eli's injury is too old to correct surgically. Since it causes him no pain the decision was made to leave Eli as he is, an adorable Ratty/Chi mix with a kickstand. A further complication from Eli's accident was that it rendered him somewhat incontinent, the poor thing. Nonetheless, Eli is precious. He is a tiny little thing with the cutest face and enormous ears. He is a very sweet boy who loves human cuddles and the other little dogs. Eli enjoys sunning himself outside on warm days, and snuggling under blankets when it's chilly. He is very excited to know that he will soon have a new family to call his own.\n\nVisit Eli at www.hua.org!",

She is a little reserved with strangers but given a little time, she warms up and then is very friendly. Shimmer gets along with both male and female dogs and she loves to play but she needs slow introductions with new dogs. Shimmer loves to be with her person and is probably a lab / hound mix. She needs a privacy fence because she is so smart, she will climb a chain link fence to get her person. She weighs 50 pounds and is full grown with a birthdate of 6/10/18. She is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on her vaccinations. Shimmer is looking for an inside home where she can be lavished with love.\n***************************************************************************\nThis pet comes with an implanted 24 PetWatch microchip and free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service. \n***************************************************************************\nThis dog is available for adoption at the Humane Society of McCormick County in South Carolina for an adoption fee. All of our dogs are indoor dogs with outdoor privileges. To adopt, contact 864-391-2349 or HSMC2000@gmail.com. We are an all-volunteer 501c3 organization.

It took some time for caregivers and volunteers to win her over by bribing her with treats and kind, gentle words. Once we earned her trust, Zelda became a new dog. She loves walking on her leash, loves playing in the yards, and gets along with other dogs. She is both active and calm - a perfect combination. She also knows some basic commands and finds much joy in a car ride. Zelda is very smart, and this change has been hard on her. But, she is starting realize she is okay and has become a loving, cuddly, sweet, confident German Shepherd girl.\n\nVisit Zelda at www.hua.org!",

            "description": "Scarlett is a petite pittie mix estimated to be about 6 years old with a unique brindle coat who came to us as a stray through Animal Control. A kind family had found Scarlett and tried desperately to find her owners but were unsuccessful. She had minor injuries and wounds from life on the streets, but she has since made a full recovery! \n\nScarlett mostly ignores or avoids other dogs but does not mind calm and confident dogs. We don't know how Scarlett feels towards cats but could test her if you\u2019re interested. Scarlett has met a couple of kids in foster care but has not engaged with them directly. Given her immature play style, we recommend she not go to a home with young children. \n\nScarlett is as sweet as she is smart. Her favorite activities include watching TV, taking long walks/hikes, sunbathing on the patio, going for rides in the car, and being the perfect companion no matter where you want to go! Scarlett is crate trained, potty trained, excellent on a leash, and continuing to practice and master obedience commands. She is looking for a family without small children, where she can continue learning appropriate play behaviors, and feel safe in a home with patience, structure, routine and consistency. Ideally Scarlett will be the only dog in the home, but she can also be successful with a mature, confident dog. \n\nScarlett loves being part of everything you do and has endless love to give her furever family. She thrives on routine with a confident leader, is a quick learner, and is desperate to please. While she may be 6 years old, she has the heart of a puppy and loves to play and explore outdoors. If interested in Scarlett, fill out a survey today at https://www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey today!\n",

He has great potential to be a perfect pup but he will need continued training to help him gain the social skills and confidence necessary for a dog his size.  Gatsby is a big snugglebug and enjoys cuddling up with his humans or spending time outside.  He loves car rides and would make the perfect adventure companion.\n\nGatsby is neutered, vaccinated, and comes with one free training session at Charliebar Boarding & Training in Gilbert.

Rascal is house trained, knows some basic commands, walks on a leash decently, but has some room for improvement. He is good with another high energy dog/dogs because he gets very excited and can get carried away. He likes cats, but can be too much for them because he likes to be right in their faces.  He is social and enjoys meeting new people. Rascal is a very vocal dog so apartment living would not be a good fit.

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nMary came to IDR+ from our friends in Puerto Rico! Our vets think she is about 10 years old, and we are treating a long list of medical issues, so her adoption fee is sponsored through our Guardian Angel program. Mary has a grade 3 heart murmur, but the cardiologist said that she does not need medication at this time. The chest x-ray was normal--no heart enlargement or evidence of other concerns. Thanks to the SASS program at Vet Specialty Center, Mary was spayed and had 3 mammary tumors removed--you can see them in the \"before\" photos. The surgical interns got clean margins, and the lab confirmed they are benign. She had an ultrasound before surgery, and her spleen and lymph nodes show some enlargement, but nothing too concerning, so those will need to be monitored. One enlarged lymphnode was removed and also confirmed to be benign. In her foster home, Mary is a very sweet girl! She loves the resident Dobes, is housebroken, and likes her crate. She barks at the young neighbor kids, so she'd appreciate older kids (12+). Although Mary has a lot going on, there is no reason to number her days. If you'd like to be her Guardian Angel, she would love to spend her golden years in your home.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

Bowie was adopted and then returned because he was too much for the new owners. They were looking to make him a Service Dog and sent him to a trainer. After working with him, the trainer explained that Bowie's 2 breeds (Rottweiler and Husky) proved to be very stubborn and he would not make a good Service Animal. He is aggressive with other animals on walks and hikes and needs someone experienced with the breeds and the size. He is also still having some potty-training issues where he is peeing indoors, but luckily pooping outside. :) Now that we have the negative out of the way, you should know that this big, strong, boy is loving and affectionate and would make a great companion for someone who only wants one animal, has the room for him to exercise and is willing to be patient with him and willing to continue with his training. please submit an application first then make an appointment.",

She enjoys the occasional walk and napping on the couch. Sassy knows how to sit, stay, laydown and give paw. She would prefer to be only dog in the house and would like someone who could be home with her most of the day. She lost her home after they were no longer able to care for her and she has developed some separation anxiety from it. She will need to be crated when left in a sturdy kennel. We feel she would so so well in a home with a family that is home, she has so much love to give and deserves to be doted on.",

This 11 year-old, 69 pound, Pittie mix more than lives up to his name! \n \nSpecial is a fantastic fella looking for a mellow home to spend his golden years in. He\u2019s been a little overwhelmed at our shelter (who can blame him!) but overall he\u2019s an incredibly sweet boy. He\u2019s very treat-motivated and will happily show you how well he sits in exchange for a delicious morsel! He really loves bully sticks and other tough chew treats that he can really work at! \n \nSpecial hasn\u2019t shown much interest in toys while with us, but he\u2019s very polite on his leash. Nothing goes unsniffed when Special is out and about! He still has good energy and would definitely make a good walking buddy. Special has let us know that he isn\u2019t a fan of other pups, though. So he will need to be walked in quieter areas where there aren\u2019t lots of other dogs out walking or behind fences in front yards. Special has been loving with the people he has met, but is a little shy at first. Once he warms up to you he\u2019ll be leaning in for head pats and kisses! We recommend a home with no younger children for this beautiful beefy boy, he prefers a calm environment. No other pets in the home for him as well. Backyards and breed experience are both definitely pluses! \n \nThink you can give Special the wonderful home he deserves? Fill out an application below to make this handsome ham a part of your life! (CA)\n \nSpecial is also looking for a temporary foster home while he awaits his forever one. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRocket Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer nonprofit group dedicated to saving homeless and abandoned animals from euthanasia in overcrowded Bay Area shelters. We literally give them a second chance at life. And everybody deserves a second chance.\n\nAdopting a rescued animal is a lifetime commitment! Adopters must complete an agreement (http://www.rocketdogrescue.org/adopt/adoption-application/) and a personal interview prior to adopting a Rocket Dog. There is a non-refundable $280.00 adoption fee which helps us defer the cost of spay/neutering, vaccinations and microchipping.\nhttp://www.rocketdogrescue.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Rocket.Dog.Rescue\nhttp://www.petfinder.com/shelters/CA534.html",

We're estimating another 2 or 3 weeks.\n***All applications received will be kept on hold***\n\n\nCOURTESY POSTING FOR KONGKONG2 SHELTER IN KOREA.\nThey don't have ability to solicit and process applications from Korea\nso they have asked for my help. \n\n\n\nName: Chloe\n\nAge: appx. 4-5 years old\n\nBreed: Jindo mix \n\nGender: Female, spayed\n\nWeight: 10kg, 22lb\n\nVaccinations: All vaccinations completed\n\nSociability: At first, she is cautious around new people and new environments. She cowers and retreats if people reach out to grab her. But if she\u2019s left alone and kept in a routine for a few days, she quickly comes around and expresses affection and curiosity! Now she asks to be pet and cuddled, hops on the bed to sleep together, and is happy to see her foster mom after work. Right now on walks, she stops and hesitates a little when a crowd of people come toward her, but she is gaining so much confidence everyday!\n\nSociability with children: As a timid girl, she would get startled by kids\u2019 loud and sudden movements, but she will eventually get used to things. We do recommend older children, over 8.\n\nSociability with other dogs: She is a peacekeeper with other dogs, but if other dogs show aggression, she knows to protect herself by barking back. \n\nSociability with cats: Shows interest, but does not really socialize with cats.\n\nPotty trained? Yes, she potties and pees in designated areas, but she still pees on blankets on beds if no one is watching. I am closing all bedroom doors when I leave the house. \n\nSeparation anxiety/barking: She doesn't care if the house is empty and sleeps most of the day, but she has not been in a home without any other dogs, so we need to observe her in a different setting for separation anxiety. She barks at strangers coming into the house, but quiets down when shushed. \n\nFlight instincts? She can get startled if the person handling her is aggressive. But she does not instinctively run away from people or try to escape at her own peril. Rather, she freezes still if she feels threatened. \n\nBackstory: Chloe ended up at the shelter from street life. She unfortunately even got pregnant and gave birth at the shelter. Both of her children have been adopted, and Chloe\u2019s since been spayed, but she was found with heartworm disease on the same day. She braved through the month-long treatment and is now finally heartworm free! In her short life, Chloe has gone through a lot. It is no surprise that before she got spayed, she was closed off and standoffish toward people. But after she got spayed, and especially after she lived with Mr. Tak, our shelter keeper, indoors daily, she has come fully out of her shell and learned to express her need for love to people. Now, all she needs is a forever family! \n\n\n\ncontact adogsdreamrescue@cogeco.ca  if interested.\nNo phone calls please. \n\nAdoption fee  is $600\n$400 Used  to cover her flight from korea",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 9/6/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Dexter was found as a stray by a staff member. His owners were found, but they decided to surrender him to rescue and help him find the right forever home.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Lots of energy!!!!\nWeight: est 40 lbs but he's low and compact - lots of good muscle tone!\nHeight: est 21 in at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Dexter was originally brought to his home as a puppy but sadly, an accident sidelined his active family into a very sedentary lifestyle. Dexter needed more than they could give. They found a home but the home did not watch carefully and Dexter went a wandering for more action. He found Makayla, one of our caregivers with an affinity for bully breeds. She took him in and we were able to backtrack to find his first owner and get the whole story. Dexter s a young, active, playful puppy. He would love to have another active dog in his home but it's not a necessity. He would do well in a dog park setting to make up for not having a dog in the home.\n\nDexter is good with other dogs and cats!! He likes to hump other dogs sometimes but I think this is because he was alone when he was very young and he still needs manners with other dogs. He loves them but does not need to know how to play but he's learning. Dexter will need a fence in his home, young children are not recommended because he has a lot of puppy energy. He would love an active lifestyle with lots of walks and tons of play time!\n\nWhat is my personality like? He does well on his leash but is pretty active so would need a stern owner to correct his pulling as necessary(works best with treats and positive reinforcement). Dexter does not like being told no!! He enjoys toys of any kind!! He is good in his crate and will start whining if he has to potty! He is mostly house trained and knows a handful of commands such as sit and down. We are working on more. Dexter can get too excited outside and jump up and nip at your arms, we are redirecting this behavior by giving him a toy when he does this. He can be mischievous and hunt down things to get into but this is only when he gets bored and hasn't had enough time to play! Also he is a weird pooper lol and likes to walk while he poops, so I always know if he poops inside because he leaves a trail\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly, affectionate and happy all the time.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Birthdate is 3/26/2020 est.\n\nDexter is very loving and loves to cuddle when he is all tuckered out!! Dexter is a puppy who is growing into a young man and still needs to learn a few manners and would love someone to understand this and show him how to be a good boy all the time!\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Sweet Honey Love Muffin is a 7-9-year-old gal who is looking for a specific forever homelife. \n\nFirst, a bit about who Hun Buns is:\nThe folks that have helped Honey along her way describe her as a treasure. Honey has been in and out of homes and shelters her whole life but through no fault of her own. She has spent the last 3 years as a Montana gal in a home with multiple dogs and cats. She makes the perfect home office secretary and enjoys dreaming her day away in a cozy spot with a frozen marrow bone or a squishy squeak toy (kinda like a baby with a pacifier). While her legs are slow-moving, her tail is not. This gal cannot contain her love for you, life, and toys, and will show you how much she loves you and how thankful she is for you daily. \n\nHoney would fair best in a home without children. Kids are often unpredictable and Honey is looking for predictability considering her past life has been unstable. She loves having a cat sibling and could cohabitate with another mellow dog after proper introductions have been made. \n\n\nSecondly, her needs: While she's an easygoing gal in terms of personality she has mobility and allergy issues and will fare best in a home that she can have easy access to outside and doesn't have to accomplish more than a few stairs a day. She is currently on allergy medication - a simple pill once a day that costs around $30-40 a month. This medication does make her thirsty, hence the need to easily access an outside area. Honey enjoys short walks around the neighborhood but isn't a dog who needs exercise every day. She enjoys copiloting your car errands around town, sunning herself in a contained outdoor space, and really just being with you wherever you are.\n",

The adoption fee for Tobasco will be $175\nTobasco is an incredibly sweet, wiggly roughly year and a half old Redbone Coonhound mix. He is a doll and just wiggles his whole body when he meets you.\nTobasco is fine with other dogs, loves people, and would do best in a home with older kids or an adult only home. Tobasco lived most of his life in the country and some aspects of city life have been hard for him. He can be fearful of cars and loud noises. He also does not enjoy being confined in a kennel and would do best with someone who is willing to train him and allow him free roam of the house. Tobasco is housetrained and should adjust well to a home with a yard.\nTobasco will need at least a 6 foot fence.\nIf you are interested in Tobasco, please complete our online application which can be found at kcpaws.petfinder.com",

She is reactive towards other dogs, skateboards, bikes, and we believe that reaction is fear based. She needs an active owner who can but some good structure in place and put the time into Maven's training to help her manage her reactions. \n\nMaven is in the care of our friend of ours in Las Vegas, but can meet in neighboring states. \n\n",

            "description": "Lewis is 4 years young, 70 pounds. He is a handsome black and tan coonhound. He came to us from a nearby shelter. We got him neutered, all vaccines, dewormed and microchipped. He is energetic and smart - and responding well to B&B staff and volunteers who are interacting with him daily.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Max has bounced around a couple of homes due to some behavioral issues but with the right family that is dedicated to him and his training, he is a wonderful dog!\n\nMax will resource guard and is protective over his food, toys, and his person. His previous family claims he began this behavior after getting attacked at the dog park at the age of 2. The majority of the time he is a great dog with no issues, but he will need a family that is experienced and can work with him in the areas he has some issues. He is up to date on all shots, neutered, potty trained, crate trained, and walks well on leash unless he sees a bunny, squirrel, or another dog. \n\nSince Max can be protective of his person, Max needs a single owner home or a home with two very experienced and committed owners as he will likely end up bonding with and being protective of one of the owners. We will not place him in a home with multiple people (roommates) or kids. \n\nMax would do better in a non-urban area.  He's not a dog that can be left tied up outside a store and is a bite risk for strangers.  The owner will have to be vigilant about proper introductions. He's fluffy and beautiful, strangers and children will want to pet him.\n\nMax should be the only dog in the home with no cats.   Max is a great dog and has a lot of love to give to the right family. His adoption fee is $450.",

He makes a great lounge buddy but also enjoys being active and loves going to walks and adventures with his person.  \n\nRocky's previous male owner was abusive to him but he still loves males.  A quiet household is best for him.  He's loving and strong and doesn't know he's a big dog.  He can tip a person over with his enthusiasm.  A strong person to walk him is required.  \n\nRocky will need someone experienced with large breeds that resource guard, as he will guard his food and toys. He will thrive in a home that will work on training and structure with him.  \n\nRocky can do well with laid back female dogs but would also be great as an only dog. We do not recommend him with dominant males. No cats for Rocky.   Kids 12 and up (he's very strong and doesn't know how big he is)\n\nRocky is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $500.",

Call it tragic, ironic, unfair, sad... whatever your chosen adjective, the fact that this GORGEOUS DOG has zero ability to see himself or the world around him, is all the things.\n\nAnd yet... Smokey listens. He learns so fast because he pays attention and figures things out. A raised bowl with a cone in a new environment/home? No problem. Show him once and he will get it. Like blind humans, Smokey learns his environment relative to his surroundings. He will need a home without chaos or clutter (no kids to be safe) and folks who understand things gotta stay where they are so he can learn to navigate his forever home. He's listening to and learning from the other shepherd in his foster home and must have a confident dog in his forever home. He's playing fetch right alongside her! Smokey has encountered several cats and appropriately ignored them. He is in foster with a handful of dogs and he gets along well with everyone. Smokey finds comfort in others. Humans, dogs, you name it, he's into it because you see Smokey HATES being alone. Imagine having NO EYES and ZERO concept of your spacial awareness... I would certainly feel terrified all the time, especially without the presence of a reassuring figure. Someone to guide using his other senses... it makes complete and total rational sense to us that Smokey would panic when left alone. That said, his forever home will need to be capable of dealing with this. He will scratch doors and panic when left. He needs someone with him to reassure him and love him the vast majority of the time. He's been through the wringer... this doesn't seem so much to ask... One thing Smokey absolutely requires is consistency. He needs a routine and he needs repetition. He shouldn't be in a home with stairs or where a pool could come into play. He wants a fenced yard and would GREATLY benefit from a similarly sized dog to act as his guide dog, one patient and loving, well-mannered and even-tempered so if Smokey happens to bump into them, they aren't offended or retaliatory.\n\nSmokey needs a dadgum hero. He needs someone to just understand and love him because of and inspite of his hurdles. Someone who sees his scars as we do: a testament to his survival instinct and sweet, resilient nature. Smokey needs his family.\n\nSmokey is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. He is heartworm positive and has started slow kill treatment. Adoption donation is $250.\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter.

All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received.

I am a handsome neutered 3 yr old American Staffordshire terrier (perfect blue boy ) and I am just now learning what it\u2019s like to play with toys and how to get along with other dogs. I have been kenneled with my pittie friend Sadie my whole life. I am now with in a foster home . And I am so happy to be out of my dirty kennel. I am learning what it\u2019s like to actually be a dog and have someone care for me. My foster mom says that I am a fast learner I just had no one to teach me manners so I do like to jump an because of my size I don\u2019t realize my strength. So far I\u2019ve been really good with low key calm dogs here in my foster home. I may have an issue with dogs that are super energetic because I don't know when to stop playing. I have a med energy level would do best with a family with older kids. I\u2019d love someone I can play tug-of-war with and continue teach me what it\u2019s like to be spoiled. I also like going on car rides and seeing the world. I\u2019m doing really well on my crate training so that would make it pretty easy for me to be house trained. I will require a fenced in yard because I am so curious about new things! I do know that I am not good with cats because I will chase them. If you think you are the family for me, don't hesitate to contact us! And if you\u2019re interested in a second dog me and my friend Sadie have gotten along so good please check her out also. We have known each other for the past three years and that\u2019s all they\u2019ve known in their kennel together. Don\u2019t worry we will be totally fine if we are separated.\n\nTo schedule a meet n greet please fill out this form https://tinyurl.com/keelysadoptionday",

            "description": "Peanut Butter may come across as a bit intimidating at first, but that's just because being in a cage at the shelter can be scary for some dogs. \n\nDuring his enrichment sessions it's clear he's a big baby who loves to run and play. He wants an active home that will spend quality time outside with him, playing and running around. \n\nPeanut Butter is a young adult between 2-3 years old. He's about 50 pounds. \n\nHe would be a best fit for a family or individual with direct dog experience. \n*****************************************************************************************************\nInterested in adopting?\n\nDue to COVID- 19 the shelter is closed to the public at this time.\n\nWe are still conducting adoptions, but with a few changes. :)\n\n1. Submit an application through our website at wacshelter.com if you are interested in giving one of our shelter animals a home\n\n2. We will schedule phone interviews once the online application has been processed.\n\n3. If the animal applied for is determined to be a good fit for the home, we will schedule a controlled in person meeting with the cat or dog prior to the adoption.\n\n*ADOPTION FEE:\n\n$95 (cash only) and includes:\n\nSpay/neuter\nFirst vaccines\nFIV/FeLV test (cats)\nHeartworm test (dogs)\nRabies vaccine (if old enough).\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nAdditional questions?\n\nDoes this dog get along with cats? There is almost always an acclimation period when a new pet joins the household. We are happy to suggest a few ways to ease the transition. A new dog should never be left alone with resident pets though.\n\nDoes this dog respond well to other dogs? No dog loves every other dog. A proper introduction (meet and greet) would be required as part of the application process.\n\nIs this dog good with children? The better question is how the children have been taught to handle animals. A dog will respond negatively if he/she is not being handled properly. We can offer suggestions on how to teach children to interact with dogs and pay attention to body language. Young children should never be left unsupervised with new animals.\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nWant to help a real shelter animal by adopting a Mini Plush Pet from our limited time fundraiser?

He is in a home with a male and female Rottweiler and makes a great playmate.\nEcho is completely house trained and crate trained and will never try to break out. He is such a sweetie, an all-around good boy. He has quite a bit of energy and walks would do him a world of good. Right now we are still working on the leash training, for some reason that leash makes him nervous even though he loves to go for a walk.\nHe also looks playing with balls. He has not been around many young children under 7-8 years old but does NOT have an aggressive bone in his body. He is a big goofball and a little clumsy like a lot of Rottweilers can be.\nAll 3 are needing to be rehomed due to family dynamics.\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spay/neutered (fixed), rabies shots appropriate for their age, and dewormed twice. The dogs are up to date on vaccinations according to their age at the time of adoption. They are microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative. ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and/or phone calls. We will reply to you. Thank you.",

She is a mix of Boxer and Pointer dog so she has the need to follow her nose. She is very observant and she wants to make sure everyone she loves is well taken care of. She can get overwhelmed with young children who are loud so having children 12 and over in the home is best. She loves playing with other older dogs but needs a slow introduction and she likes the rough and rowdies. She likes to be around cats but with her breeds she has a hard time staying still when they run. She will make an active family so happy and is waiting patiently for her forever home!

Since then, her puppies have been adopted, and she has come a long way in her foster home. To help with the transition to her forever home and make it a success, we are looking for a home similar to what she has now. \n-single family home with a fenced yard (she has a loud bark- too loud for a condo or apartment)\n-at least one other young, playful dog (same size or bigger as long as they like to play)\n- she also loves to play/snuggle with cats\n- no children under 10 (she tends to nip at clothes or arms/legs in excitement)\n\nBrownie likes to sit in people's laps and sleep in bed with them, but she is also great at going for walks and does several miles every day. She can easily gain weight if given too many treats or too much food and not exercised enough. Her love for other pets shows in the way she likes to play, snuggle and groom them. Of course, she also likes to kiss people. In the right home, Brownie will continue to thrive.\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the Greater Chicago Land area. Illinois only\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Archie! He was surrendered over to the shelter October 8, 2020 when his owner could no longer keep him. He is 3 years old, current on shots, and just a beautiful boy inside and out. He walks very nicely on the leash and loves soaking up affection with his human friends. His owners said he can escape when he is left alone and can get out of a 8 foot tall fence. He wants to be with his people.  We were told he needs a home without other pets but Archie hasn\u2019t been altered and if he interacted with other unaltered males that is very much a no go typically. We will spend time learning Archie and his likes and dislikes and update as we learn more. I can say he is a sweet sweet and handsome boy who seems a little starved for love and affection. Maybe you have the most am amazing FOREVER home for Archie?! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

This beauty queen is blind, diabetic, slightly hearing impaired and a couple of pounds overweight. Despite her ailments, Agnes is about as strong and confident as they come. Although she still bumps into things here and there, she pretty much mapped out her new digs in a matter of a few days. With the weight she's carrying, she's got a fancy little sashay when she walks that, truth be told, entertains the staff. For her health's sake though, we have her on the ever-successful Pug Nation diet. Agnes is full of life and isn't afraid of anything. We've found that she does get along with other dogs, but because she can't see, tiffs have broken out because she runs into them....and she's not one to back down. Once she has \"\"claimed\"\" her human, she's extremely loyal and prefers not to share the attention. She adores endless belly rubs and gives lots of kisses. Agnes does come with a list of health issues, but she is definitely worth the extra effort to care for her. Please consider this sassy senior as your next forever friend.",

He will need some work on his manners and commands but is a smart cookie. He seems to love everyone two and four-legged, but a meet and greet is always recommended with any potential canine siblings. We have had him playing and running around with several different dogs out back since he has been here with us. We are not sure how he would do with cats, but we think he would be more curious than anything about them. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines and prevention, and heartworm negative.",

Europa came to Labs and More with her 6 puppies. One of her ears had been torn off and both her back knees had been broken. In spite of her pain, she took great care of her babies and now she is safe and getting the medical treatment she needs. She will be ready in December once she is finished recovering from surgery. She has a gentle, affectionate demeanor. She is good with other dogs and even gets along with the cats. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Europa when she is ready for adoption, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! If you are already approved with a coach or have adopted from us before, please reach out to your coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported, solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

He is a new arrival so more to come or email us at codysfriendsrescue.com He is heart worm positive but he is currently under treatment. Beautiful boy.He is estimated to be 5 years old. He was found on a busy street and when the finder opened up her car door he jumped right in. He is not interested in being in charge. He's an easy dog. Want to go for a leisurely stroll, Rex will be happy to join you. (Hes great on a leash.) Want to binge a show, he'd love to nap on the couch with you. While his foster mom WFH, he looks out for squirrels and neighbors, sleeps, and patrols the house, checking in for pets along the way. He gets along fine with adult dogs, cats, puppies, men, and women, although he is mostly apathetic to other dogs and doesn't engage in much play. (He hasn't been exposed to kids. Due to his past, a home without young children is best.) He's not easily concerned; he has little reaction to the vacuum, cars, or fireworks. He was found on a busy street and when the finder opened up her car door he jumped right in. He is 9 weeks into heartworm treatment and is doing great! Anytime we are out he gets compliments on what a good looking and acting boy he is. He's never had an accident in the house and has been home alone for 8 hours with no destruction!",

Quite the social butterfly he is.   \n\nHendrix is good with children of all ages, cats and other dogs!  He has a great disposition and a big personality!\n\nHendrix suffered a spinal cord injury when he was about 3 months old, which has resulted in him losing the use of his back legs. He is currently undergoing laser therapy to help with healing and pain. He does wear a belly band to collect urine, which needs to be changed several times a day.  Hendrix will eventually be fitted with a wheelchair once he has gotten a little bigger. \n\nDespite his injuries, Hendrix is a very happy and lovable guy.  He loves to play with his toys as well as the cats and dog in the foster home where he lives. \n\nHendrix doesn\u2019t let his injury slow him down. He is active and truly enjoys life. Hendrix will make an excellent companion for a very lucky family. \n\nInterested in this special boy?  You can fill out our online adoption application for him at rescueapittie.org",

He is smart, loyal, and good-natured. Bug was surrendered to animal control because owners didn't want to pay to get his severe medical issue treated. He had that surgery after he came to us and he is fully healed and ready for a home and family.\n\nHe is housetrained and knows how to sit, stay, and shake. He could use some work walking on a leash. Bug is friendly with most other dogs.  He does really well with female dogs and all little dogs, male or female.  He has had some issues with large male dogs and intact males.  For this reason Bug will need to have a network of dogs to interact, hang and play with. He's not a good prospect for dog parks. He'd much prefer playdates with his pals.\n\nBecause of his size, he needs a home with a ample-size fenced-in spot to run around\u2013hopefully with you! When he's had the right amount of activity, he'll snuggle up on the couch next to you (his favorite activity).\n\nHe also needs a home with no cats (no exceptions). He'd do well in a family with older children.\n\nBug's big smile and warm heart will surely make any dog lover melt. Does this sound like you?\n\nBug's adoption fee includes spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and heartworm tested negative.\n\nQuestions? Contact us at connellpetrescue@gmail.com \n\nThank you! And Bug thanks you!\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n",

She is healthy and safe now and is waiting for her very own home. \n\nShe is a gentle giant but isn't aware of her size and can get very excited. For that reason she needs to be in a home with children 10 years and older. \n\nPenny is eager to please and does great without a crate and has been non destructive and doesn't have any accidents. She does not do well in a crate and she panics.\n\nPenny has been through so much and we would just love to give her a happily ever after new beginning.",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nMost of River's story is unknown. She was found as a stray with a belt wrapped around her neck that was used as a collar. She is one of the sweetest dogs we have come across. River is a bit shy at first but is very affectionate and loving to  people once she feels comfortable, which doesn't take very long at all!  She is full of energy, loves to play and walks around with a toy for most of the day.  Her foster mom says the minute she gets home River bounds towards her with excitement! \n\nRiver would do best in a home with kids over the age of 10.  Although she is VERY gentle, she is a bundle of energy, so we wouldn't want her to knock a little person down in play.  We would like to see River go to a home with a fenced yard so she can run and play  to her hearts content!\n\nThis sweet girl is housebroken and knows basic commands.  She is very intelligent and eager to learn.   She is approximately  2 years old and 55 pounds but slightly underweight so would welcome some extra treats . If you want a loyal best friend, to get lots of kisses and are up for playing fetch, reach out to learn more about this precious girl.  \n\nTo apply to adopt River, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary.",

He can be very shy and fearful at first, but once his new family gains his trust, Dobby will be a faithful companion!\n\nThis affectionate Shar Pei mix is looking for a home and a family who is willing to invest some time, love, and patience into him so that he can relax into the comfortable dog that his best friends at PAWS know him to be.\n\nDobby comes with a training package so that he can settle into his new home and learn the ropes. Ultimately, he just wants to sit on the couch and enjoy watching all the Harry Potter films with his new family! \n\nPlease reach out to PAWS if you are interested in meeting this dog!",

            "description": "Jack is a handsome 2-year old Pit Bull Terrier mix.  He weighs in around 45 pounds and is neutered, current on all his vaccines and has regularly received his Heartworm and Flea preventatives. Jack was adopted from a local shelter into a home with small children but he is a bit of a 'resource guarder' (toys, food) and plays too roughly with the kids. The family tells us Jack is a sweet boy, but gets a little 'mouthy' when excited. This could be worked on with some redirecting exercises. \nHe would do best in a home without kids or if there are kids, older ones. They want him to go to a great home and are offering to donate food and heartworm and flea/tick medications to his adopters.\n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you are interested in this wonderful pet, please complete an online application at sqrescueinc.org. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs. Incomplete or missing information will delay processing. For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

            "description": "This smiling face belongs to Robin, a 3 \nyear old Labrador Retriever mix (maybe hound?) from a local shelter. She is a sweet, energetic and smart girl who loves meeting new friends, the 2 and 4 legged kind.  Robin is very lovable and gentle with children once the 'ground rules' are set and the children are aware of how to treat, interact with and speak to a dog. \nShe has learned to use the doggie door by following her canine housemates and we think house-trained. Robin is spayed, current on her vaccinations and per the shelter, she was good with other dogs AND cats. She is Heartworm positive and will start her treatment soon - all expenses will be paid by SQ Rescue.\n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you are interested in this wonderful pet, please complete an online application at sqrescueinc.org. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs. Incomplete or missing information will delay the process. For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

            "description": "Whiskey is a handsome 3 1/2 year old 50 pound Cattle Dog/Australian Shepherd mix with a gorgeous silky golden coat. He loves to play fetch and also good at just hanging out. He likes to ride in the car and go adventures. One of his favorites things is going through the McDonald drive through for cheeseburgers.\n\nHe came to DSDA with a dislocated right elbow. He had surgery to repair the elbow so able to keep his leg. But he doesnt let it slow him down.\n\nWhiskey is a special boy and requires a specific home. He needs an experienced owner and will be happiest as only dog in the home. He loves to go for walks so an active owner is a must. He prefers women over men, but a home with a couple would be fine as long as the woman is home a lot and the man is patient. Whiskey's dream is a fenced yard with trees full of squirrels. \n\nRead more about Whiskey on Whiskey's Blog Post.\n\nIf you are looking for a gorgeous dog that has all the quirks and will keep you on your toes then Whiskey might just be the dog for you!\n\nTo meet Whiskey visit us at www.dsda.org/adopt for additional information regarding our adoption criteria and submit our online adoption application.\n\n* Adoption Fees:\n\nPuppies (under 12 months) - $325 (includes tax)\nDogs (12 months and over) - $275 (includes tax)\n\n* Home visits and vet checks are required.\n\n * If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, please fill out the online adoption application at www.dsda.org/adopt. \n\nQualifications for Adoption: No dog is alike and each dog has different requirements based on breed, age, energy level and life experiences. DSDA is very careful to place our dogs in homes that we believe are the best fit for the dog based on our experience with each dog. All of our dogs live in foster homes which allows us the opportunity to learn about their individual needs. \n\n\n\t\n\tMust be 21 years or older with identification showing present address.\n\t\n\t\n\tMust have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in the household.\n\t\n\t\n\tVet checks are required. All resident animals must be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative (if applicable).\n\t\n\t\n\tMust receive proof of pet deposit and lease allowing pets if renting.\n\t\n\t\n\tWillingness and capacity to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment and responsible care for a pet.\n\t\n\t\n\tApplicant is home more than not.\n\t\n\t\n\tHome visit is required. For this reason, we only adopt locally in the DFW area. Any poisonous plants must be removed from the yard before the home visit.",

If there are multiple applications for a dog, after all home checks are done,  the dog is adopted out to the home that is the best fit for that dog.\n \n ******Chicagoland Dog Rescue reserves the right to restrict adoption of a dog to potential adopters who live within a fifty (50) mile radius of Schaumburg, IL *****\n\nHello to my new person/family!!!! My name is Rocket and my whole world has been turned upside down!  My beloved human parents have both passed away and I don\u2019t get along with the resident canine at my current foster home.  A new home where I could be the center of attention would be amazing!   My foster parents say I am a truly lovable dog.  I am happy to cuddle on the bed or the couch but am just as happy to snooze quietly in my dog bed.  I am an empathetic soul who knows when someone is upset and will come right over to snuggle them to help them feel better.  I am also a pretty playful guy but I must admit that I LOVE to swim.  I think that is the lab in me!!!!  I would be an all around great companion for walks, cuddles, swimming and other adventures.  I will come to my new family housebroken, up to date on shots, neutered and ready to share an abundance of love!  If you would like to meet me, please send an email or fill out a pre adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to just as quick as they can!\nSnuggles and tail wags-Rocket\n\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $400-450.00,  which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

She is much happier than her pictures show, but she was a little camera shy.  Molasses loves to go for walks and anxiously waits at the front of her kennel, hoping to be picked. She still pulls on the leash quite a bit and is a very active girl. She will need an active family.  She came to the shelter very thin, but she is already starting to put on some much needed weight. Please email the shelter at cchs04@sbcglobal.net and request an application if you would like to meet this girl. Let's make her stay a short one!",

An application starts the process.  We are not able to answer calls with questions about the foster pugs. ***\n\nHi, I am Hendrix, a 10 year old handsome black pug. Are you a homebody? Love to hang out on the couch and read, maybe watch some Netflix? If so, you might be my perfect person!  I just want to hang out with someone who leads a calm lifestyle, likes to snuggle, and will take naps with me.  You see, I\u2019m also quiet, and I am deaf, but I get around inside my house just fine. I am a very good sleeper and I am told I snore quite loudly! \n \nMy foster mom calls me \u201chappy go lucky\u201d and very gentle. She thinks I\u2019m funny because I love to kiss her all over her face, but if she leans into kiss me, I lean backwards!  Foster mom does make me wear Man Pants (belly band!) because there is another male dog here in my foster home, and I mark because of it. It\u2019s okay if you have a female sibling for me, or want me to be an \u201conly child.\u201d If you think we\u2019d be perfect friends, please apply for me, Hendrix!\n\n***We encourage you to come to our adoption events to meet the pugs in person if you are interested in adoption. Again, please do not call regarding the adoptable pugs.  APARN is an all volunteer non-profit organization. We do not have a shelter. Our dogs are currently being fostered in private homes generally located throughout the greater Phoenix metro area.***",

Charlie would love to be your only companion, he wants you all to himself! He is looking for a family who is willing to put in a little extra effort to earn the trust. Once he's out of his shell he absolutely loves the beach, car rides, walks, McDonald's plain cheeseburgers and lots of hugs.",

She has a beautiful and distinctive brown, black and white coat, with a dab of white on the tip of her tail. She's about a year and a half old, medium-sized and fully grown. She's housetrained, knows how to sit, and is a fine size for a house dog. And look at that great smile! She guards her treats and food and is dog-selective, so bring your dog over for a meet-and-greet. She's energetic and playful, and very sweet. She's spayed, microchipped and up to date on her shots, and ready to start loving you today. Please come see lovely Addie!",

She is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and will be spayed before placement! \n\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue.

The county she came from has Breed Specific Legislation and she is not welcome there...not even in a loving home.  \n\nThe shelter was so overwhelming with all those dogs barking!  She would do best in a home where she can be the one and only and the center of attention! A home with bully breed experience is a plus!\n\nShe's super loving with people and really enjoys snuggling.  She is housebroken and crate trained.    \n\nCarrie arrived Heartworm positive and is almost finished with her treatment. \nShe has about 2 more weeks of \"rest\", meaning no running or exercise that elevates her heart rate.  After that, she will be ready to take on the world! \n \nCarrie is available for our Foster to Adopt program.  Foster to Adopt families have the first option to adopt if you determine this is the pup right for you!  \n\nWhile you foster, we pay all expenses from vetting, to food and we provide a crate, leash, collars, and toys. Your family provides love (something she really needs!) and a safe place to lay her head until she finds her forever home. \n\nPlease email foster@safehavendogil.org for a foster application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

            "description": "Meet Gracie... This little lady was surrendered to a boarding facility after her owner passed away. She is a Jack Russell mix who is around 10 years old and 23 lbs. Gracie is a friendly girl. She\u2019s great with all size dogs but if too active and get in her face will give a warning that\u2019s too much. She\u2019s mellow and loves to lounge and nap. She walks great on a leash and does still like walks and to explore the outdoor. She does well in the house and crate. She doesn\u2019t mind the car and is a pretty good all around girl. She does have a few \u201cold lady small growths\u201d as our vet likes to call them that aren\u2019t causing her any issue and our vet doesn\u2019t see reason for concern. He would rather leave them and wait until she needs to be sedated for something else and then discuss removing if needed at that time. She is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and spayed. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

He was abandoned at a high-kill shelter in Alabama with three siblings, but OBBR pulled him, and he's been getting his much-deserved royal treatment since arriving in Georgia! He's being treated for worms (not heart worm), will be neutered soon, and will undoubtedly wiggle his way into the perfect home soon.\n\nOddy has been great with a male, foster fur-sibling but also shown fence aggression with the neighboring dog who instigates. After being guided away from the fence that first time, he learned quickly not to engage. He is intelligent and has picked up on house rules very quickly.\n\nThis sweet guy would love to be with a family who can dote on him, as he's usually nearby waiting for your affection. He would sure like to be your lap dog if you allow it. He is house-trained, does fine in a crate, and is well-behaved in free roam. He knows \"sit\", \"down\" and is learning \"stay\". He even lays down before receiving his food bowl! Like many boxers around the world, he's very free with sweet boxer kisses.\n\nDoes this sound like a fella you could love? If so, you can submit an application to adopt at\nwww.obbrescue.org.\nAdoption fee is $275.00. To apply to adopt Oddy, visit our website at\nhttps://www.obbrescue.org/application-to-adopt-foster\n.\n\nCheck all available dogs by visiting our dog listing at\nhttps://www.obbrescue.org/copy-of-available-dogs\n.\nTo apply to adopt a dog, visit our website at https://www.obbrescue.org/application-to-adopt-foster.

Her favorite activity is taking an afternoon nap on the couch directly on top of whoever wants to take a nap with her. She is a great partner for neighborhood walks and usually easy to walk unless she sees a squirrel and just can't help herself! During the day she's happy playing with her tennis balls by herself or napping on the couch while her owners are working. She can't wait to find her forever home with someone who loves cuddling as much as she does! Want to learn more? Email them at atxdogfosterparent@gmail.com. Hazel weighs approximately 62 lbs.

            "description": "If youre looking for the perfect mix of sugar, spice, and everything nice - Abigail is your girl! This spunky little nugget refuses to let her disability stop her from enjoying every minute of each day. She is a 4 year old terrier mix who weighs around 35 pounds. Originally, she was found on the side of the road in rough shape with several broken bones. Due to the extent of her injuries, she has since had her front leg and a few of her toes removed. She now rocks a super fashionable cart as needed so she never misses out on a thing. Abigail enjoys the company of other dogs but due to her sensitive nature, she prefers calm, well socialized, and non-reactive pups. Her ideal home would be one with only one other dog as she can get overwhelmed easily around other animals. *No cats* for this gal as she tends to chase her fellow feline friends. Being a pup who doesnt always remember she has a disability, Abigail would benefit from a family who is home often and can watch over her to ensure her safety. She does best with children 13+ and older as she still has that puppy-like nature and can a rambunctious goofball at times. There is never a bad day with Abigail; its always smiles, laughs, and endless kisses. She is a real gem and without a doubt, a one of a kind pup. This very special little girl has a heart of gold and deserves a fun-loving family to share her life with. If you own your home in either Volusia, Lake, Orange, Seminole, or Osceola county FL with a fenced in yard and would like to meet Abigail, please fill out an adoption screening form: https://mettarescuefamily.org/adoptable-dogs",

My foster family rescued me from the Pasadena Shelter after I outwore my welcome, also known as a stray hold. YES, I was found as a stray! I can hardly believe it myself. I am sweet, extremely quiet and I hardly make any messes. My favorite past times are, napping and eating and napping some more. I am potty pad trained when Im in my kennel and I love to do my business outside. When I nap I sometimes have issues controlling my bladder so a waterproof bed and small throw blankets keep my space easy to clean. \n\nThe vet feels that I was a breeder dog cast off when my past life caught up to me. All the litters of babies have weakened my bladder, I have had extensive dental work and my mammary tumors have been removed. My family knows that not everyone will want an older girl with bedtime potty issues so they are committed to keeping me safe until the RIGHT family comes along. I know that there is a family out there that can accept me as the perfectly imperfect girl I am and LOVE me to the end of my days. If youd like to have a quiet girl that just wants to snuggle and love you until the end of her days, thats me!\n\nIf interested in adoption, the first step is to visit our website chipnsnip.org to complete our adoption application!

Our approval process includes an approved application, reference check, home visit and once approved, a meet and greet with the dog.

We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application.

She needs some leash work but is excited to get out and stretch her legs. She does not like cats. She has a prey drive for them, and squirrels, and birds. She just loves to play with other dogs, big or small. She will need to be crated when you are away because that hound/beagle nose will get her into trouble if left unattended. She will bark a bit but will settle down in her crate once she is comfortable. A solid 5 foot solid wood or a 6 ft chain link fence is a must. She does love numerous long walks during the day. Karlie is on a once a day pill for allergies.",

            "description": "Boomer is a special dog looking for a patient, loving family! He came to Foothills Humane Society with his two sisters in January of 2019.  All three were very under-socialized and had little contact with humans. It took time for us to earn their trust. Boomer was the most frightened and just sat in the corner shaking. \n\nBoomer now loves going for walks with people he knows and has become confident enough to lead, but he always checks in with you. It was pretty scary for him to go for walks without another dog, but he's now mastered that! He has a funny sense of humor and likes to steal his sister\u2019s toys and hide them, but doesn\u2019t mind if she takes them back! He loves to play chase with other dogs and his trusted human friends! He is still extremely shy with new people, but after meeting you a few times he comes around. \n\nBoomer is looking for a quiet, low drama home (without children under the age of 12) with an outgoing dog friend or two, a fenced yard, and people that will give him a little time to settle in and get used to a big change! As comfortable as he has gotten with us, he will need time to adjust to a new home. It would be best if you lived fairly close and could commit to at least 2-3 visits. His trainer will provide 3 free sessions to introduce him and go over the best ways to acclimate him to your home. If you are think that you are a good fit for Boomer, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org.",

Rayna is as sweet as pie too, minus all the sugar and calories. She'll be on her best behavior as she is house trained. Rayna is playful but is also a firm believer in taking naps so adopt her today and have a forever food coma buddy!\n\nRayna is about 3 years old and weighs about 51 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Rayna, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Rayna, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgRayna. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Manny is still learning house manners and leash so he needs a family that understands him, and can give him the time he needs to learn! \n\nDue to his size (64lbs), and his energy level, Manny would do best in a home with older children 12 and up! \n\nWe are told he is good with other dogs, but as always a meet and greet is required before adoption. Cats are unknown. \n\nPlease call or message us to set up an appointment to meet this lovable boy!",

            "description": "Ziggy is approximately 5 years old (born in August of 2016), weighs in at 64 pounds, with a lot of personality!!! He's an awesome guy... big and strong and in need of an owner who will give him the leadership and consistency he needs. He is high energy and needs an active adopter who can keep up with him and has a desire to find ways to keep Ziggy engaged and active. A large fenced yard is recommended. Ziggy. Ziggy would do best in a home as the only pet and with no small children. He does have a high prey drive so we recommend a pinch collar for walking. He's very receptive to training and will thrive with a routine and exercise commitment. Ziggy loves to jump up and say hi to you. The staff is teaching him to sit for leashing and unleashing. He is doing very will and is willing to learn to be the best boy ever!\n\nAdopt Don't Shop!\n\nIf you love the big boys... come to our Palm City facility and meet Ziggy. You will fall in love! Ziggy's adoption fee is sponsored by our wonderful board members. He will also go home with a goody bag donated from Conair. Let's give Ziggy the happy ending he deserves!",

I am good on a leash and have moderate energy. Because I am mature lady I am best suited for an adult only home without other pets. I weigh just over 30 pounds and celebrated my 10th birthday in August of 2020. I am not much for cuddling but I would be happy to curl up by your feet and be your companion. I am a bit possessive of my food and treats so some training and patience when it comes to feeding and treat time would be appreciated. If you are looking for a nice friend to hang out with, I would be a great pal for you. I am a great senior girl and would be happiest in a home without young children or other pets. \n\nPlease come visit me at the Palm City location and we can see if we are a great match for each other. \n\nAdopt Don't Shop!",

Extra large dog beds and Nyla bones will do nicely.\n\nBubba needs to be the only animal in the home as he has a strong prey drive that is natural to his breeding. He can be very strong on the leash when his instincts kick in so he is not suited for neighborhood walks in a busy community where other pets are out and about. No dog parks, no dog beaches, he is happy and well suited to stay home and shower you with love and affection. \n\nPlease call the Palm City Ranch to make an appointment to meet Bubba.",

I have been dreaming of adopting my very own human and now is the time to make it a reality. \n\nI'm about 5-1/2 (as of January 2021) and weigh about 59 lbs. \n\nI plan to take excellent care of my human and I will shower them with affection, understanding and laughter each and every day. I will never chew the remote control like those silly puppies do and I will quickly clean up any snacks that hit the floor - so put that vacuum away - no need for it on my watch.\n\nI need to be the only pet in my home as I do not enjoy the company of other dogs or cats and that is a fact jack, no room for negotiation. I would love a home with a fenced yard and I will have a ball chasing lizards and geckos. I know several commands like sit, down and rollover and I look forward to learning more. \n\nMy adoption is sponsored by Dolly's Dream Project which helps promote us \"square head' canines. When you adopt me they will send us home with lots of goodies!\n\nAdopt Don't Shop",

They have all been happily adopted and now it's time for me to find my loving home. I weigh about 60 pounds and celebrated by 10th birthday in August of 2020. I am sweet and silly and I promise to be loyal and loving friend for all the days to come. I love to lean in to be close to you, ok I insist! I would love to dance with you to your favorite tunes and car rides to Starbucks are always fun too. I am good with dogs of similar energy and mindset. Thanks to our wonderful Board members, my adoption fee has been sponsored. I will also go home with a special Conair goody bag! \n\nI am a real hugger, so come on in and meet this girl. Please call the Palm City Location to make an appointment and come in for that special Lois hug!\n\n\nAdopt Don't Shop! \nSpay or Neuter to control the pet population!",

They were able to catch her and bring her to Furry Friends. All of her babies have found their forever homes. She is currently in a foster home where she is learning to be a dog and being socialized. We feel it is time for her to start exploring her options and to that end we are looking for an understanding, patient and loving home for her. She deserves a furever loving home.

I was born in August of 2014 and weigh 65 pounds. \n\nI enjoy golf cart and car rides and I am happy to enjoy your driving with no complaints. I have plenty of energy for several of us and I am currently working on my leash manners and properly directing all of my energy and exuberance. \n\nI will thrive with continued obedience training and plenty of opportunities to burn the rocket fuel each day. I love to chew so plenty of Nyla Bones will suit me just fine. True to my breeding I am very loyal and I don't miss anything. \n\nI am suited for a home without young children and with someone who has German Shepard or other large dog breed experience. In my prior home I was very dominant with the other dogs in the home. \n\nI am located at our Palm City location.\n\nAdopt Don't Shop\nSpay and Neuter",

I am an excellent cuddler and will make the best companion ever. \n\nI am not a fan of all dogs, which leads me to the question \"do you really like all the people you meet\"? Be honest... With proper introductions and personality choices I do have several canine buddies. It's just about the right match.\n\nI require a special diet due to a kidney issues and I am currently on Enalapril and will be evaluated again soon to see how I am doing. I am approximately 4-1/2 (as of January 2021) and I weigh just under 60 pounds...but that is 60 pounds of pure love to snuggle with.\n\nWe could be the perfect match XOXO\n\n \n\nI would love to get to know you and hopefully become part of your family. As you can see from the picture I love to cool off in the water. One of the nice Board members at Furry Friends is sponsoring my adoption fee. I will even go home with a special Conair goody bag as part of my adoption!\n\nCome in and meet me at our Jupiter location. \n\nAdopt Don't Shop",

When we got to where Winnie was it was obvious she was in major trouble, she was rushed to the vet where she wasn't expected to survive. The vet thought Winnie had been in labor for about 3 days but the first puppy was stuck and had died. Needless to say Winnie had a raging infection and the surgery itself was risky. But Winnie pulled through the surgery like the trooper she is. Winnie has probably never been around people until we rescued her so she is slow to trust strangers but once she does she is a super sweet girl. It took her 6 months to learn to trust her foster mom. Winnie loves to play fetch and play with the other dogs in her foster home. Winnie would do best in a home with at least one other dog and older kids. Winnie will need time to adjust to her new home and new environment. She is spayed, up to date on shots, housebroken, and crate trained.",

She was very interested in the fence. I think she is a bit fearful but more likely was not out and about much in her prior life. I would not rule out having been dumped. She seems to have been an indoor dog. She is very clingy, probably has some separation anxiety. She also seems to be a bit of a watch dog. I left the door from the garage open to the dog run. She let the neighbors know she was there. She is very petite, only 41 pounds. She could put on a few more pounds but around 45pounds is probably good for her. Her fearfulness is not the typical shyness of hybrids, it is simply the fearfulness of a dog that has not experienced much in life. She seems very sweet.\n\nAleu is probably not suitable for a family with rambunctious kids but I do not see shyness in her, just fearfulness. There is a difference. Oh, she likes food. Seems to have had little training. We walked to the mailbox and after a few tugs on the halter already reacted by not pulling as hard. She seems to be a very nice dog. The pictures do not do her justice. She is cute\n\nAleu is not shy, not fearful, just very untrained, probably back yard dog, allowed in house but ZERO training. Most likely was also caught in traffic, very fearful of moving cars.",

            "description": "Coral came to us from Ohio in need of medical care. Her bloodwork was a little off so she went straight from the shelter to Noah's in Indianapolis to get all checked over. She stayed overnight then was released to her temporary foster mom and she will be rechecked this week to see what we are looking at, medical wise. Depending on her recheck and the results of testing, she could possibly be moved to the forever foster status. We will keep you updated on Coral as we hear from the clinic on her condition.10/21 UPDATE: Coral saw Dr. Mark at Noah's last week for a brief check over after starting her medications. She went in yesterday to have her bloodwork rechecked, we are waiting on the results of that and will update ASAP :)11/28 UPDATE: After several weeks of vet rechecks, bloodwork rechecks and being on the right medications for her needs, Coral is feeling MUCH better and her bloodwork numbers have improved!! She will have another bloodwork recheck on December 2nd and if her platelets have continued to go up, we feel that Coral will be ready to find her longer term foster, forever foster or adoptive home!! Once her platelets are leveled off, she will be off of the Prednisone. She will need to be on the Mycophenalate for life. From her current foster mom: Coral is a sweet 8 year old girl (approx) and is around 60 lb. She is quiet most of the time, except when there is food involved, then she can get a little antsy and wants you to share :) She is good at letting you know when her water bowl is empty and if she needs to go potty. She was a little distant at the beginning but as she gets more comfortable, she follows me everywhere and sometimes likes to sleep next to you on the couch. She has some medical issues, mostly an autoimmune disease, she is currently taking prednisone (twice a day) and an Immunosuppressive (Mycophenolate, every 8 hours). Her current routine is breakfast around 7:30am, with the morning pills (Prednisone and Mycphenolate). A cookie around 10am. Some treats around her foster mom's lunch time. Then Mycophenolate around 3 pm. Some treats in the afternoon depending how she is behaving :) Dinner is around 7pm together with the Prednisone. And around 10:30pm she takes her Mycphenolate and goes to bed. She may need to go potty in the middle of the night (side effects of the Prednisone). She sleeps on her kennel (door open) sometimes or just on a bed close to foster mom. She wasn't super fond of the kennel at the beginning but she knows now that the place she goes when foster mom is not in the house. Oh, and she has GREAT time/distance coordination, be sure to watch her treat-catching video!!",

            "description": "Winston\nMale\nLong Haired Dachshund mix\nBorn 2018\n\nContact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com for more information about Winston.\n\nWhen little Winston came to NMAF out of a rural shelter, he had no hair on the backs of his ears or along his spine.  The shelter thought he had some form of skin disease so had marked him to only be handled with gloves.  He was very frightened, terribly thin, but sweet in nature.  An exam by a local vet thought he was actually part Chinese Crested, so that is how we listed him.  In the few weeks since he has come into foster care, with good nutrition and a calm & loving environment, his coat has begun to grow back in all the bare spots.  A second evaluation by Dr. Martin at VCA-Wyoming told us he is not Chinese Crested, so hence his change in breed.  Little Winston has blossomed in foster care - he is a happy and playful little guy (still under 9 pounds but putting on needed weight) and enjoys his buddy Billie a lot.  He is not good at sharing his foster mom and is protective of his food bowl, so if he finds a Furever Home with another dog, his family will need to be aware of that.  We believe he could also be an only dog as long as he can have access to other dogs through family or friends to play with. He prefers dogs near his own size and who like to play.\n\nWinston still needs to be neutered and that will happen on November 10th (vet clinics are still backed up for spay/neuters...), but he could go to his Furever Home before that if his family is willing to bring him for his appointment and see him through the surgery recovery.  He is up-to-date on all shots and microchipped.  He has had his heartworm test and it was negative.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Winston, please complete an application, found at www.nmaf.org/adopt/adoption-application, and email it to dogs@nmaf.org.  There is no commitment or guarantee for adoption, but your application allows for screening before setting up a meet & greet with his foster.\n\nBecause home visits are required, NMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.\n",

He thinks this place is great. He has lots of room to run, a roomie he adores, and all the human pals he could ever ask for. We laugh at Chance when he barks at people from behind his fence because everyone knows he is just a big old mushy teddy bear. He is also very smart and never hesitates to show off his sit and shake skills to impress new friends. He's a very good friend to all of the other dogs that cross his path. On occasion Chance's left ear flops over and it is completely adorable. His new family will cherish this awesome boy.\n\nVisit Chance at www.hua.org!",

It\u2019s apparent that Cliff hasn\u2019t been given a set of rules and needs to be taught most good dog manners. He knows sit and that is currently it. He is willing to learn with some good treats involved! Cliff does tend to pull on a leash, and would be suggested he has a harness in his new home. Cliff will need a confined yard either by fence or appropriate tie out. (Or someone who is responsible to go out with him on a leash every time). Cliff needs a strong leader / owner to learn his respected boundaries. Additionally Cliff does tend to mark as he is not neutered. We suspect this will be lessened or stopped with his neuter.\n\nBreed/Coloring: Red/White Pit mix.\nSex: Male.\nEstimated Age: 1-3 years Old.\nHealth History/Alter History: No Known Vaccinations / Not neutered.\nReason: stray\n\nImportant Information:\nCats: He does have other animal aggression. So no other animals.\nDogs: He does have other animal aggression. So no other animals.\nChildren: We would suggest no children in Cliff\u2019s home. He really needs the work to be the best dog he can be before he could be introduced to children.\n\nLake County Animal Control\nAddress: 3390 Dog Track Rd.

Teamwork makes the dream work as we know. One team one mission is the rule we live by!\n\nOhhh Papa Elf ? What a cute boy and yet not ONE inquiry ? He sits and waits for the phone to ring but all he hears is silence ? We don\u2019t understand why!  Is it because he\u2019s 8? Eight is a great age!  Still lively and fun loving yet also lives to relax!  Papa was pulled from the NYACC in December of 2019 where he was found as a stray.  The city shelter is not no-kill... he just had to be saved!!  Pops is about 60 pounds so a medium size and he currently is lucky to be in a Foster home ?\n\nPapa Elf is ok on leash, he does get happily excited when he sees people so he may jump up to greet you, but his foster peeps are working on that. Once he knows he\u2019s safe, he\u2019s loving and he has lots of energy to play. He sleeps in his crate like a good boy and his favorite toy is a ducky!!  He adores rolling around in the grass and listens to commands. \n\nPapa gets along with other dogs and a proper intro is mandatory to be set up for success!  He\u2019s not a fan of kitties (his loss lol). Mr. Elf will do best in a home that is consisent with rules - he thrives with a strong leader.  He\u2019s neutered, up to date on vaccines and housebroken. He is doing so wonderful with all the structure he now has!! \n\nWhy oh why is this boy still homeless? He matters just like they all do. Do you have a space in your home and heart to make his dreams come true?  Please email us at info@tufftails.org for the full scoopage.

Petey was originally adopted from our shelter when he was a puppy, back in 2014. His adopter told us that at the time, we had warned her that he had baggage, having been mistreated by a man, and that he was unable to forget that part of his life. However, they loved him deeply and worked through the problems he had with males, and showed us that he had learned to accept gentleness and love from all sexes. Petey was loved by his adoptive family for six years, but when the family relocated to a part of the country where they were not permitted to have a pit bull, they brought him back to our shelter so we could find him another wonderful home, back in October, 2020. Dogs like Petey defy the classic mistaken generalizations the breed often garners, and we were thrilled that a family who spotted him on a rescue site visited the shelter, and fell in love. Fast forward to January 30--the adoptive family took Petey to their family vet for a minor issue with one of his toenails, and were told by the vet that Petey had arthritis in his hips, and also has a significant heart murmur. They felt they couldn't give Petey what he needed, and brought him immediately back to the County Shelter for rehoming. Petey is such a gentle boy! He loves babies, children of all ages, cats, and other dogs. He adores women and is most comfortable with women, but accepts males as well, when he is given a bit of space. He is beautifully housetrained-and what wonderful manners he has! He walks beautifully on a leash, and as far as training, he does a beautiful sit, down, gives paw, gives other paw, and is just all in all a perfect dog. He is neutered, current with his vaccines, microchipped, and appreciates love. Of course, more than anything else, Petey will appreciate a home where he can get over his sense of loss, and be given time to adjust to a new routine. Can you give him that, despite his medical needs? We don't expect miraculous cures from our adopters--we want people to love our dogs and cats, and do the best they can for them. Petey is currently in a foster home with cats, two small dogs, a teen boy, and a sweet working-from-home mom!
