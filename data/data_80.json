            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Phoenix! He came into the shelter November 10, 2020 as a stray and was never reclaimed so he is now awaiting his forever home! Phoenix is around three years old, current on shots, and excited to have a  person or family to call his own. Just a happy boy who is filled with joy and unconditional love to share seems to get along well with most other dogs and is super charming. Would do beat in a home with at least 1 other dog. Went to foster care for about a home and found out he\u2019s a great boy just can escape if left alone outside or if he sees something he wants to go check out. A home with a tall privacy fenced in yard would be ideal for Phoenix.  Maybe you have the most perfect forever home for Phoenix? Stop by the shelter for a visit with him today in adopt him into your heart and home.\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

We could all learn a lot from him about rising above because that is what Ron does each and every day. \n\nUnder the loving guidance of our shelter staff, Ron has started to explore the world! He is learning how to sit, make eye contact with his handler, and loose leash walk. More importantly, he is learning to play, enjoy his life, and love his people! Now our special, brave boy is ready to head out into the world and find a family to love. \n\nTo be successful, Ron will need a patient, adult-only family willing to commit to positive reinforcement training, a fenced-in backyard, and plenty of love! If you think you might be the one Ron has been waiting for, let us know, and we would be happy to introduce you!\n\nTo enable us to hold Ron for a meet and greet with you, a $25.00 deposit will be taken at the time you make an appointment.

Her previous owners attempted to treat her skin issues with a chemical of some kind that burned & scarred her back. When that did not work they abandoned her at the shelter. Luckily she came to SCDR & has made an amazing recovery! \n\nIndie has an absolute amazing personality and loves everyone she meets, 2 and 4 legged. She is housebroken, crate trained and takes treats so gently. If you want a dog ready for Netflix and cuddles, walking or hiking, dog bar buddy, baseball games or outdoor dining Indie is the perfect dog for that. A really playful buddy in the home would be a bonus for a girl like Indie!\n\nSubmit your application today at www.southcharlottedogrescue.com!",

Kirby has had a bit of a rough life; he has gone through several homes and had previously been hit by a car. Kirby is not recommended to live with small animals or young children, and a meet and greet with any other dogs in the home would be best as he is picky with his dog friends as well. Kirby`s ideal home would be fairly quiet with a comfy couch to nap on and a backyard to run and play. With some love and patience Kirby will bond with his new people and come out of his shell. Kirby is ready to find his true forever home. If you think your home is a good fit for Kirby, you can submit an adoption application at http://stjoemo.animalshelternet.com.

They all get along wonderful and love to play around in the backyard.   Lennon really enjoys the company of other dogs.   Lennon is even cat friendly!  This handsome dude is really getting used to the good life.  He is enjoying the abundance of toys his foster momma has given him.  Lennon has had some small human visitors and has done extremely well with them.  We think he would probably do just fine in a home with kids. \n\nLennon\u2019s favorite pastime is sitting in the sunshine with a chew.  Ahh the good life.  He loves his walks and is learning how to walk on a leash and takes redirection from his foster mom quite well.  \n\nLennon has lots of energy and his sweet, friendly, goofy personality is blooming.  Whoever has the pleasure of adopting this sweet boy will be one lucky family.  \n\nTo adopt Lennon, visit rescueapittie.org to fill out an adoption application.",

She is the most sweetest girl ever and extremely loyal. Once you get to know her she will steal your heart ???\n\nVixen was so shy at first but she has really come around. Vixen is fantastic on leash and checks in with her handler regularly. Vixen would be a great hiking companion. This girl is so incredibly loyal we have seen some signs of resource guarding her chosen human.\n\nWith some patience and training we know this girl will flourish. Vixen would be good in a home with older children.  Vixen is now spayed and current on her rabies vaccination.",

            "description": "Meet our sweet Henry! What an amazing boy he is, he loves people, loves other dogs and cats.....you name it and I believe that Henry would make friends with it. Henry was brought in from a high kill shelter in Alabama after his owners decided that he was going to get too big for their liking. I'm so glad that the shelter reached out to us, it would have been a shame for Henry not to been here to show everyone how wonderful he thinks they are. We are looking for the right forever home for this great boy to call his very own. If you are interested in Henry or any other dog at NBSR, please click this link to fill out our online adoption application and make sure to tell us who you are interested in.\n\nhttps://www.newbeginningsrescue.com/adoption-application\n\nNew Beginnings Shepherd Rescue is a volunteer based rescue, we work very hard to help as many adoptable GSDs as possible. Most of our dogs come from high kill shelters across the country, so sadly we do not have any background information on them.....but we work very hard to get to know each and every dog brought into our program in need of a new beginning in their lives. We do not take animals with aggression problems (some may not like other dogs, cats, or may require older kids as opposed to younger children, but we will let you know everything that we know) most of these beautiful dogs have been faithful and loving family pets for their entire lives, yet still have lost their homes and families through no fault of their own. If you are interested in opening your heart and home to one of these amazing dogs please fill out our adoption application at https://www.newbeginningsrescue.com/adoption-application and we will get back in touch after we get it processed. If you don't hear from us in 3 days, please send us a gentle reminder and one of us will get right on it.\n\nPlease indicate the dog you are interested in meeting, where it says preference on the application! You may also email julie@newbeginningsrescue.com , we are always happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\nIf you give them your heart, they will give you theirs.",

            "description": "Meet Cassie, she is approximately 12 months old female GSD who has not had an easy life. She had a problem with her tail, where she chewed half of it off and her would not stop. Her owners let her live like this until they were questioned by neighbors, when then they dumped her in a high kill shelter in Alabama. NBSR was called and asked if we could help her and we could not say no. We took Cassie to our emergency vet where her tail was cleaned up and wrapped to stop her from the chewing. When we got her home, she went to our vet and they recommended amputation, we made the appointment and they took off what was injured. She will turn around and look at her tail now, but will not go after it anymore. Sadly, Cassie is not trustworthy around other dogs, she will go after them. We don't know why she does not like other dogs, but you may be able to find a trainer to help with this, just be aware. She is great with me and is very loving to all of us here and to our 14 year old granddaughter as well. Cassie deserves a loving family of her very own, one who won't throw her away at the first sign of a problem like her first family did. Are you her New Beginning? If you are interested in Cassie or any dog on NBSR, please fill out our online adoption application at https://www.newbeginningsrescue.com/adoption-application\n\nNew Beginnings Shepherd Rescue is a volunteer based rescue, we work very hard to help as many adoptable GSDs as possible.

            "description": "Bailey is 8 years old and weighs 70 pounds. She is a truly amazing dog. She is well-mannered, potty-trained, gentle and sweet. She is very loving with humans and even kids -- she would make a WONDERFUL family dog. She really likes to go for car rides and is a great adventure partner. She rarely barks. Sweet Bailey would love to just relax with you and cuddle on the couch or bed and just be with her humans. She is a loyal, affectionate dog. Her owners are relinquishing her because they have to move somewhere Bailey cannot go. She is a really good girl and available for adoption! Her adoption fee is $325 which covers the cost of her spay, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. The first step is completing an application which is available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the below paragraphs for more information on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "Angel came into Lab rescue after being found abandoned in the woods and is completely blind.  She is estimated to be 7 years old.  She had a severe case of heartworms that were treated while in rescue.  She still has a residual cough, but was deemed healthy enough for surgery in September.  At that time she had a mammary gland removed because she had a mast cell tumor (clear margins) and a growth on her chest removed.  Like many of the neglected dogs we get, her teeth are severely worn.  Despite her blindness and medical history, Angel lives up to her name and would make the right family a wonderful pet.\n\n\nThese are some of the qualities she has to offer a family.\n- Angel is smart as a whip and can map out her surroundings quickly. Just don't move the furniture around or put something in her path.\n- She is a very loving, low key Lab who just wants to be with her person.\n- She will let you know if she wants attention by nudging you to pet her or putting her paw on your leg.\n- She's not allowed on the furniture in her foster home, but I'm sure she would love that...especially if she could lay her head on her human.\n- She takes treats ever so gently.\n- She's not a counter surfer and doesn't get into mischief.  \n- She knows \"careful!\", \"step up\" \"step down\" \"stop\", \"sit\" and \"no\"\n- She's good with other dogs, as long as they don't crowd her. Then, she'll issue a warning or try to get away from the dog.\n- She goes on alert when she hears a certain type of bird...ears up, focused attention and ready to head in that direction!\n- Fair warning, she snores!\n\nAngel needs a home where someone is home most of the time and she can be the princess. She truly lives up to her name and is the perfect companion.  Angel has had a difficult life but would love an opportunity to be a cherished pet.\n\n---\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to www.lrrof.org and fill out and application.\n\u00a0\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nTo apply to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida, please visit our website at http://www.lrrof.org. Your support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today.\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family! All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.\n",

            "description": "***ADOPTION PENDING***\nLuna is a bit of a project in terms of socialization and training so her new owner has to be able to commit to continued work with her. We think she's worth it!! She is a loving, more independent dog and is adapting nicely to having a more traditional home situation.\n\nLuna is a smaller female German Shepherd (21\u201d), about 4-5 years old. She has only 3 legs but is not hindered in any way by this except she has reduced stamina. Once she rests up, she\u2019s ready to go again. She loves to be outside to walk, run, chase bugs, and hang out with you. She spends a great deal of time exploring her environment and entertaining herself when outside but she likes to check in with you to make sure you're still there with her. While she\u2019ll stay outside for a time by herself, she doesn\u2019t enjoy being out for long periods of time alone. As with most German Shepherds, she wants to be where her people are. If you have yard work to do, she will love being out there with you! \n\nLuna needs continued work related to excitement level as she transitions to a permanent home. Running around outside or working on training with her person or coming back into the house after running around outside can be very stimulating for Luna. She is learning to \u2018settle\u2019 and to stay back (so that she\u2019s not invading personal space). She has made tremendous progress in her foster home and has learned to moderate herself when she is in high alert mode. A quick verbal correction is all she needs if she does get over-exuberant. \n\nLuna has been integrated with a larger German Shepherd and two Australian Shepherds in her foster home. She tends to just hang out, without interacting, most of the time, but occasionally will take up some play with one of the other dogs. When she plays, she can be loud and growly which does not bother the other dogs at all. \n\nWe think she will do best in a home with one other larger dog or in a home where she is the only dog so that she can get the attention she deserves. We believe her confidence level will continue to improve as her daily life becomes more stable. \n\nLuna enjoys training & she is very treat motivated. She responds extremely well to verbal reminders when a correction is needed. Her new handler has to balance between enforcing the rules and encouraging her. Luna could easily be a dog that learns a dog activity such as tracking, barn hunt or scent work. \n\nLuna is spayed, microchipped, current on vaccinations, & heartworm tested (negative). Luna came to us with a broken pelvis but that has all healed now and her movement is normal. Please call if you\u2019re interested in talking with us about her.  (505) 877-7352. Adoption fee: Please consider donating an amount of your choice to our rescue.\n",

The ideal would be an active and experienced family where he can get enough attention and some sense of security.

            "description": "We rescued Maverick as a tiny puppy, along with his 7 littermates back in January 2020. The litter was born 10/27/19. He got adopted by a nice couple who were first-time dog owners. They reached out to us last week saying that their schedules are too busy and that Maverick deserves more attention than they can provide. We were told that Maverick's father is a Shina Ibu and his mom a Marvelous Mix. The DNA results on his brother beg to differ: 26% American Staffordshire, 14% Labrador Retriever, 14% Chow Chow, 12% Russell Terrier, 9% Husky, 8% Corgi and 8% French Bulldog (Thanks Shelby and Jason!). This adorably handsome fella weighs 42 lbs, walks well on leash, loves to play, is potty trained and is good with other dogs as well as kids. He will do best in a home with a fence yard and and active family that will give him the exercise and attention that he deserves. He is crate-trained, will sit when asked and is a very smart boy.Maverick's adoption fee is $350. He is neutered, microchipped, has his Bordetella vaccine, Rabies vaccine, 1 year checkup and other vetting. Please go to our RefugeRescue.org to fill out an adoption application. 1/27/21 2:50 PM",

(I already know: Sit, Stay, Down, Out, and Get your Bone!)\n I love to play -- especially with rope toys!\n I'm crate trained and enjoy having a puzzle or stuffed Kong to work on when I'm alone!\n I'm available for Foster-to-Adopt!*\n I'm a part of the \"Home Free\" program!**\n\nThe type of home I'm looking for:\n I need to be the only pet in the home (no cats, critters, or other dogs)\n Teens and older recommended\n I need a family willing to work on my training to help me the best dog I can be!\n My on-leash reactivity sometimes makes it difficult to go on walks near other dogs, so I can't live in big apartment buildings or other densely populated areas.\n\nHealth and Behavior Considerations:\n On walks, Audrey reacts to other dogs by barking and lunging (\"reactivity\"). Audrey is looking for a family who is ready to give her the time and extra training she needs. Our Behavior Team can get you started on her training, so you will be ready to help her be the best dog she can be!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Interested in taking me home for a trial period? Please speak with our adoption advisors about how to start the optional adoption trial period through our Foster-to-Adopt program!\n\n**I'm a part of the \"Home Free\" program, reserved for animals who need a little extra help finding their perfect home (and human). These animals are often older or shy, or have medical or behavioral challenges. They still have love to give, and deserve every chance we can offer them. Adopters of these animals choose the adoption fee and can foster-to-adopt to ensure it's a good fit. Talk to a member of our adoptions team if you are interested in me -- and how you can help me find my way \"Home Free.\"",

            "description": "*****STAR HAS BEEN ADOPTED!!!*****\n\nSTAR is a lovely 5 year old sable Sheltie girl who is looking for an experienced Sheltie person/family who is familiar with skittish and nervous dogs.  Star has lived with the same family all her life and takes a while to adjust to new people and surroundings, but is very anxious to bond with someone who will love her forever.  In her foster home, she has declared the man of the house as her favourite so this may be because she prefers males to females....however this may change.  \n\nShe is very good with the resident dogs and previously was a playmate to a Pomeranian. Star has also lived with 2 easygoing,  well behaved cats....which she would occasionally chase.\n\nLike most Shelties....Star will alert you to people at the door or any unusual noises which she hears and will bark when she is nervous.\nStar has been used to sleeping in a crate and she likes the security of her *den* when she is feeling nervous or unsure.  \n\nAn easygoing, well behaved and confident dog would be a good companion for her....in a house without too many comings and goings with people she doesn't know.  She needs the security of a routine and to feel safe in her surroundings.  \n\nStar is being fostered in Niagara on the Lake.\n\n *****PLEASE NOTE THAT DUE TO COVID 19 WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY CONSIDERING CROSS BORDER ADOPTIONS.\n***********************************************************\n\n*****If you have a securely fenced yard and are interested in adopting STAR or any of our dogs, the first step is to complete an Adoption Application at www.sosr.ca/apply-to-adopt so that we can determine whether you and your family are a good match for one of the dogs. If we have a possible match, you would then have a telephone interview, speak to the foster mom, have a home visit by one of our volunteers and vet reference check. \n",

I have a deep bark that might sound intimidating at first, but once you get to know me you'll find that I'm the sweetest boy. My foster momma says I'm very easy going, and sometimes you might even forget I'm there because I'm so well behaved. I love snuggling and getting attention, but I'm also happy to just relax with you. I haven't had a single accident in my foster home either. I love kids, but I might accidentally knock little ones over. When I'm outside, I love to run and play, and I'm still working on my leash manners. I do live in a foster home with another dog. I don't always like to share my \"stuff\" and can be selective with some of the other dogs I meet, so I would do best in a home with another large, calm dog or without other animals. If you have another dog, a meet-and-greet with them wouldn't be a bad idea before you adopt me. I'm always smiling and happy to greet you when you come home. Hopefully, your home will be my home soon!",

            "description": "She is a stout girl with a huge heart, great snuggles and playful energy. She likes meeting people, great with kids and other dogs, house trained and very well behaved at mealtimes. She shows interest in cats without \"prey driven\" behavior and we believe she would do well with a cat that is not reactive (running and hissing) and likes the company of dogs. She just wants to play with them but the cat in her foster home is terrified of her and reacts. She is very good on leash, likes to go on adventures and would be a great running/hiking buddy. She recently discovered she can climb over a 4ft gate to go meet the neighbors! She most certainly needs a big yard and doggy buddies to play with. We are installing \"Coyote rollers\" at the top of our gates to keep her from getting over so please take that into consideration. Meryl will not do well in an apartment and/or without doggy friends. She is a pitty mix and has the most beautiful eyes. Meryl has been waiting almost 3 months in foster care for her furrever family to find her. She is still hopeful.\n\nIf you live in an apartment or are renting, your application cannot be considered unless proven that the pitty breed is allowed on the premises.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

            "description": "Meet Ellis!!! He is a smart, attention loving baby! He seems to have a heinz 57 of some breeds mixed in with him (assumed that he is mostly a akita and Lab) and it is evident that he has received some training as he knows to sit, shake and is pretty good with down and leave it. He is super smart, very puppy brained, high energy, wants to play play play, and just needs some firm boundaries set by both animals and human. He is extremely food motivated and is willing to learn for a tasty treat. \n\nOut of sight is just too far for Ellis and he loves to be at your side at all times. Good luck trying to keep him off your bed! Inches just wont do when this boy wants to cuddle. While he is crate trained, Ellis is still working on being left alone and makes a wonderful telecommute companion (so long as theres lots to do!). Ellis thrives with mental stimulation and likes to work for his food (frozen kongs and Himalayan Cheese are a must). \n\nEllis would thrive best in a home with NO children under the age of 13 (and even those at older ages will need to know dogs boundaries, body language and be very respectful). Ellis would do best in a home with a single man, single woman, or couple that would love an adventure buddy! He LOVES the outdoors, but he doesn't like the outdoors if it means being outside all by himself. He thrives with positive human interaction, playing outside, mental stimulation, and the ability to exert his energy. He would reach his max potential as the single dog in the home but is a great dog park dog and loves having friends. He also is quite the talker as well and when feeling silly he is guaranteed to make you laugh!\n\nEllis cannot go to a novice owner as he needs somebody who is good with training and positive reinforcement. He is currently working on some resource guarding behaviors (toys, kibble, and his tasty chews) but has clear communication through body language. He also needs a home with a fenced in backyard and would not do well in an apartment, condo or townhome. \n\nLastly, our professional dog trainer has also volunteered to give Ellis and his new owner a couple of sessions to ensure Ellis is happy and thriving in his new environment! He is SUCH a special, loving, beautiful dog and truly deserves a furever home!\n\nHe would not do well in a home with cats... sees them as something to chase and antagonize.\n\nHe would not do well in a home with cats... sees them as something to chase and antagonize.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

An avid lizard and squirrel chaser, she keeps herself busy in the yard even on the hottest days and loves to find a sunny spot for lounging. Delilah gets along very well with her foster brother and loves to stay close to him (even when he would prefer a bed to himself). She is completely house broken and very well mannered around the house. She is playful and loves tug of war and fetch and thoroughly enjoys chewing on her dog toys. As she gets very stimulated and excited when on leash, she will need training in leash manners and someone who can dedicate time and effort to training.",

            "description": "Fawn didn't have the best start to life. We're not sure what she has seen in her short year and half, but we know that it has caused her a lot of fear and anxiety. In foster care Fawn is slowly learning to be a dog again without being so frightened. Slowly we are gaining her trust and we know that with some patience, more time, she's going to be the best dog and bring so much joy to one lucky family. She's already such a silly and playful girl! Often, she can be found hopping around the backyard chasing squirrels or running zoomies with her foster siblings. She would do great in a household with other dogs and some room for her to run around in! Fawn is a lanky 35 lbs, cat friendly and crate trained! Anyone who fosters or adopts Fawn comes with 5 training sessions with a professional trainer. You can both learn together and help Fawn find the loving and forever home that she deserves!",

I am a barker, but I'm learning new things everyday. I love to go out in my backyard and investigate things. I use a doggy door and am mostly potty trained. My adoption fee is $250 in the Houston area ($550 out of state, includes adoption fee, transport fee, and health cert) I am neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. I also tested heartworm negative. I have a heart murmur, but don't worry my heart still has a lot of love to give. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptable tab.",

            "description": "Dapper here! I'm a one-and-a-half-year-old pointer mix ready to find my forever home! Could that be with you? Aside from my adorable freckles and non-stop wagging tail, I am a very good boy, but need to go to an experienced home ready to put in the time to help me flourish. You see, I have a lot of energy and require daily exercise (I love to go on runs with my foster family, however, a long walk or hike will also suffice). After getting my energy out, I calm down nicely and LOVE to cuddle up next to you. Due to my energy level, apartment living will not be suitable for me and a fenced in yard would be best. No cats or young children either due to my high prey drive and excitement level. I will need an experienced owner to help me overcome some anxiousness on leash-I pull and can be dog reactive on leash (excessive barking), however my foster family is working with me on re-direction and I have shown positive progress with treats, \"watch me,\" and the Gentle Leader. This behavior translates in the house when I see a dog walk by outside, I get really excited and bark. Again, my foster family is working on this but I'm a work in progress!\nI currently live with my foster family's resident dogs and do great with them, but due to my initial reactiveness, I will need a slow introduction when meeting new dogs. But once I'm comfortable, I love to play and show signs of good etiquette (play bows, \"shaking\" it off). \nI am an athletic dog that could be great in a variety of \"extracurriculars\" like agility, lure racing, or flyball. Aside from my leash skills, my foster family says I'm a real catch-I sleep in my crate, I'm housetrained, know commands, and absolutely love my people and want to be with them (or on them-I think I'm a lap dog). If you've owned dogs before and are willing to put in some work with my training and exercise requirements, request to meet me! I promise you I am worth it!\n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures, and videos about Dapper on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/\n\nAdoption fee: $425\n\nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n\nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n\nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n\nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

We took them all in, and now Lucy is looking for a home to call her own. She is doing well with basic manners and potty training. She is doing very well with the other dogs in her foster home. She wants to be near her humans all the time, and is a person dog :) \n\nShe is constantly trying to cuddle with the other dog in her foster home. She has to always be touching her person or the other dog. She is extremely smart and loving! She is our longest foster resident, and is hoping she gets picked for her forever family soon! \n\nIf interested the first step is to send in an application - www.soardogs.org or shoot us over any questions you have! \n\nAdoption donation required. This covers altering, DAP series vaccinations to date of adoption, Bordetella Vaccination, Rabies vaccination if over four months, Microchip, Deworming, heartworm test (if over 8 months), monthly flea/heartworm prevention to date, grooming, full veterinary examination, and temperament evaluation. Please e-mail us for more information or go to our website https://soardogs.org/adoption-application for an application. Thank you very much!\u00a0\n\n\nAll SOAR dogs go through a ten-day quarantine period to ensure they are healthy, before being adopted. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis, but screen applicants in order to find the best fit for our adoptable dogs.",

Which is very fitting as my foster is always saying \u201cWhoa, Nellie!\u201d\n\nI am a one-year-old and 40 lbs bundle of energy! I have one speed and that is GO GO GO!\n\nMy foster home has a dog and a cat. I love to play with the other dog and will play for hours. I have a lot of puppy tendencies and can be very mouthy with my foster dog sibling while playing. I just get excited! I am still learning good play skills but have to be reminded to take a break.\n\nLet\u2019s talk cats, I want to play with them, too! I sometimes try to get my foster cat sibling to play with me by chasing her but she is not interested. I do respect the hisses and growls. If there is a cat in my forever home, they will need to be dog savvy cat.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk toys, I think all things left in my reach are things to play with. I need some guidance on what is appropriate to play with and what is not. I share my toys with the other dog but prefer to be fed separately. \n\nI love to be outside and sometimes can\u2019t resist an open door. I would love a family that is very active like I am, take me on long runs or walks, and will teach me lots of amazing things.  \n\nI will also need an adult-only family (sorry, kids) with lots of dog experience who will train with me. The awesome news is I am very food motivated and a very fast learner. I already know sit, down, and can almost shake. See how smart I am?\n\nI am fully house trained and I am learning to ring the bell on the back door to let my foster know I need to go outside. I am also crate trained, vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed.\n\nI would love to have a home that will be able to teach me new things, take me on lots of adventures and give me the chance to shine. Is that with you?  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.luckylabrescue.com and complete an adoption application.\n\n",

He has bonded with several staff here, who report he enjoys playing fetch for a few minutes, but then is content to lie at your feet, get some pets and take a nap. If you think you could provide a warm, soft landing for this old timer and let him live out his days in peace, please make an appointment to speak to one of our adoption counselors and see if you'd be a good fit!",

Promise no one else will have a pup with this special bonus feature!!\n\nBert\u2019s around 3 years old, so out of that puppy stage, but young enough to enjoy being active with you. He'd could play for hours, or Netflix and chill with his person. He\u2019s solid at around 45 pounds. Bert loves playing with kids and is great with them! He also enjoys playing with all other dogs!!\n\nBert\u2019s adoption fee is $200. This fee helps to cover the cost of his vetting. Which includes: DA2PPv, bordetella, and rabies vaccinations, deworming, started on heartworm and flea/tick preventions, heartworm test (and treatment if positive), microchip and neuter. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Bert becoming a part of your family the adoption application can be found on our website:\nhalfwayhomeanimalrescue.org\n\nWe do require a vet reference and home visit to ensure that our babies get the best forever home possible.  \n\nThank you for taking a look!!",

Well, a different kind of Foldgers can be there when you wake up each day with this sweet, friendly boy! Foldgers is a sensitive soul who has had a hard time adjusting to all the noises, new people, and other dogs at the shelter. But, with a little time, he has really started to come out of his shell and show his loving, affectionate side. When he's comfortable with someone, he not only welcomes affection, but asks for it. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Foldgers did fine, mostly keeping to himself, exploring the yard, and getting pets from the handlers. Foldgers is looking for someone who will give him the time and patience to become comfortable in a new environment and to get to know them. Then, every day can start with Foldgers' smiling face!",

            "description": "*Adoption Process starts with an Online Adoption Application you can find at www.adoptaboston.com.  Phone interviews do not take place til after an approved application is on file.\n\nEligible for the Golden Paws Program (adoptors 60 yrs and older adopting a dog 7 yrs and older get $50 off the adoption fee noted below)\n\nMy name is Miley.  I am 9 years old and weigh 28 pounds. My owner passed away.  I am being fostered in Lakewood, CO.\n\nI'm a spoiled princess who has been Queen Bee for all 9 years of my life up until my owner died this summer.  \nI'm very sweet and loving, but if I don't want to do something, I won't.  This includes walking on a leash, staying out of the trash, and moving over so my foster mom can get into bed too.  I'm used to getting my way and will give a little sass when I don't.  \nI need a home with no small children or other pets.  I am use to being the center of attention.  I have been around other dogs and do fine for short periods.\nI've also been overindulged when it comes to treats and table food. I arrived overweight.  I lost weight due to a strict diet. \nI have energy and enjoy walks.  Though I pull on the leash which I need to work on, I like walks which help me burn off energy.  Plus a fenced in yard is a must so I can run free and explore.  \nI'm smart but stubborn.  I'm looking for someone who has an infinite amount of patience and can handle a challenge.\n\nHere's a little more about me:\nHousetrained? Yes\nLeash-trained? Need to work on this as I will pull especially if I see other dogs.\nRides well in car? Yes\nGood with other dogs? No\nGood with cats? No\nGood with young children? No\nGood with strangers? Yes\nShy or confident? Confident\nBarks? Yes\nApartment qualified? No, I am vocal\nAny Special needs or Health Issues? Food allergies. Requires a specific diet (24lbs for $45)\nAdoption Fee: $175.00\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered (if six months and older), up to date on rabies and distemper, heartworm tested, and microchipped. Other medical needs diagnosed while in foster care are also treated prior to adoption.\n\nMABTR requires a fenced in area from families who own their home, however we DO adopt to apartment complexes and communities where fences are not permitted due to leases and covenants. In these cases a leash law must be enforced.  We do not accept invisible fencing.\n\nMABTR only adopts to families residing in NE, CO, MO, KS, IA, WY, SD, ND, ID, UT, MT, MN, and SW corner of AR due to the lack of volunteer support in other states, no exception even if you are willing to drive.\n\nIf you are Interested in Adoption please complete our online adoption application at https://www.adoptaboston.com/adopt/application/. Petfinder's form is NOT our application.  We will respond back to you within 72 hours of receiving your application.\n\nInterested in Donating visit https://www.adoptaboston.com/help/",

Already neutered and UTD on vaccines\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Prefers to be out and about with his people but will settle down in his crate after a few minutes. \nGood in the car: Yes!\nGood on a leash: Walks great with a prong, pulls some without it\nEnergy level: Pretty chill (can go from 0 to 100 in 2 seconds, but also the other way around)\nNeed a fenced in yard: Hed definitely enjoy it (he likes to do zoomies).\nDog Friendly: Yes, very playful \nIf yes, does your foster need another dog in its adoptive homes? Not required\nCat Friendly? No, likes to chase\nKid Friendly: Does great with the 12 and 15-year-old in his foster home. Due to a bite history (no broken skin) we wont place Yeti with younger kids.\n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them?\n \nYou might recognize Yeti from our #GRReat68. Yeti was adopted 3 times since arriving from JARM about 1 year ago. But, the shoe never quite fit and Yeti was returned. After spending some time with our friends from Delmarva K9, Yeti is ready to meet his furever family furreal this time!\n\nYeti would do best with an experienced, confident handler.\n\nHe loves his family with all of his heart, but has displayed some initial aggression (bit someone without breaking skin) towards an unfamiliar visitor, so a family (or individual) that doesnt get many visitors is ideal for him. He's fine walking past strangers on walks (no barking, lunging etc.) and has been ok with the visitors in his foster home after a short intro/warm-up period.\n\nHis foster mom describes him as a \"big, happy goofball who is always wagging his tail and wants to be your shadow.\"\n\nYeti knows sit, down and come, and is currently working on the place command which will be helpful when having visitors over.\n\nHes always down for a car ride, walk or some good old zoomies in the backyard and loves to watch out the window (and bark at bunnies in the yard).\n\nIf youre interested in meeting him, go to grrde.org and fill out an application.",

I was rescued from the streets very skinny, scared and heart worm positive by the wonderful people with UnderDog Rescue. My foster mom has been feeding me regular delicious meals and I am looking and feeling much better and I now weigh a healthy 28 pounds.  I am very shy and it takes me a bit to warm up to strangers. I need someone who is patient to help me learn not all people are going to hurt me. I enjoy playing with my foster siblings and am a happy go lucky girl. Once I am comfortable I am a total love bug. I enjoy laying next to you watching tv or reading your favorite book. I am currently under going heart worm treatment at Underdog expense and will need a quite home to recuperate. Won\u2019t you please consider a shy girl like me? I promise you won\u2019t regret it.  My adoption fee if $400. \n\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

            "description": "Meet Lucky, he is a Pit with a lovable and great personality. He is house trained and loves going to explore new places and meet new people or other dogs. He does better with a harness and leash because he wants to say hi to everyone! Lucky loves to run in the yard either with other dogs or chasing a ball - he absolutely loves anything that squeaks. However, Lucky likes to explore - if unsupervised a 6 ft fenced in yard is a must for this boy. Lucky also loves cuddling on the couch and can be a real couch potato at times. Lucky has shown no signs of aggression to any dogs, people, or children. He doesn't do well with crates, we attribute this to his past - he would prefer just sleeping on the couch or being with other dogs. Lucky is a very sweet boy with a ton of love to give, he just wants to share it with everyone and he really deserves a great forever home.\n\nIf you are interested in Lucky, please fill out an adoption application at lastdaydogs.com",

He is SOOOOO cute zooming around the outdoor pens - he just brings a smile to your face. Cody Jack's ideal forever home will be active and fun loving, and ready for a silly love bug to keep them entertained.\nCody Jack can bring too much puppy playfulness to the party for some dogs, so a meet and greet at the shelter will be set up to make sure he is a good fit with any dogs that may already be in his potential new home. Cody Jack would likely want to play too rough for cats, so a cat free home would be best. \nSince Cody Jack is less than 1 year old, he will need to be signed up for puppy classes as part of the adoption process.

            "description": "Have you met Sherman?\n\n10-year-old Sherman was brought into East Valley Shelter LA as a stray, and he became a Frosted Face on October 24, 2020. Sherman is good with other dogs and rotates in several playgroups at FFF. He's such a great hiking buddy, too, as many volunteers can attest to. Sherman is a very popular guy and has been on outings to wineries, coffee shops, pet supply stores, parks, and a pumpkin patch last fall! He is a well-behaved superstar everywhere he goes - even to the groomer!\n\nA volunteer who hikes\nwith Sherman\nshares\n, \"Sherman is such a gentle, gorgeous dog, and his eyes stare deep into your soul. He was a great hiking buddy. Sherman walks well on a leash - he doesn't pull and wasn't reactive to other dogs. At one point we lost the trail down by the water, and master navigator Sherman used his nose to calmly and authoritatively lead us in the right direction!\"\n\nSherman is\na smart, fun guy who knows how to sit\n, enjoys playing\nwith tennis balls,\nand loves snuggles and belly rubs\n. He thrives with mental stimulation and physical activity every day, but he also knows how to relax and appreciates a comfy, cozy dog bed.\n\nThink Sherman might be your guy? Stop by an Open House to meet him!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: https://frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21KG",

            "description": "Elias is an adult male pit mix. This big hoss weighs around 70 lbs. Elias was found as a stray in Spencer County. He keeps his kennel clean and is treat-motivated. Elias\u2019s favorite toys are hard bones. We have had school age children interact with him appropriately and he\u2019s not a big jumper. In a home environment, he is a lovable goof. Elias can be adopted by applying at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

In the end, it was not a good fit for either, and ultimately, we knew we had to give Parsley a second chance at finding his forever home. All in all, Parsley just wants to be loved!\n\nParsley didn't get the proper socialization he needed as a puppy, therefore he needs some work with other animals. Currently, he would do best in a home where is the only pet. He is a heavy sleeper, who loves to make \"dens\" with his blankets. He knows lots of commands, is potty trained, fixed and up to date on vaccines!\n\nAre you the perfect forever home for Parsley?\n\nGender: Male\n\nSpayed/neutered: Yes\n\nWeight: 50 lbs\n\nVaccines: Rabies, Distemper, Bordetella\n\nHeartworm results: Negative\n\nLyme results: Negative\n\nAllergies: None\n\nSpecial needs: Needs slow introductions\n\nOK with kids: No\n\nOK with cats: No\n\nOK with dogs: No\n\nLikes & dislikes: Loves ropes and stuffed animals\n\nAdoption fee: $150\n\nTo Apply:\n\n1) Print adoption application here:\n\nhttps://staffordspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Stafford_SPCA_Adoption_Application_Adoption-Process-04182018.pdf\n\n2) Email to adopt@staffordspca.org OR Fax to 866-522-8042.\n\nPlease see our website for details on our adoption process, and feel free to email with any questions about the process or about the pet you're interested in.\n\nHome visits required and dog adoptions often do require structural fencing. (We make decisions regarding the fencing requirement on a dog-by-dog basis, according to the dog's exercise needs and energy level.)\nStafford SPCA does not condone the exclusive use of invisible fencing.\nWe reserve the right to deny placement of puppies and kittens into homes with children under 5 years old.\n\nIf you can't adopt, please sponsor me!\n\nYou can also volunteer; Get more information at www.staffordspca.org",

When my human was forced to move my brother and I weren't able to go. This nice rescue was able to find a foster home for me to stay while I look for a new family. I am about 75lbs which for my body type is way too much...lol. I guess we were fed well. My foster mom has me on an eating plan and I have actually lost some weight since coming to her but I need to lose a bit more to continue to be healthy. \nI am good with older kids and I need another dog in my new home. One that is pretty laid back and not all up in my face like some can be. A fenced yard is a must for exercise and pottying reasons. I walk well on a leash and actually love going for walks but have always had a yard to do my business. Someone who is home a lot would be great also. I am completely housebroken and well past the chewing stage of life. I also think I am a lap dog. I am a pretty quiet boy but I will bark if something out of the norm happens like doorbell or someone outside passing by. Did I also mention that I LOVE car rides? I will go anywhere you want to go if it means going in the car. \n\nIf you would like to meet jack, send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam\n",

            "description": "Lexi is approximately 7 years old and 86 lbs. Lexi is the sweetest girl and just loves being with people. She loves big, comfy beds and long walks. She enjoys being outside in the warm sunshine. She is a big, cuddly lap dog.\n\nLexi's adopter will need to be within 30 minutes of Adopt-A-Pet Fenton as well as willing and able to bring her back periodically for cast changes.  She is healing from a broken leg and will need to be kept relatively calm until she is cleared by our vet.\n\nThe adoption fee of $250 includes the spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, distemper/parvo combination vaccine, bordetella vaccine, deworming, heartworm test, heartworm preventative, flea preventative, and a microchip.\n\nTo inquire about this dog,\n- if you HAVE NOT previously submitted an application to our organization, please submit one at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AAP/Dog.\n- if you HAVE previously submitted an application to our organization, email us at dogs@adoptapetfenton.com and let us know the name under which you submitted the application.\n\nDo NOT call our center. We usually respond via email within 24-48 hours; please check your spam folder if you don't hear from us.\n\nOften there is very little known about our dogs' and puppies' history or even current habits. We are best guessing on breed blends. We can't guarantee there is or isn't a specific breed in their breed blend.\n\nYou can always expect to do training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. Expect a 10+ year financial, physical, and emotional commitment to this canine. We provide a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this. All dogs and especially puppies are a lot of work and a long financial commitment. Please research what it means to have a dog and make sure a dog is still going to be an important part of your life in 10-15 years. All dogs and puppies need a lot of patience and guidance.\n\nMost dogs who are in shelters will need an adjustment period after adoption. No matter how nice our shelter is and how much attention they get from our volunteers, it is not a home and they will need time to acclimate and get rid of some nervous energy.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Poppa! I'm estimated to be a Pit mix born around 11/26/2016.  I weight around 66 pounds.  I am an energetic and friendly dog.  I'll need plenty of exercise in my new home.  I also am overly eager about my food so I need to be fed in an area where I can be by myself.  I also use a special food bowl that causes me to eat slowly as I tend to just gobble it all in one big mouthful. I love to play and also love to cuddle so I have a lot of good in me too!  Obedience classes for adult dogs and puppies can be incredibly helpful for both animals and humans. It helps you understand what makes me tick and will give me a better idea of what you want me to do. It\u2019s a win/win and it will also strengthen the bond between us! Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

He is a big player and loves a good romp with a larger dog that matches his enthusiasm.\n\nHe may be able to live very happily with another dog in the home as long as the outdoor and indoor space is large enough for 2 big dogs to drain that energy. If there are children in his adoptive home, they should be older than 12 and have lived with dogs previously. He would make a great running buddy in a quiet neighborhood and would not say no to a hike in the woods. Arvin is waiting to settle in with his forever family, is that you?",

She is looking for activity and exercise and would make a great hiking partner.  Tea is not that comfortable with men and we are going to respect her wishes and look for a female adoptive home that has experience with dog ownership.

He has been amazing at his foster home, \"simply a delight\"!  He should go to an adopter with Chihuahua experience.  He may be little, but he can be stubborn and has a big personality.  He has the typical \"Chi\" jealousy and possessiveness over his favorite person, and his spot on the couch.  He may be a bit food/toy aggressive.  He seems to do well with all other dogs.  He enjoys being near his people at all times, he enjoys surveying his entire yard before doing his business, and he does ok with a crate.  Midnight needs a fenced in yard because he loves exploring his environment. He should not go to a home with children, or a home where children may visit.\n\nIf this little delight sounds like he'll make your home complete, apply to adopt today!  He is ready for his new home on 11/20.\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $275  plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

She is a good girl!\n\nHer hair is short and she barely sheds. \n\nShe loves walks and sits very still when you put on the leash. She walks nicely while on a leash.\n\nShe travels well in the car although is a little worried about getting in. \nShe is friendly with people.\n\nShe does not get along with other dogs so needs to be an only dog in her new home.\n\nGlory is food motivated, which has made training easier. She is smart and observant. She knows sit, stay, shake, lay down, come. \n\nShe hates the crate, but is being fed in there with the door open to try to normalize it.\n\nShe is not a cuddly dog, but as she has gotten more comfortable, she is coming over for petting. She usually wants to be in the room where we are even if keeping a little distance. \n\nShe is high energy and is very playful with balls, stuffed animals, etc.\n\nShe can be food and toy possessive. We are working on that, but taking it slowly. \n\nShe needs a family with no children under 12. This girl was surrendered by her owner because she was afraid of the children. She did not harm or threaten them since she is such a sweet girl, she is just timid and small children make her uncomfortable.\n\n\nInterested in adopting? Go on our website, triadspca.org and submit an application or call us at 336-375-3222.\n",

I was dumped out in the country and the cool folks at ARF looked for my family but I guess they didn\u2019t want me back. I am a sweet, young Terrier mix; approximately 2-3 years old and I weigh 23 lbs. I can climb a 6-ft. chainlink fence so I will need a privacy fence or suitable alternative to keep me in and safe, though it's likely I won't WANT to go anywhere once I find my forever family. \n\nI am a very sweet guy and I love people! I have LOADS of energy and will need plenty of stimulation; walks, car rides and tons of play time! Because I have so much energy, I probably wouldn\u2019t be suited for an apartment; I\u2019ll need access to a backyard to go out to play when I need to get some of that energy out. All I really want is a family to love and call my own. \n\nThe fee to adopt Snoopy is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Snoopy, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Snoopy is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Snoopy, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

Feel so much better now that I told you....I love to lick, rub and waller all over my hooman....so there's that too. I'm full of energy so I need someone who can keep up the pace. I love toys and food....which brings me to the next thing I need to be honest about....I'm not fond of my food being touched when I eat...that being said it would be best for me to eat in a secured area so others aren't tempted to touch my food. I do love other dogs....and I'm ready to play at first sight! Come see me soon....I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

He gets a long with all the dogs in his foster home and just wants to play and bum around. Hes a good boy and ready to find his forever home. Dudes adoption fee is $350 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, is NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

Paco is 13 years old and is totally blind. He's a sweet boy just looking for a place to live out the rest of his retirement days. He walks slowly on leash enjoying the 'sniffing' aspect of the walk. A home as an only pet would be best for Paco. We are looking for an adoptive forever home but are happy to have him spend his days in a foster home while we do the search for his perfect home. If you are interested in adopting or fostering Paco, please contact Satchel's at 941-924-5070 or email info@satchelslastresort.org.",

Once I figured out that I'm safe, loved, and cared for, I settled down quite a bit! I learned to play with other dogs and now I play with several, including what could be described by many as a very annoying puppy! She annoys me too, but she's learning, so I cut her a little slack. I'm really trying to just bide my time here, being my very best self, waiting for my forever family to find me!\nKimmie is an awesome dog. She was pretty anxious and hyper when first rescued but she has calmed down considerably and has quickly become a kennel favorite. She is smart and motivated and would do best in a home with no cats. She has done well with several dogs at the kennel.\n\n*** \nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org \n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n \nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

Michael is more outgoing than his brother, but he is shy with new people and takes a little while to warm up. Once he gets to know you, he will come up to greet you with a goofy smile and a wagging tail. He loves to run around outside and play with other dogs, so we are looking for a home with a dog friend who can help him feel more comfortable. Michael will need some socialization and obedience training.\n\nFor more information on Michael, call AWS at 860-354-1350 email animalwelfare.socty@snet.net or visit our website aws-shelter.org for a pre adopt application. Adoption fees for Dogs (8yrs and up) is $150  Adult Dogs is $350 and Puppies under a year is $400 .",

I am not a fan of sharing my goodies and therefore I can be protective of my food so please feed me at a quiet table for 1, away from others. \n\nI am almost 2 years of age and approx 48 pounds. I walk nicely on a leash and love to go for walks and enjoy the sun on my back. When we get back from our walk, I would love to cuddle up by your feet or maybe even on the couch with you, if that's allowed. \n\nCome and meet me at our Jupiter location.",

You would never guess that when you meet this precious soul. All he wants to do is love you and make his person happy. He\u2019s around 4 years old and approximately 60 pounds. \n\nLenny\u2019s adoption fee is $200. This fee helps to cover the cost of his vetting. Which includes: DA2PPv, bordetella, and rabies vaccinations, deworming, started on heartworm and flea/tick preventions, heartworm treatment, microchip and neuter. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Lenny becoming a part of your family the adoption application can be found on our website:\nhalfwayhomeanimalrescue.org\n\nWe do require a vet reference and home visit to ensure that our babies get the best forever home possible.  \n\nThank you for taking a look!!",

Timon is a white & tan chihuahua with green eyes and weighs 7 pounds and Pumba is a toy cairn terrier weighing 15 pounds (he is currently on a diet) They are both 5 years old. These  sweet boys were found running down a dirt road out in the country together. They play together,  they sleep together and are looking for their forever home together.  Pumba is just the sweetest while Timon who is also sweet can be a little more bossy (typical chi).  Pumba loves to eat, loves treats and prefers to be wherever his human is... same with Timon except he has to be in your lap or as close as he can possibly get.  They get along well with other dogs and don't mind cats!  \nThese boys will need a special home together because Timon has a heart murmur that he takes medication for twice a day & Pumba has a seizure disorder that he also takes medication for twice a day.  They are both doing extremely well and are now ready for their forever family.  \nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

Timon is a white & tan chihuahua with green eyes and weighs 7 pounds and Pumba is a toy cairn terrier weighing 15 pounds (he is currently on a diet) They are both 5 years old. These  sweet boys were found running down a dirt road out in the country together. They play together,  they sleep together and are looking for their forever home together.  Pumba is just the sweetest while Timon who is also sweet can be a little more bossy (typical chi).  Pumba loves to eat, loves treats and prefers to be wherever his human is... same with Timon except he has to be in your lap or as close as he can possibly get.  They get along well with other dogs and don't mind cats!  \nThese boys will need a special home together because Timon has a heart murmur that he takes medication for twice a day & Pumba has a seizure disorder that he also takes medication for twice a day.  They are both doing extremely well and are now ready for their forever family.  \nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

            "description": "Diego\u2019s eyes beg you to consider loving him, and if you do, he will love you back tenfold.  He is a 5-year-old Shepherd (mix) that weighs 60 pounds. He responds to the words:  SIT, WAIT, LEAVE-IT, GET IT, BRING IT, DROP IT, OFF, TAKE IT, and TOUCH IT.  He loves pleasing the people he knows and whoever is fortunate enough to adopt him will quickly learn that Diego is waiting to live and die for you.\n\nOne of his greatest joys is playing ball with someone he loves.  He can catch a ball for an hour without getting bored, and afterwards he will cool off in any body of water he finds. He loves spending time outside exploring in our big fenced yards. He thinks going for car a ride anytime to anywhere is a great thing to do. But at the end of the day, he really enjoys just relaxing on a soft spot in an air conditioned or comfortable room.  He is clean in his environment and has proven to be house trained with good manners, in a home he recently stayed in for a couple of weeks. He also enjoyed their fenced back yard and did not try to dig or climb out.  Unfortunately, the people were not equipped to adopt him.\n\n\nDiego has spent time at the facility of one of our trainers (Denise), playing in her big yards with other dogs.  We learned, if there is another dog in Diego\u2019s family, he would do best with a dog his size that does not try to push him around.  Diego is very happy to have canine companionship but it has to be the RIGHT dog.  He knows how to take behavior cues from other dogs. That said, Diego can be too much for some dogs, so he would not be a good candidate to take to dog parks. Planned play dates with compatible dogs would be best.\n \n\nDiego spent one wet day at an adoption event at Devils Backbone Basecamp. Dogs and people were all closely collected in the areas that had cover from the rain, and Diego was very well behaved.  He loved the attention from people, and though he wanted very much to play with the other dogs and would yip and want to go up to sniff and say hi. He was still VERY good at listening to his handlers when told to leave it and settle down.  He sat nicely to greet people and wagged his tail with happiness .  He regularly enjoyed jogging around the perimeter of the site with his human buddy to catch a tennis ball and play in puddles.  He didn\u2019t pull or try to get away as he sniffed, trotted about, and caught his ball.  He had quite the fan club among venue guests but no compatible households for him.\n\nDiego is a perfect match for ACTIVE adopters who can give him regular exercise, mental stimulation, and put in a little time to establish boundaries and reinforce his manners.  He will love to join his owners on hikes or other outdoor activities. Diego has a great foundation of obedience and manners that should transition well into a home.  He needs an owner who will enable him to be his best self by commitment to follow through with his training.  He loves balls, toys water and people.  He\u2019s just a great all-around guy.\n\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting Diego, contact Denise at info@campmerricks.com.  She can set up a meeting away from the shelter.  Diego is selective about the dogs he likes.  He is not good with cats and is too much dog for children under 12.  If you have the right home for Diego, he will keep you smiling, help you keep your body toned, make you feel safe, will listen to all your complaints, will try and do anything you ask, will lie at your feet, will keep you company on car drives, an most of all will love you more than you can fantasize.\n\nDiego is NOT located at the Middleburg Humane Foundation\u2014he is in a Central Virginia shelter 2\u00bd hours from there.  If you are interested in Diego please go to our website www.nelsonspca.org and fill out an on-line application and someone from our shelter will get back to you quickly\n \nYou may also contact Flower at 434-361-0190 or ek.gk@verizon.net to chat about Diego too.\n",

He's good with other dogs at his daycare who are willing to teach him boundaries, but will be too much for a dog with a submissive personality. His current family has invested a lot into training him, so we're looking for an experienced owner that will continue with his training and help tire him out with a game of fetch or a long walk/jog. His perfect home has kids over the age of 12, a home without a lot of visitors (or follow a successful plan when visitors come over) and a person who loves dog training. He loves to play fetch in the yard and crash for a snore-fest on the couch when it's all over.\n\nDOB: 07/08/19\n\nWeight: 45lbs\n\nDog Friendly: yes, does well in daycare and with playful pups who can set appropriate boundaries for him (too much dog for seniors or littles)\n\nEnergy Level: medium-high: needs to burn off his energy (fetch, long walk, jogging)\n\nCrate Trained: yes\n\nPotty Trained: yes\n\nCat Friendly: yes\n\nKid Friendly: 12+\n\nAppropriate for 1st time dog owner: No\n\nTo meet Garth, please fill out an application at http://www.hoofwoofmeow.org/adoption/adoption-application/.

            "description": "Bindi is smart, she knows sit, stay (not to obedience training levels, but well enough to not bolt out the door as you go out), no, drop it, and leave it. She's pretty good at fetching, but not so much at letting go, so it works best if you have two of what you're throwing. She will then drop the one she has at your feet (or close) and you can throw the other one.\n\nShe knows the names of two of the toy types we will send with her. The Kongs are wubbles, and the balls with handles are quaffles.\n\nShe loves peanut butter, pumpkins (we've given her the tiny ones), bananas, carrots, apples, and oranges. Along with standard dog treats, a few pieces of a different flavor of kibble also work as a treat.\n\nHowever, she is afraid of basically everything.\n\nWhen playing if we tell her to go easy she will pick up a toy so it becomes tug of war instead of wrestling, and they've both been learning the command time out. While she and our other dog get along great most of the time, and she shows interest in other dogs, she'd likely do best in an only dog household with no small children. Her occasional overactions are the issue because she takes them out on the other dog. She has never deliberately bitten any person, but if one gets between it's like she isn't even aware they are there once a fight starts and she bites whatever is in front of her.\n\nShe does have a bad knee, but does well with glucosamine.\n\nShe is spayed, her shots are all, current, and she has been on Heart Guard basically her whole life.",

He loves playing in the back yard with his toys and the beach. He\u2019s the biggest baby when getting baths and loves to try and he the water. Zander loves all people and while he has a lot of energy when you first get home and can be quite jumpy he eventually calms down and will just cuddle you on the couch. \n\nZander is not yet fixed and does not like other dogs at all. He can be very aggressive. He would be perfect in a family home with a big back yard with no other animals \n\nHe is hyper sensitive to flee bites and is prone to yeast infections that he has medications for. He has a few abrasions that have not healed because of the sandy Terrain surrounding my house. I\u2019m sure my big baby could make someone very happy \n\nContact Pet Rescue North or Meagan about Zander - His name is Zander, \nMeagan.ns@yahoo.com",

That constant work in progress: always in a stage of making mistakes, learning from the past, and trying to better himself... all rolled up into one little doggo. He is going for it though and handling this thing called life, like the rest of us. Ralph is learning to play with other dogs. He has no idea what to do, so a tolerant female and dog-savvy owner to help him navigate these uncharted waters would be best for him. He is also very playful in the yard with people and toys so he can be a one and only! He loves to chew on his Nyla bones and they really help him relax in the kennel. He keeps his kennel clean and one of his favorite things to do is sunbathe in the yard. Ready for Ralph to put a smile on your face everyday? He is ready to make you smile, so call and make an appointment to meet this goofy boy.",

            "description": "Tootsie Roll is a 6 year old female Wirehaired Terrier Mix rescued as an owner surrender. They could not give her the care she deserves. She was living in a cold building and often got out on a busy street. \n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

            "description": "Don't be fooled by his size, because 3 year old Reggie is a sweetheart.  He came to us  after running loose in Virginia with another dog.  He has learned so much since he arrived.  Probably never having been walked on a leash, our dedicated volunteers tried different ways until he become a pro with a gentle leader head collar. This makes it so much easier for his new family.  Reggie will make an awesome family pet.  Because he is a strong boy, he cannot be with kids under 10.\n\nThe best situation for Reggie will be a home with another dog and a fenced in yard so he can run.  Reggie still needs some time to be fully housetrained.\n\nAll dogs are fully vetted, up to date with shots, heartworm negative and spay or neutered.\n\nTo send in an application and to meet Reggie, please email start2nj@yahoo.com",

I am a special needs boy, who is looking for my forever home I am around 5 months old, my mom says I am a mutt of some sort. They did purchase a DNA test that will tell everyone just what I am! How neat is that?! I am around 15 pounds, and I dont think I will get much bigger, I am a petite guy. My metabolism is out of this world with all of my activity.\n\nSo here is the deal, I know I am cute.. I know you want to kiss and love me but I am just not a normal puppy. I have a neurological condition that causes me to consistently spin. That means I will never be able to just walk into a pet store, or stay out of a kennel when you leave, or sleep in bed with you unless its very low to the ground. Safety is important with my condition. My mom lets me go outside by myself and play with all my friends, they are so much fun. They are so gentle with me and sometimes, I run in a straight line, especially to get back inside!\n\nI had an MRI done, and costed my rescue lots of money..hehe.. well that showed a change in my brain tissue on the right side of the brain. There is an area consistent with bleeding and loss of brain tissue. This is from a severe trauma, I wish I could tell you what happened to me. My doctors and specialist think that my condition will remain the same, with no improvement or declining. I do have loss of vision in both eyes, but mainly the left.\n\nSome of my absolute favorite things to do:\n- Play outside with my friends\n- Poop on moms floor\n- Play with all of these fun toys\n- Couch snuggles\n- Car rides & meeting strangers\n\nI am working on potty training, but honestly I may never be able to be fully potty trained. I do wear a wrap when playing inside because I pee & then spin in a circle creating a sprinkler.\n\nI require a home with patience, and unconditional love. If you think that you can take care of me forever, please email my foster momma > dakota@adoptionfirstky.com\n\n Cincinnati or tri state area\n\n**Please see the videos in the comments**",

Never fear, because he gets around just as well as a 4 legged dog! Cameron is an active boy who must go to a home with another dog who loves to play as much as he does. He tends to get mouthy with kids when he gets excited,  so a home with no kids is preferred. He is house and crate trained and gets along well with dogs of all sizes. We are not sure how he is with cats. A physically fenced yard is required with his adoption. True to his breed, he is extremely intelligent and loyal. He is neutered,  up to date on shots and microchipped.  His adoption fee is $250.00. If you have questions not covered in this bio,  please email projecthoperescue@gmail.com.

Perhaps that explains her shoulder going in and out of joint jumping out of the sink!!!!!. \n\nShe is a very nice pup that enjoys being held. She can not jump off a couch or chair!! She will try :( She needs a quiet home, NO STEPS, and soft bed to lay by her human. She enjoys being petted. \n\nAll of the adults in our program are fully vaccinated, spay/neutered, and have been microchipped.  The adoption fee is $175. Adoptions are limited to within a 100 mile radius of Cincinnati.  Applications can be submitted online at:  https://form.jotform.com/FredsMission/app",

Now he's on medication and staff members are working with him to improve his confidence in people, and he's showing a lot of progress. He greets people with tail wags now and seems much more comfortable around them on his backyard outings. He's also been co-housing with another APA! pup and has done well so he might do well with a doggie buddy. Soon he will be happy to meet new friends! Come meet Butternut, he is waiting for his loving furever home! You can also follow his antics on Instagram @ ohmygourd_itsbutternut--.",

He'll even drop a bone in front of his human friends so they'll toss it for him. Then this energetic, playful boy is just as happy to chill and cuddle with them on the couch. He's a loyal boy who follows his people everywhere. He walks well on his leash, interested in other dogs he sees. And he answers to 'sit.' At home, he may be reluctant to go in his crate, but once there he's content to sleep quietly. And when he's out, this silly boy is happy to chew on his Nylabone. Roan would love a home with someone who can take him for runs and/or who has active older kids to play with. Come meet this friendly boy. He'll even love to do Netflix binges with you!

This little lady does indeed love to snooze and chill for a good portion of the day but she also LOVES to go on walkies and have play time in the yard. When she she is excited to see her favorite human friends or when it is time for breakfast she jumps around like a puppy, barely able to contain her excitement. She prefers to be with people when possible so would do best with somebody who has a more flexible schedule or is home most of the time. She does well with other small doggies that won't jump on her and get too rowdy with her. She is teeny tiny y'all! She would probably do well with older kids that won't bother her when she is resting or be too rough with her. You should know that sweet Bridle does have diabetes. Due to her condition she needs a strict diet of special food and requires 2 insulin shots each day. It may take 2 people to give her the shot. Do you have room for this wonderful lady in your home?

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

He is so sweet and loving, playful and great in a home and out for walks, hiking, shopping, anything you want to do! We have no idea what his combination of mixed breed is  but hes fabulous! \nHe is kind enough to help our friend Chunky Monkey find confidence and get over her sadness when she came to LBWF.\nHe is perfect for the active family or person wanting to enjoy activities.\nLBWF raced to his rescue when we hear about what a great dog he is. The family that had him fell on hard times, as so many this year. he passed his obedience classes at Petco, loved all dogs, kids, super playful and fun, loved hiking and activities and was a wonderful family member, but they could no longer afford to keep him.\n He has a magnificent black coat with multi color speckling,  \nHe loves to play, snuggle, watch TV, go for car rides, beach, restaurants.   \nLoves to play and is so loving! He wants a home of his own again so bad!!!\n Southern Ca adoptions only due to home checks.\nHe is ready to go to his forever loving home!\nUp to date on shots, neutered and micro chipped!\nPlease fill out an application at www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org and tell us why you are the right home for this fun loving boy!\nTo see all of our dogs available for adoption please visit www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org  under the Adopt Today tab.

She is smart, alert, attentive, loving, spry.   She likes to stay close to her human and thoroughly enjoys walks, car rides, sitting on the sofa curled up. She will act like a puppy and will do tricks for treats and loves being spoiled with love and treats. \n\nAs most Jack Russell terriers, she likes to be top dog and therefore will need a home with no other pets or small children. She shouldn\u2019t be brought to a dog park or out where other dogs may run up and startle her.  She prefers her human companion over other dogs.  She is looking to be in a home where she would get loving attention and not be left for long periods of time.  She will need a yard for safe daytime access to go to the bathroom or hang out and get some sun and mostly just hang out with her human.   She is healthy, spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations and senior blood work/urinalysis.\n\nFido is also in need of a foster home.",

I found a foster home that is ready to foster me until I find my FUREVER family. I am really loving my new foster family. I get so much attention being the only one. I just have so much love to share. Are you willing to open up your home for endless kisses and snuggles?\n\n*Update 12/12/20*\nI am checking with my fan group. I have recently been told that I can not live with cats or little dogs as I think they are toys, so I need a home with NO CATS or SMALL DOGS. I do well with polite big dogs and I love to alternate between gentle play, naps, and treats. I also love little humans.\n\nWith all the medical appointments I have had recently to figure out what is up with my tumor, we still don't have all the answers. I have a little bit of a hiccup with my non-tumor back leg so the doctors think that a full leg amputation would not be a good idea as it will put too much stress on it. And the tumor itself can not be removed safely. Thankfully I am unbothered by the tumor and barely notice it, nor does it hinder my daily life!\n\nI will need a home with the understanding that this tumor might be a bit tricky if it keeps growing and what to expect if and when something happens to it!\n\n*New to rescue*\nMy name is Ida Best and I am the best. I was found wandering the streets of Dallas TWICE in the last year and this last time, my family didn't reclaim me. I have a large mass on my back leg and some fur loss but I still am in happy and sweet spirits. I love to be covered by a blankie and I pout when I have my sweaters in the wash.\n\nStay tuned as we get some idea of what is medical going on with sweet Ida Best.",

He loves to be pet, lay in bed, and wants nothing more than to cuddle or chew a bone. \n\nOscar is short, stocky, and all around handsome. This little chunky monkey does great with other dogs his size but has not met cats. Due to being a bull in a china shop at times we suggest Oscar not be adopted to a home with small children. \n\nOscar was recently treated for heartworms and is ready to head to a home of his own. He does take a joint supplement daily due to a luxating patella but our vet has advised he does not need surgery at this time.   \n\nThink Oscar is the dog for you?

            "description": "Tofu is a big 3 year old male Golden Retriever mix who recently arrived in the US from Turkey. He\u2019s been great with settling in and getting acclimated in his new foster home. Tofu is potty trained, knows how to \u2018sit\u2019 and loves to be a giant big lap dog when he gets tired and jumps on the couch with you. Though he is tall enough to reach the counters, he\u2019s been very respectful of not grabbing food. He will bark a bit when new person comes into the house, but then wags his tail and wants all the loving once he realizes they\u2019re his new best friend\u2026and he seems to love everyone he meets. He is a very high energy dog and loves to be outside \u2013 he would run around in a big, secure backyard or go on walks all day long if he could! He\u2019s great on leash with people and other dogs, but thinks squirrels are fun to chase. Everyone that\u2019s met him so far, falls in love. We\u2019re still learning more about Tofu and what he\u2019s looking for in a forever home, so check back for more updates!\n\nNote: Tofu would fit best in a home with children above the age of 7.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting from us, please complete an adoption application at our website (www.fetchinretrieversrescue.org). Once your application is received, it will be reviewed and you may be contacted to arrange a home visit. In keeping with our adoption process, there are no meet and greets with a dog until all steps in the application process have been completed and a potential match has been made. We adhere to this policy because we strive to ensure adoption success between dogs and their new family.",

            "description": "If this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS FOR INFORMATION ON THIS DOG, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON OUR PROCESS.\n\nRobert is around 4-6 years old and weighs 60 pounds. He is EXTREMELY sweet with people. He has not yet been tested with dogs, but has not shown any signs of aggression if a dog passes by the fence. Rescued as a stray, Robert is grateful to have a roof over his head and be an indoor pet. He is crate-trained, clean and well-behaved. He obeys well and knows \"sit\" and \"high-five.\" He is a pretty mellow and low-key guy, but eager to please his humans. He loves hugs and cuddles. He is quite loyal and especially loving. Robert is a truly wonderful dog with an equally lovely temperament to match! His adoption fee is $295 which covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019d like to be considered for adoption, the first step is completing an application which is available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the below paragraphs for more information on our process.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

I try not to brag, but the fact is I am a Gorgeous American Bulldog mix with white hair, blue eyes, and a pink spotted nose. \nI am spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and Heartworm positive - but I'm going through slow kill treatment currently! \nI was born about a year or two ago and was struggling in a rural Louisiana shelter when Take Paws rescued me. Because it\u2019s been a rough road getting here, I take my time to warm up to people, especially men. I\u2019ve got to make sure I\u2019m safe! \nBut once I know I am safe, boy oh boy, will I make your heart melt as I show you the true cuddly 50 lb lap dog that I am! \nMy white coat is no coincidence, because I strongly believe in my role as your self-appointed guardian angel. As your guardian angel, I always want to protect you, and I don\u2019t take the job lightly. This can lead to me showing some serious guarding and defensive behaviors towards other people and dogs. I am selective about who I deem worthy of being near me, because I know what a special girl I am!\n I love long walks and lots of exercise, and I love love love playing and snuggling with my foster siblings. However they\u2019ve got to know I\u2019m the Alpha lady of the household, the big boss. I follow my foster mom around everywhere; I love the company and attention!!! \nI\u2019m an amazing girl to have on your team, but I need someone who will be patient and willing to work with me longterm. Please let me know if that\u2019s you!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

I love attention and delight in going on \t\twalks.  My first days at the Safe House were tarnished because when I \twas accepted I had a good size gash on my right front foot which has to \tbe stapled with a bandage so for the first 10 days I was wearing a cone \tto protect my foot.  That was really hard, but I adjusted and the staples \tare out now. I am totally house trained and LOVE to play fetch!!  DOB \t\t10-4-2019  Come meet me at the Safe House !\n\nAdoption fee $215  Cash or Check  NO CC",

In that home, she was reportedly housebroken and enjoyed sleeping on her own doggy bed in the living room. Remys family decided to have a baby, so Remy asked if she could please come back to PACC so she could find a new home. Babies are not her thing, and thats ok! Remy took a little bit of time to relax when meeting new dogs in PACC playgroup, but did engage in play with the other pooches. Ask about this chocolate house hippo today!",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Marley is an adorable chihuahua/terrier mix who was rescued from southern CA, along with 4 other buddies. He is estimated to be around 1-2 years old, and weighs around 10lbs.\n\nFoster Update: Marley is a very special boy, looking for a special forever home to call his own! Marley was rescued with 4 of his buddies as they were found running the streets of rural CA. Marley was very timid when he first arrived, and it became apparent he hadn't had much interaction with humans or being in a home setting. After lots of decompression, training, and learning to be a dog, Marley has now really come out of his shell. He loves his dog friends, and he will need a canine companion in his forever home. He loves to romp around, play chase, and most of all - curl up on a couch together. He really gains a lot of his confidence with a dog buddy, and it's been so great to see his tail wagging when he has a buddy to play with. He absolutely loves stuffed animals/toys, and is quite motivated by high value treats. Marley also enjoys chew bones, plush blankets, and burrowing.\n\nMarley has done great with his humans, once he has had some time to build trust. He is still quite timid with new people, but that's slowly improving. He can be timid/skittish at first, and needs a human who will not only take things slow but also play the confident role to help him come out of his shell. Marley was able to visit with a few members of our team for a few days each, and it took him a day or two to decompress but then started asking for pets and lap time. He really needs a human who can advocate for him, and help give him a confidence push so that he doesn't fall back into his fearful ways. He will freeze on leash when in new situations, and often try and pull away - it's important for his human to have calm confidence to show him \"hey, we got this!\" and help him move forward, rather than reinforce his fearfulness. He really responds well to guidance and direction and quickly learns, \"hey, that wasn't so bad after all!\".\n\nOnce Marley settles in, he enjoys walks and beach time but doesn't do well with busy city areas/high traffic areas. We are looking for a forever home for Marley with a canine companion, as he absolutely loves having a dog to play with and there hasn't been a dog he's met yet that he didn't love. Marley will also require a home with a fully fenced yard. While he has improved greatly on leash, Marley can get overwhelmed with new/loud noises and would enjoy a space where he can safely run and play. While he enjoys casual strolls, a safe yard to play in is really more his jam. Because Marley is more timid, we are requiring an adult-only home, with preference to past experience with timid dogs.\n\nIt's been an absolute joy to see Marley's true personality start to shine, and for him to show of his goofy and playful personality. Marley is going to make an amazing addition to a lucky person(s) who is patient and ready to help Marley continue to grow and flourish.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

She was sent to us by her breeder to give her the best chance of finding a committed forever family. Missy has UKC papers.\nShe's very smart, and she's a BIG girl! She's also extremely affectionate, loves other dogs, and is a lot of fun to play with. She is full of personality and will put a smile on your face every day.\n\nMissy is able to live with other dogs, but may be overwhelming for me smaller or older dogs. She would do best as the only dog in the home due to her size and breed traits.\nDogo Argentinos were bred to be powerful and persistent hunters of large game. They need to be included with the family, trained, and socialized. They will also require quite a bit of exercise, activity and mental stimulation. Please do your homework on the breed, as Dogos are not recommended for first time dog owners. They can be formidable adult dogs who require their people to have advanced dog handling skills, or be willing to learn. Outdoor only homes will not be considered.\nWe are seeking guardians that will provide Missy with what she needs on a daily basis. Follow-up with training will be required, and will be part of the adoption contract. We do include training with local adoptions.\nTo meet Missy, please complete our online application for adoption: www.deafdogrescueofamerica.org/adoption-application.html\n\nPlease note that we are unable to respond to inquiries, emails or phone calls. Our adoption process starts with completion/submission of an application for adoption. All applications are reviewed as quickly as we can, and our adoption process is not first come, first served. We select our adoptive homes according to what our dogs/puppies require. If you are selected as an appropriate match, you will be contacted to set an appointment to visit the Ranch and meet Missy.",

            "description": "Nacho is a friendly guy and living with a foster who is a first time mal person. He was surrendered by someone who didn't know what they were getting into and had difficulty with training. He knows some commands and is currently walked on a leash. He could use some better obedience training. \n\nNacho rides fairly well in a car but does bark at passing traffic. No cats are recommended for Nacho and older children would be best. \n\nNacho is a little overweight but has improved in that area. He really needs more exercise than he has gotten in the past. Nacho is potty trained. He does not use a crate in his current foster home. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

If you are interested in meeting and adopting her, please submit an adoption application by visiting our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org). Due to COVID19 safety measures, meetings are currently only being scheduled with approved adopters.\n\nVegas is a 2yo Lab/Staffy mix, wieghing approx 56lbs and this mom made a big impression and said Welcome to Las Vegas in a new way for the rescue when she had her litter of 9 mid transport up from Amarillo, TX. Good with other dogs and indifferent about cats, Vegas is a big bundle of love!! She worked with United Paws Dog Training to master her basic skills like sit, walking well on a leash, and all of the other imporant things to build the best resume! She is potty trained and kennel trained but would LOVE to sleep with her favorite human at night! \n\nShe is great with kids and pretty much anyone that wants to give her love. Especially if you will let her be a lap dog! Are you the lucky family to win big with this gal!\n\nPer breed evaluation through Nebraska Humane Society, Vegas does not need to abide by Omaha Breed Specific Laws. \n\nAll of our dogs are fully vetted before adoption, including vaccinations, spay/neuter, and a microchip.\n\nThe adoption process consists of an online application, a vet reference, two personal references, and a home visit. If approved to adopt, there is an adoption contract and an adoption amount. The adoption amount for Vegas is $325 and goes toward the vetting and care of all the dogs in our rescue.\n\nAll adoptions will take place in the Omaha NE area and must be done in person. We are willing to adopt to out-of-state applicants, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must be willing to come to the Omaha area to complete the adoption. We do not ship, transport or deliver our dogs.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Harbor of Hope Dog Rescue, please visit our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org) or our Facebook page. Thank you for your support!",

Upon intake, we noticed that she was pretty sick. Our vet determined that she had pyometra and needed emergency surgery. Well, we are happy to report that she is all healed and now ready to find her forever home. Stella Rose is a happy go lucky girl who is as wide as she is tall. Although her weight is about 50 pounds, she looks like she is only about 30 pounds in person. She is what we would refer to as a baby Hippo. Stella Rose loves all people and kids. She walks great on a leash, knows her basic commands and is pottie trained. She is not really interested with other large dogs (and doesn't like them being in her business but is great in pack walks with them), so we are recommending a home with no other dogs. She does not do well with small dogs or small animals. She is very loving, happy and a very sweet dog. She would make a really nice family pet. Stella Rose has been spayed, is up to date on her vaccinations and is also microchipped. If interested in meeting or adopting Stella Rose, please go to www.LOLR.org and fill out an adoption application.",

With my adorable black and white markings, I kind of look like the cookie too!\n\nHere's a little about me: I love people! They give me the best belly rubs, which is one of my favorite things in the whole wide world. If you give me a little love, I'll give you so much love back. My exuberant love might be a bit much for little children who I might accidentally knock over in my quest to give kisses and get pets, so ages 10+ might be best. I also love treats and toys, and I am house trained and crate trained. I'm also about 2 1/2-years-old and weigh 62-pounds.\n\nMy only special requests are a fenced backyard and a home where I am the only pet. Don't worry, I'll give you all the love you need!\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

She had a padlock holding the chain around her neck. That was no life for her. Her homeless owner loved her much but understood, that Ashanti needed a home where she was safe, could run around on fresh grass and get playtime and cuddletime. \nAshanti is super sweet, she still has the innocence of a puppy and she's very affectionate. Ashanti does well with other dogs and a good companion dog would be a dog her size or bigger whom she can play with and can get her energy out. She's looking for a loving, adult home with yard access.:\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

            "description": "Come and meet the beautiful, resilient Coco Puff! Coco is a 48 lb mixed dog (her brother had an Embark dna test and his results are in her pictures) who was born in April 2020. \nShe is full of energy and loves to chase her ball! She needs someone who is patient because she lived outside with her siblings until she was about 6 months old. She is learning basic commands such as sit, lay down and shake, but still jumps excitably when her foster parents come home and counter-surfs if given the chance. She walks pretty well on the leash but does pull when she sees another dog or squirrel. She has been attending group obedience classes and is perfecting her skills. \nCoco is kennel trained and almost completely housebroken. She gets along with her foster sibling but is reactive with excitement when meeting another dog. She has not been around children or cats. \nCoco is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and spayed. \nAt the end of the day, Coco loves to lounge on the couch and watch tv while chewing on her bone next to her foster family. She may be the perfect addition to your home!\n\n *Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "I was adopted and returned because as much as I love humans, I simply can\u2019t be with other dogs under ANY circumstances.  I need to live in a place with no other dogs nearby (i.e. fence neighbours).  I am happy getting my exercise in a fenced back yard.  I can NEVER go for walks or leave my secure yard in case I encounter another dog.  My lovely forever family forgot this and took me for a walk where I encountered another dog with disastrous results.  If I can\u2019t find a family who understands this about me, GR might have to give up on me and they just don\u2019t do that.  Yes, I am aggressive with other dogs and my trainer says this will never change, but I am a pussy cat with humans.  In fact, I have been described as a big, lazy (with some spurts of energy), calm, love bug and I\u2019m okay with that description as it\u2019s pretty accurate.  I\u2019m really big\u2026180 lbs (so in a way, you\u2019d almost be adopting three Goldens ~ haha).  They call me JC after John Candy\u2026get it?  I hardly ever bark.  I love being touched almost anywhere, but we can talk about that!  I love my food.  You can leave me alone if you have to go out without me.  I am gentle with my treats.  I can jump into the car no problem and I\u2019m good in the car\u2026although you\u2019re not going to take me anywhere other than just for a drive or the odd trip to the vet (which also has to be arranged so that I don\u2019t run into other dogs while there).  I\u2019m not big on toys but I do love hanging out in the backyard sniffing and watching the world go by.  I know my commands and the doc says I\u2019m healthy except my teeth need some work.  I\u2019m ready to find my new forever family\u2026and a calm, quiet family without young children would be best.  Anybody got space for me?  I do take up more room than your average Golden but that only means there\u2019s more of me to love.  You know that baseball terms\u2026three strikes and you\u2019re out???  I\u2019m getting close to that and I really need your help as I have also been a very expensive boy for Golden Rescue to board.  If you can live with my limitations, I promise to love you to the moon and back.\n\nJC is currently being fostered in the Newmarket, ON area. If you would like more information about JC please call our hot-line toll free at 1-866-712-8444 or email adoption@goldenrescue.ca and one of our volunteers will be happy to return your call.",

I'm a 2-year old, spayed, chocolate Australian Kelpie.\n\nI am good with other dogs, tho I can be selective at times so I will need proper intros.\n\nI\n\nt would be best if I was not with children-- an adult only home would be best for my insecurity fears. I am a working dog, so I do not need a ton of over affection and do have a bit of an aloof disposition. I would be a great hiking dog and do best in a home with only 1 person.\n\nI am currently at Partners Training facility---I am getting a specialized, personal one-on-one training program and this will carry over to my new adopters! I will be SO well behaved when you adopt me!\n\nSage's adopter must agree to continue Sage's follow up training, (about 8 visits) with Partners in Cave Creek (free of charge) during the Foster With Intent to Adopt trial period.\nThis way, her adopter will learn the same tools that Sage has been taught with, to continue with her success of being the perfectly mannered dog!\n\nCHECK OUT SAGE'S VIDEO IN TRAINING!!: https://youtu.be/eCrX7bFYgg4\n\nIf you would like to meet Sage, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

Giving birth to 7 beautiful puppies, she took on the nurturing role quickly with everyone she met. Molly is hopeful that she and her puppies will find their furever families to provide lots of love and affection. Molly is sweet natured, but still a young pup herself with loads of energy. She can be active and adventurous one minute and a cuddle bug the next. Will you provide Molly with her holiday home?!?\n \nMolly was rescued by STARS on 8/21/20 after being found roaming the back country streets. Very pregnant, STARS knew they had to get this momma to safety! About a week after being rescued by STARS, Molly gave birth to 7 little cuties who are now about 12 weeks old (18 weeks at adoption even in December). Molly and her puppies are all in search of their forever homes in time for the holidays! \n \nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n \nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations\n \n",

Poor Pip arrived at the shelter with her buddy, Squeak.... unfortunately, Squeak was adopted, but poor Pip was left behind.\n\nShe is not very well socialized with people, and is quite timid. She will need someone experienced with fearful dogs to help her come out of her shell.\n\nAn adopter with another dog would be ideal, as it would help for Pip to model after.\n\nIf you are interested in PIP please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

            "description": "Miss Dottie is an extremely sweet, very affectionate, slightly goofy girl who is learning how to be a dog. She loves meeting new people on walks almost as much as lying down to feel the grass on her belly. She walks well on a leash but like a typical hound, when she smells or sees a critter, that is her main focus. We are doing well with correction and regaining attention. Unlike a typical hound, she hardly barks! She is crate trained for when no one is home and will sometimes just go in it to chew on a toy or bone. Miss Dottie is a pretty laid back velcro dog, but when she decides to get the zoomies it is hysterical. All she really seems to want is the end of a couch to cuddle close to devoted lifelong companions.",

Seriously, can you not see my cute white chin.\n\nI\u2019m a very sweet girl, with a good mix of chilling on the couch next to you and racing around outside.  I\u2019m working on building my confidence when meeting new people and experiencing new things.  Foster mom and I are working with a trainer and so far, so good.  I love my walks around the lake and yummy treats make everything better! I love treats and they make my training so much fun!  Speaking of training, I know how to sit and lay down.  We\u2019re also working on the \u201ctouch\u201d command.  I\u2019m crate trained as well and will sleep quietly all night.\n\nI am also learning how to wait before rushing outside\u2026I\u2019m just so excited and want to chase all the squirrels!  Or I have the zoomies with my foster sister who has helped me be more confident.  I\u2019d love to have a doggie sister or brother in my forever home to snuggle with us on the couch. Based on the things I am training on right now, an apartment may not be my ideal fit. \n\nJade is about 1-2 years old and 30lbs. Since we don't know at all what doggy genes are in the dogs make up (we don't know who mom and dad are!), we are just guessing on breed and size when grown. \n\nAll dogs have had a vet exam, are up to date on vaccinations, have been given a dewormer, treated for fleas and given heartworm preventative.  Dogs over 7 months have been heartworm tested.  \n\nPlease note that because we require a home visit at the time of adoption we can only place animals in homes within a 60 mile radius of Minneapolis. If you are interested in meeting this dog please fill out the pre-adoption application on our website at http://www.safehandsrescue.org under Adopt and we will get back to you to arrange a meeting in the foster home.",

Waylen (2-year-old Pitbull Mix) is a lanky guy who still has so much puppy energy, wiggles, and more! He loves chasing a toy around the yard just as much as he loves leaning his sturdy head into your hand for attention. Well-mannered and gentle, Waylen has shown us that he has all the basics down and is ready to learn more! \n\nWaylen's curious personality keeps him open to new people and experiences, and his forever family will ideally provide him with plenty of enrichment. He has a hip problem that doesn't currently require surgery or slow him down. It is recommended that he is given support through hip and joint supplements. To learn more about Waylen, his lovely personality, and his treatment plan- visit him at the Norfolk SPCA!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 10/15/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Peluche was surrendered by his owners to a shelter in North Carolina. Carolina Poodle Rescue pulled him from the shelter.\nFoster location: Foster Home in Asheville, NC\nSpecial Needs? Peluche is a senior dog with senior dog aches and pains. He had a major dental on 11/10/20 and lost 24 teeth! He has lower cervical spinal disease and is currently receiving laser treatments to help with pain management. Peluche has a 3/6 heart murmor. He is vision impaired. He has clearly had ear challenges. Peluche's previous owners noted that he has had bad reactions to sedation, resulting in seizing and labored breathing.\nWeight: 8 lbs\nHeight: 6 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 - I am priceless\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Peluche is a senior dog looking for a retirement home. He needs a quiet home that will be okay with a low energy dog. Peluche does have medical challenges as described and needs an owner experienced with senior dog care. He is not for a first time dog owner. Given his aches and pains we do not recommend Peluche for a home with children. Peluche will be happy living with other dogs and cats or as the only pet.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Peluche is a sweet old man looking for his retirement home. He enjoys the simple things in life like slow days, long naps and sunbathing under warm blue skies. Peluche enjoys exploring our fenced property at the rescue and hanging out with his buddies. He is good with dogs of all sizes and totally indifferent to cats.\n\nAs noted above, Peluche has a number of medical challenges. The loss of 24 teeth during his recent dental means it's canned food for this boy. And boy does he love it! When Peluche wakes up from a nap he will cry from pain because he is stiff. Like humans, he needs to move and stretch out his back and neck muscles. Laser therapy is helping with this.\n\nPeluche is a wonderful boy. He loves people and loves life (even when it is hard). We know there is a retirement home out there just looking for a precious angel to fill it!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Peluche's estimated birthday is 0/15/2008\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I will sit by you and give you lots of kisses! I\u2019ve got a smile that will melt your heart.  My favorite thing to do is play with toys. I love them so much that I take good care of them and don\u2019t destroy them.  I like to fetch them, but I don\u2019t always want to give them up so I\u2019m working on trading my toy for a treat (and I\u2019m doing really well)!  I also know how to sit nicely for treats.  I\u2019m a high energy boy that needs plenty of exercise.  I used to live with other dogs, and I have been friendly with other dogs in the past.  I am very loved by staff and volunteers, but my dream is to have my very own home. I was born in 2019. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

            "description": "CHECK OUT OUR RECENT FOSTER GRADUATE!\n\n\nPeppa is one of our most recent canine Foster Graduates--unlike our typical foster graduates, this little lady is going to remain in foster care until adoption as a part of our Adoption Ambassador program! Peppa's foster family has been very kind in not only keeping Peppa in foster care as she needed, but also to share photos and words of the times that were shared between them, in hopes to find her a home! \n\n\n\"[Peppa] is wonderful! She minds extremely well, will come when called immediately, is completely potty trained and will not make a mess in the house. She won't steal food from your plate, or get in the trash and is generally very well behaved. She does well with cats, dogs, and horses and will very sweetly approach slowly because she wants to just hang out and be their friend. She gets along great with other dogs in particular and is very playful but if they aren't into it, will back off and be reserved. \n\n\n[Peppa] is absolutely the biggest cuddle monster and wants to be held and to sleep in people's lap. She is a bit dramatic and silly and will flop on the floor and pout if she doesn't get enough attention. She likes to 'talk' and will make howling/grunt noises that sound like a baby babbling and she will have long conversations with herself. She is very energetic despite her limp and enjoys going on long walks and playing with her toys. She is good off leash, even in a forest with a lot of smells and sounds, and will stay by your side and walk along well. \n\nDespite being energetic she can be low key and relax as long as there is a comfy bed or the promise of a cuddle. She sleeps in the weirdest positions and loves to bask in the sunshine and is a great dog, loving to lay on the porch. She is absolutely the best dog and would make a great companion for anyone.\n--\nInterested in adopting? Contact foster@southernpinesanimalshelter.org for more information on how to schedule a meet-'n'-greet or become one of our Adoption Ambassadors for a pet in need!\n---\nPeppa is a 1 year old female Shepherd/Catahoula Leopard Dog Mix. She weighs about 43 lbs. And is HEARTWORM POSITIVE. Her adoption fee is $0. To learn more about how our variable adoption fees are saving more lives than ever before, please visit: http://bit.do/SPAS_Adopt\n---\n*Regular adoption policies and procedures apply",

Before I met them, I lived in a horrible home with lots of drugs and scary people. My previous owner died and left me behind. Some very friendly ladies found me, gave me delicious food, a warm bed and blanket , and a safe place to stay. \n  The experience that HARP has with traumatized dogs has given me the confidence I need to begin learning not to fear the outside world.  HARP says that I should be adopted to a family with dog experience.\n  Sometimes people make me nervous. Calm and structured homes suit me best. Children scare me. Some dogs scare me and others not so much. But a soft voice, kind touch and inviting smile will brighten my day. \n  Once I like you, there is nothing you can do to stop me from loving you. I'm one of the most special dogs in the world if you will give me a chance. I will fill your heart with love.\n  -Belle\nFor more information and an adoption application contact Alfred:\n\n#979-921-0457\n\nalfredk9rr@gmail.com\n",

He loves to play fetch. He is just an awesome dog waiting for his forever home.\n\nThis is what the foster says, She thinks he would do well in a home with anyone that is looking for a calm and polite dog. He needs to be the only dog in the home and he should not be taken to a dog park. The day foster also recommended that Bastien be crated when he is left alone until he gets acclimated to his new home.\n\nIf you're looking for a calm, quiet dog that will be a great companion in your home, come and meet him today!!\n\nAnimal ID Number A4484845. *Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.

He's 66 pounds and really is more on the laid back side. He walks well on a leash and loves other animals. He is a little timid at first, but once he gets to know you, will be your best friend forever. He is house trained too. If you would like to meet him, please contact our shelter at 870-269-5200 or visit him at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas.

            "description": "Lil Homie lost his way home and came into the shelter as a lost dog with ID on Nov. 9, and his family has not come for him. He is a big boy but very sweet, and knows \"sit,\" \"stay and \"lay down.\" He is about 4 years old and weighs 69 pounds. He is up-to-date on vaccinations, now neutered and will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 22 using ID# 625883.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

You would not know it from his personality though. He is the gentlest soul and just wants to be loved. This special boy deserves a loving home where he will be cared for and safe for the rest of his life. Contact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

She prefers women, and loves to snuggle with her human friends. Roxie gets along with other dogs, but would prefer to be the only animal in the home. She would do best in a calm, quiet home without cats or small children. Roxie is a big goofball, and loves to play and run zoomies with her tennis ball. She experiences anxiety during storms and when she's left alone. Roxie is looking for a attentive, confident human who can give her the life she deserves. Contact Pet Helpers at 843-795-1110 to meet Miss Roxie!\n\nRoxie's foster says, \"She's a true Southern Belle -- sweet and gentle, has a smile and a nice hello for everyone she meets. Loves to be social and charms everyone she meets. Very polite and gentle with two legged and four legged strangers -- no jumping, no barking, no crowding. She doesn't beg -- moves away from the table when you sit down without you having to say anything. She has no guarding issues for food or toys. You can leave her alone and she's fine. She likes to watch the world go by from her perch or watch TV. But like every southern belle she has one bad habit -- not whiskey in her teacup or gossiping about the neighbors -- she hogs the couch! I cannot understand how she can still be in the shelter. She is an absolute peach of a dog!\"",

He hasn't stopped smiling since he was picked up from the shelter. Just take a look at his sweet smile! Every day he will show you how thankful he is to be given a second chance.\n\nSaint is a moderate-to-high energy level pup and at times can get a little rowdy during play with other dogs. However, he listens to corrections and commands extremely well. He is potty trained and very gentle with toys, bones, and food. He is great at sharing with his other doggy siblings too! Saint was found as a stray, so it is unknown how he is with cats or small children. He does exceptionally well with dogs his size or bigger though.\nSaint would love to go for hikes, runs or car rides. He would make a great cuddle buddy and would be open for any adventures that come his way!\n\nDue to Saint's unpleasant experience at the shelter, he is working through crate training and separation anxiety. Because of this, he would probably do best with a family who has someone home with him most the day. He would NOT do well being left alone in his kennel all day. But, who would? Saint loves his people. He loves them so much, he just wants to be with them as much as possible.\n\nSaint is an amazing dog and his name could not be a better representation of who he is. He is truly an angel and will bring endless joy and laughter to your life. He deserves a companion or family that have their arms wide open and will love him as much as he will love them. If Saint sounds like a good addition to your family, fill out an application and fall in love with this sweet boy.\n\nIf you are interested in Saint, please email info@underdogaz.com or visit our site for our application www.underdogaz.com",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 10/25/2018\nReason for being in rescue: Cherry was surrendered by her owners to a local animal shelter. CPR pulled her from the shelter.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Cherry is spayed and UTD on all vaccines. She had a dental polishing on 8/28/20. At 16 pounds, Cherry is overweight and needs to lose about 3 pounds. She is vision impaired due to mature cataracts in both eyes.\nWeight: 16 lbs - Cherry needs to lose at least 3 pounds to get back to a healthy weight.\nHeight: 9 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Cherry is a quiet senior girl. She is vision impaired. Given this, a home with few to no stairs would be best for her. Cherry would love another senior dog in her forever home. She spends her days in rescue snuggled up with her best friend Cookie. We believe the warmth and companionship is comforting to her. Cherry is completely indifferent to cats. She would love to be a quiet retiree's beloved companion!\n\nWhat is my personality like? Cherry is a sweet senior girl. She prefers to spend most of her days sleeping. She gets along well with other dogs and loves to cuddle with them. Most days find Cherry snuggled up in a bed with another quiet, senior dog. Cherry walks well on a leash and will follow your voice. She isn't up for long, rigorous walks, but enjoys the warmth of sunshine on her back. Cherry is a wonderful dog for grooming.\n\nCherry is a simple girl looking for a retirement home. A warm bed, another dog to snuggle with, and lots of lap time is all it takes to make this princess happy!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Cherry's estimated birthday is 10/23/2010\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 08/02/2018\nReason for being in rescue: Surrendered to an animal shelter by owners. CPR pulled from the shelter.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Lucy Coco had a dental on 9/22/20 and lost 3 teeth. She also had a small mammary tumor removed. Our vet noted that Lucy Coco has Grade 1 periodontal disease. Lucy Coco is blind.\nWeight: 12.3 lbs\nHeight: in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 - I am priceless\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Lucy Coco is a quiet girl looking for her retirement home. Her dream home has a lap that she can sit in all day long and be petted. She would be fine living with other dogs or cats, or happy as the only princess. Lucy's ideal home has minimal stairs given her vision impairment. This wonderful girl is ready to fill your lap with love!\n\nWhat is my personality like? Lucy Coco marches to the beat of her own drum. She is totally blind and doesn't hear well. This does not slow her down! Lucy LOVES human touch. She is great for grooming and really just wants to be where people area. Lucy is totally indifferent to cats. She will bark at other dogs if they get near her food, but otherwise lives happily with other dogs. She is known around the rescue as everyone's mama. Lucy Coco will spend her days washing and cleaning other dogs' eyes and ears. She is a great girl that will be an absolute jewel for her lucky owner!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Lucy's estimated birthday is 8/2/2009\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I'm a busy body and would do best in a home with working dog experience. Because of my high drive-no cats or small animals for me. I do love my food and because of that I need to go to a home without children. If I sound like a good fixer-upper for you, then please fill out the inquiry for me.",

ARC first took him in back in 2011. We quickly found him a home a month later. Then sadly, eight years later, his adopter returned him to ARC because she was moving. At ARC, we take our animals back for life, immediately and always. Unfortunately, Cold has still not gotten used to life at the shelter again.\n\nColt usually requires some time to get to know new people, and will require multiple visits with any potential adopter. We\u2019d really like to find him a new home. Please consider meeting this handsome fellow today.\n\nI'm not good with:\nMost Other Dogs Cats Young Children Older Children",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 8/24/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Lowrider was found as a stray by a volunteer\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Lowrider has weak hind legs. His back sustained an injury, likely sacroccylgeal, which is causing ataxia and knuckling and loss of continence. This injury cannot be readily identified on radiographs, though we can provide radiographs. Per our vet, not much can be done other than strengthening exercises. Lowrider was neutered and had a dental on 11/3/20.\nWeight: 19 lbs\nHeight: 14 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 - I am special\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Lowrider is a special boy looking for a special home. His back legs have limited mobility. This doesn't stop him for running slowly in wide open fields and living his best life. Given this, Lowrider needs a home where there are no stairs and lots of soft surfaces. His legs will rub raw if he drags them too much, particularly on hard surfaces. Belly Bands will be a must in Lowrider's forever home. He does have some incontinence and leaks urine.\n\nLowrider will be best as an only dog with a family that understands dogs with special needs. He could live happily with cats. He would love children as well. Lowrider does not need a fenced yard. He would love to go for strolls in a stroller. Lowrider is a poster child for living your best life despite the cards life deals you!\n\nWhat is my personality like? Lowrider is a special boy. We don't know what life for Lowrider was like prior to being found by a volunteer, but it involved an injury. At some point in his history Lowrider sustained a significant back injury which is causing ataxia and knuckling in his rear legs and incontinence. Unfortunately there is not a lot that can be done other than strengthening exercises. It is highly doubtful Lowrider will ever recover full mobility in his hind legs.\n\nDespite his physical limitations, Lowrider is a happy boy who is full of personality. He is a sweet boy who loves sunbathing, belly rubs, and being where people are. Lowrider is living in a cottage with other dogs, but can be selective about who he likes. Lower mobility does not slow this boy down if he doesn't want someone in his space. Lowrider will urinate when he gets excited, including if you pick him up. Just be aware when you go to give him snuggles!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Lowrider's estimated birthday is 8/24/2013. This is a complete estimate based on his overall condition. We have no history on Lowrider so his birthday is purely an educated guess.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Duke is an approx 1-2 year old, 60 lb Border Collie/Pit mix (best guess!) who is on Long Island and looking for a forever home. Duke is a happy boy who gets along great with other dogs, loves to play, and is excited to meet all humans big and small. We picture him in an active home, hiking, walking, and joining in on all family adventures. He's a strong boy, so of there are kids in his new home, they need to be sturdy on their feet. His loving can be exuberant at times. (Kids are also required to play many game of fetch in the backyard!) ?  We don't know how he does with cats. Duke is microchipped, vaccinated, and neutered, and his adoption fee is $500. To adopt, please submit an app via our website. www.OlliesAngelsAnimalRescue.org",

All of the volunteers and employees fell in love with this guy - and they meet a lot of dogs! I've been hearing about this fellow from several people for almost 2 months now. Here is one review from today: \"What a delightful boy he is! So well-behaved on our walk, matched his speed to mine with no pulling, nothing seemed to bother him, just a very steady boy.\n\nHe saw a small dog and a Lab from across the street and just looked at them briefly, no reactivity. (Way easier than my own dog!)\n\n\" A Husky that doesn't pull???\n\nRudy absolutely loves the ladies (see photos) but not so much the fellas (before neuter anyway - that may be different now). He's best in a home with female dog family members and unlike many Huskies, probably just fine as a single dog too.\n\nAs with all NorSled adoptions, minimum 5 foot fencing is required. At the shelter, Rudy was a bit of an escape artist. . . who can blame him though? We ALL want to get out to see other things right now!\n\nRudy is neutered, chipped and has his rabies vaccine. Apply now!\n\nPS He LOVES car rides!\n\nIn lieu of home visits, please submit photos/video of your yard and fence.",

She needs a medicated bath every other day and she\u2019s on prednisone for itching. Her skin is healing nicely and her hair is growing back. \nBetty is on thyroid medication. She has dry eyes and needs medicated drops twice a day. We don\u2019t believe she can see much. She gets along with other animals. She\u2019s a quiet dog but will let you know when she needs to go out. Her urine is better after being on a low protein food(natural balance, duck). She was found roaming as a stray and was not claimed. They would have filed cruelty charges if the owners came forward. Betty enjoys car rides and loves chewing on raw hides. Betty is not active. She cannot go on walks. She has one speed which is very slow. She probably has some arthritis. We envision her life on a pet bed barking demands for the rest of her life.  She is spayed, heartworm negative, had a negative fecal, is up to date on shots, heartworm and flea prevention. Shes a very easy going dog. She's perfect at the vet. We tested her for cushings but she was negative. \nPlease email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com for an application\n",

He has exceptional basic obedience, perfect in his crate and can be left to free roam without destroying the house.  He is off leash trained and will recall on verbal and is also e-collar trained.  Although he is fine with both, he should not be in a home with another dog or children because he can play too hard around them. Chipper is incredibly powerful with a 4ft. Vertical and makes the best hiking buddy.   He is eager to learn and as 12 words in his vocabulary.\n",

            "description": "Brady was rescued off the streets of Bosnia in 2017 and has been living in Virginia since being rescued by our organization that same year. Due to unexpected changes in his previous owners' health and living situation, Brady was relinquished back to our organization. \n\nBrady is a sweet chunker who loves chasing his ball and going for walks. Brady is very passive with both male and female dogs and does not show alpha tendencies. He is very strong and can be a bit powerful and pulls when on a leash when he sees someone unfamiliar or another dog/wildlife but shows the ability to be corrected so a family with a strong pack leader would be best. He does not bark much but when he does it is a very high pitched bark. \n\nHe has had recurrent issues with his skin which appears to be dry skin/dandruff. He has been on steroids in the past and medicated shampoo treatments, and the steroids have contributed to him being overweight. His weight can be mitigated with adequate and regular exercise - he has been going on daily walks with his foster family and is losing weight. \n\nHe gets along with most other dogs after being properly introduced and integrated. His breed mix is unknown. Brady turned 4 years old in October 2020. He is over 50 lbs with a medium build. His new home should have a large contained area to run and play. Brady has not been cat tested. His previous home did include other dogs including Lola, his packmate who was also relinquished.  Please view our other postings to see Lola. Brady is currently being fostered near Charlottesville, VA. \n\nWe are a registered 501c3 nonprofit. Learn more at http://www.thetanzieproject.org\n\n",

He acts much younger and maybe we should name him ZIPPY!  He was surrendered because he loves females but not males so we are looking for a female only home. Ziggy cannot even be in a home where there is a male anywhere. Not sure what happened to him but he sure does love the women.\n\n Ziggy weighs six pounds but he is more like 60 pounds of love!  Such a good boy!  He loves to curl up right next to you or in your lap yet he is playful and excited at times.  Ziggy is very trainable as he loves food and can eat eat eat!  He has so much spunk and personality. We haven\u2019t seen any food or toy aggression and he\u2019s not a barker which is always a nice characteristic.  He currently uses a doggy door to go outside to do his business and he learned that super quick! \n\n If you are wanting a companion to love and who enjoys being loved and you are a female, Ziggy is your dog!  Email storkwoods@comcast.net for an adoption application which is the best way to begin a potential adoption.\n\nWe have fosters in several areas of the country. Ziggy is being fostered in TN.",

Muffin was brought to the shelter as a stray and her family never claimed her.  As a result, she is looking for a loving new home to call her own.  Muffin was very shy when she first came to the shelter but it didn't take long for her to come out of her shell.  She is now a bubbly and rambunctious girl that is looking for a family that can keep up.  Muffin is looking for a home where she will get lots of daily playtime and exercise to keep her happy and healthy.  She will also need a family that can help her improve on her manners, especially her leash manners.  She loves attention and squeaky toys.  Muffin is very excited about other dogs but may be too much for some.  She would do best in a home with a confident large dog that can tolerate her energy and roughness.  Muffin must find a home without cats or other small animals.  If this sounds like your perfect companion, come meet Muffin.\n\nAdoption Fee:  $180.00\n",

Thanks to the dedication of one of our wonderful foster care providers, he is gradually making progress and learning the ins and outs of being a beloved pet! Bandicoot's foster family reports - He was extremely frightened when we started and he is still pretty skittish about a lot, but hes slowly building trust and finding some confidence. He walks well on leash but so far we stick to the yard, not quite ready to venture out in to the neighborhood. He is a very gentle sweet pup and has done great with my 5lb chihuahua. Want to learn more about Bandicoot? Email his foster family at jennylshields@gmail.com",

He's a very enthusiast boy who loves to engage with everyone around him. He would love a home where he can be active, be loved as a member of the family and have a nice place to unwind and stretch out those long legs of his. His smile is simply infectious!",

Id been homeless and starved, got heartworms, and was hit by a car. Animal Protection rescued me. The hoomans at the shelter made me well, and the hoomans in the county gave money to pay. My tail wags for you all! Thats mostly past me now. Ive gained weight. The food here is so good to me, and I get fed EVERY DAY! My heartworms will be taken care of soon. My injuries have almost totally healed. Whats next I hope -- is a home and my own peeple who will be patient and kind. They will help me learn that not all hoomans are bad. I grew to love the shelter hoomans, but am shy around new peeple. You will be new peeple to me when we meet. With a little time, Ill come out of my shell with you, too, and love you forever. Im a sweet, gentle girl. I dont understand why hoomans didnt know that before. Youll see my sweetness when we go home together. I dont remember living in a real home before. Will you help me learn how? Having a safe place thats mine alone would be wonderful. The shelter hoomans say a crate will help me blend with the family. I can sleep there, eat there, and get toys and treats there. That sounds so good to me. I hope you make a date to meet me. Fill out the advance adoption form and ask to meet Bambi. I will become your best friend forever.",

            "description": "Do you love the look of a Boxer but really prefer a smaller, more portable dog? Then Casper might just be the guy for you! He is basically a giant Chihuahua but looks like a miniature Boxer. Casper has an extremely expressive face and has a type of permanent look of skepticism mixed with genuine concern. \"\"Are you really going to eat another potato chip and not share it with me? Hmmmm.\"\" \n\nCasper is great with other dogs and has lived in a foster home with lots of other little dogs like himself. He also does well with cats. He's a very sweet and sensitive guy that would do best with an experienced dog owner. Casper has the tendancy to nip those who are unwelcome in his space, specifically people who he is not familiar with and who approach him uninvited. I mean, don't we all hate that?! 6 feet apart, people, please! Casper is a big snuggler and would love to curl up next to you and watch your favorite show (More True Crime? He won't complain!) and help you unwind at the end of the day. \n\nCasper enjoys walks and excercise just as much as the next dog but is also flexible and won't hold you to a strict schedule. Sometimes plans change and a car ride will do the trick! \n\nIf you'd like to meet Casper or speak with his foster mom, please fill out an application at celestialzoo.org, and she can get you more details and set up a meet-and-greet!",

            "description": "DOB: September 2014\nWeight: 30 lbs\nDisposition: Friendly, Charming, Happy\n\nPersonality: Mason is a charmer; he's extremely lovable and quick to appreciate his humans and you will find that he's the most devoted dog ever. His smile is massive and never ending! He's so appreciative of having good care and adventures and his nose just doesn't quite. He loves sniffing out every inch of new grounds...we're beginning to think he's part basset hound. While he has playful bouts, he doesn't need to be playing all the time to be happy and is content just lying around in your company. Whatever mood you're in, he's willing to oblige. He thrives on human engagement and can undoubtedly be the life of the party. Mason is incredibly loyal and needs a care-taker, who will surely never EVER leave him. Due to a disability of his hind legs (his stifle joints fail to extend completely), Mason has a limp and walks mostly with his front legs, but don't let that fool you - he can run very fast when he wants to! He may not be the most handsome dog in town, but the way he lights up and runs towards you with a wagging tail when you enter the room will have you feeling like you've hung the moon.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting sweet Mason, please follow the link to our website to fill out an adoption application: www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below. Your adoption coordinator will respod to you via email once they receive your application: www.thebarkinglot.net/adopt",

All three dog were locked in their home for approximately 10 days with no food or water with their owner who had passed away. They were all laying by her body when the police finally came to do a wellness check. Very loyal dogs, and very protective of their property but they just put on a good act. Once you let them out of their house, they are are very friendly. We will be getting his teeth cleaned and seen by our vet soon. \nif you would like to adopt maverick here is Our Adoption Process... If you are interested in adopting one of our fun loving not so rotten rotties, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that will allows us to get to know you better and to make sure the dog you are looking at is a good fit for your family and lifestyle. You can access our questionnaire by going to our website, www.rottenrottie.com click on the forms tab, and fill out the questionnaire and submit it online. After we review your answers, if we feel that the dog that you are interested in, is not a good fit for you and your family, we may recommend a different rottweiler companion. After we determine which Rottweiler(s) is the best for you, we will set up a time so that you can meet him or her at their house, where they will feel most comfortable and act as they normally do. An adoption contract will be signed to finalize the adoption and we do ask for a rehoming fee of $400 for most adults, $250 for most of our seniors 6 years and above for any rottweiler mix of any age (except puppies) . Our fees for puppies fluctuate depending on how much we had to invest into them or their litter, and weather they are purebred or a mix. These funds are necessary so that our organization may continue to rehome rottweilers. ALL of our dogs are sterilized, fully vaccinated and microchipped, heartworm tested negative and come with a collar and a leash. We have also addressed any injury or illness that they had when they came to us, or received in foster care. These problems will be disclosed to the adopter prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Boo is Small for a rottweiler and has some white on the tops of a couple feet, other then that he looks like a rottie. We are uncertain of his age. We have been told by his previous family that he is 4 years old, however hie looks much older and our vet agrees. Very leery of people. He is scared but has not snapped or been aggrssive in any way. Good with and non reactive to other dogs. He just ignores them at first, then he will follow them around and prefers to be around them. He came to us with Sara and Maverick. All three dog were locked in their home for approximately 10 days with no food or water with their owner who had passed away. They were all laying by her body when the police finally came to do a wellness check. Not sure if he has always acted scared or if he is just tramatized. We just got him and we are still getting to know him.\nif you would like to adopt any of our dogs here is Our Adoption Process... If you are interested in adopting one of our fun loving not so rotten rotties, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that will allows us to get to know you better and to make sure the dog you are looking at is a good fit for your family and lifestyle. You can access our questionnaire by going to our website, www.rottenrottie.com click on the forms tab, and fill out the questionnaire and submit it online. After we review your answers, if we feel that the dog that you are interested in, is not a good fit for you and your family, we may recommend a different rottweiler companion. After we determine which Rottweiler(s) is the best for you, we will set up a time so that you can meet him or her at their house, where they will feel most comfortable and act as they normally do. An adoption contract will be signed to finalize the adoption and we do ask for a rehoming fee of $400 for most adults, $250 for most of our seniors 6 years and above for any rottweiler mix of any age (except puppies) . Our fees for puppies fluctuate depending on how much we had to invest into them or their litter, and weather they are purebred or a mix. These funds are necessary so that our organization may continue to rehome rottweilers. ALL of our dogs are sterilized, fully vaccinated and microchipped, heartworm tested negative and come with a collar and a leash. We have also addressed any injury or illness that they had when they came to us, or received in foster care. These problems will be disclosed to the adopter prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Meet Frito - a handsome 2 1/2 year old, 60lb Pit mix. He is very sweet and cuddly, especially in the morning. Frito is crate trained but sleeps in his human's bed at night, often snoring during his peaceful dreams. He prefers to be close to his humans as much as possible and loves to follow them from room to room throughout the day, unless he is napping on the couch.\n\nHe's a good boy who knows all his basic commands - sit, lay down, roll over, give paw, other paw, wait, come and crate. He's still working on down, especially when he's overly excited. He walks well on a leash/harness but could use some additional training in his forever home since he can get distracted by other walkers or dogs. Frito loves to chew on his bones and chew toys, occasionally \"galloping\" through the house with his favorite toy in his mouth.\n\nWe would love to see him in a home with someone who will provide lots of snuggles, praise and love. Since he's not a fan of his crate, we'd prefer if his forever home used it only on a limited basis or not at all. A house without children is preferred and a fenced in backyard is a plus. Frito is EXTREMELY smart and eager to learn and please his people. He would benefit from an experienced dog owner who would be able to commit to teach him the additional skills he needs.\n\nFrito's adoption fee is $300.

            "description": "Lily is a sweet, 9 yr old blond Pekingese who weighs 16lbs. Lily was surrendered to us by her owners who were moving,\n\nLike most Pekes, you need to go slowly with Lily until she gets to know you. She loves to have her belly rubbed, sleep under your desk while you are working and snuggle with you on the couch during TV time. She will follow you all over the house and happily sleep in her bed at the foot of your bed. Lily is very social with her family and loves to be with her people, so she needs a home where her family is not gone all day.  \n \nLily is simply adorable and has several Peke traits, so she would do best with someone familiar with the breed. Lily can be bossy, especially when she meets new dogs, so she needs to be an only dog.\n\nLily requires an all adult home with a small, securely fenced yard. She is not a candidate for a home with children. Lily is housetrained and doesn\u2019t even mind going outside to potty when it is raining.  \n \nThe adoption range for this dog is limited to NC, SC and VA.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, contact h2hadoptions@gmail.com. An all adult home with a fenced yard (fence must be attached to the home) is required to adopt from Hart-2-Heart Rescue.\n\nThere is an application process and adoption fee. We are an all-volunteer organization, and in addition to saving dogs, we have other responsibilities, so we appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. Response time can take up to 5 business days.\n\nPlease inquire only if you are willing to come to Greensboro, North Carolina to meet the dog after we schedule your home visit. We do not ship dogs or put them on transports. Adoption fee is $400.\n\nVeterinary Care: All Hart-2-Heart Rescue foster dogs are spayed/neutered, current on heartworm prevention, parvo/distemper, bordetella, and rabies vaccines and are professionally groomed. As needed, our foster dogs have teeth cleanings, extractions, bloodwork and other diagnostic testing.",

            "description": "Meet Benson! \nThis handsome\nboy is about 3.5 years old and 70 lbs of love! Benson loves nothing more than to feel safe and snuggle on the couch or lounge around with his humans. He is very sweet and gives a lot of love! Benson is great with humans (kids 10+ ok too) and loves to meet new people. He\u2019s very smart and quick to learn new tricks like high five, paw, stay, sit and lay. He\u2019s also crate and potty trained! Benson was not properly trained or introduced to other animals early on in his life, so he will do better in a home where he can be the only pet. The ideal home for him would be a home with a fenced in yard and a family who wants just one dog. \nBenson has learned a communication system built on rewards and positive verbal markers. This system can be used to continue to develop and nurture his self confidence. Much of his dog reactivity is rooted in a lack of feeling safe. To thrive he will need a strong leader to advocate for him, manage his occasional outbursts of leash reactivity (towards cats/dogs) and to protect him from harm. His ideal match is someone mentally alert enough and physically strong enough to correct and redirect him when he fails to control his impulses. He enjoys affection and praise which can be used as a form of reward. He is crate trained which can be used at times when he must be left alone. He has shown no signs of human aggression or resource guarding but he seems to have had previous success grabbing the leash away from his handler when overstimulated or\nfrustrated. Another reason a muzzle is ideal for leash walking or being on leash in public.  He is not for someone looking for a running or walking partner, or someone that wants to take their dog out to the breweries. He is a sweet human bonded dog that wants to be by your side at home, and will reward you with lots of snuggles and kisses. Benson's trainer has graciously offered to help any potential adopter with transitioning Benson into his new home and provide support. Benson has had a tremendously difficult life but he is ready to find love and support in a family who loves him. Benson was rescued\nfrom a shelter in Los Angeles, CA and is being fostered in Eugene, OR. Will you be his hero? \n\n If you are interested in Benson, please fill out an application at\nwww.streetdoghero.org/forms\n",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "\nColtrane is a very handsome 2-3 year old Self Red merle Australian Shepherd with a full tail, located in Fayetteville, North Carolina. \nHe is UTD on all vaccinations, neutered, current on Heartworm/Flea tick prevention and is microchipped.\n\nHe needs a fully fenced yard, No children under 10 years of age, No male dogs, and No cats or small animals in the home.\n\nIf you are looking for an active boy that still enjoys couch snuggles in the evenings, Coltrane is the best of both worlds. \nEven though he weighs in at 50 lbs, he sees no reason why he can't be a lap dog.\nHe is a cuddle buddy for sure!\nHe is fully house and crate trained. \nWe have been working on basic obedience which he has picked up on quickly and he is very food motivated.\nHe walks well on leash but will still pull occasionally when he gets overly excited. \nHe is a handsome boy that is absolutely full of personality.\nHe loves to shake paws and give high fives for treats or when he's asking for belly rubs. Belly rubs are his very favorite!!!\nHe has the classic velcro Aussie personality and will be your shadow for life. He also has absolutely no sense of what privacy is because he will happily follow you into the bathroom without any hesitation.\nHe loves toys and definitely has ball drive.\nHe greatly enjoys going for car rides too.\nAny children in the home will need to be 10 years of age or older, as small children make him very nervous.\nColtrane gets along great with female dogs but is overly dominant when interacting with male dogs. \nDue to this behavior any existing dogs in the home will have to be female.\nHe would do fine as an only dog too though.\nHe also has an extremely high prey drive so cats and other small animals are a no for him.\nWith his dominance level towards male dogs and the high prey drive, off leash exercise in unfenced environments and dog park settings would be dangerous, so a fully fenced yard is a requirement so he has a safe place to run and burn off energy. \nPreferably 6 ft. high as he is very capable and will try to jump the fence if given the opportunity.\n\nDue to this anyone considering adopting him will also need to take into consideration that he will require ongoing STRICT supervision when outside.\nColtrane also has Coloboma/hyperplasia in his left eye.\nThis is a birth defect to the iris in his left eye which allows for too much light to enter the cornea resulting in light sensitivity. \nTo help with the sensitivity to light we have been working hard on conditioning him to comfortably wear Rex Specs goggles when outside. \nHe is doing really great with them.\nThe goggles are a must for both his comfort and his eye health, as protection from sunlight will help to prevent early development of cataracts.\nAdded bonus is he looks super cool wearing them.\n\nIf you think Coltrane is a good fit for your family, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

I was originally adopted from Halfway to Home in 2009 but in 2018 I was dumped at the local shelter because my family considered me to be too old and wanted me euthanized.  Fortunately the Halfway to Home people found me there and brought me back to the rescue so I would get a second chance to find my forever home.  I am a very friendly boy who gets along great with adults and gives small kisses, but does not do well with children or other dogs.  Admittedly my jogging and hiking days are behind me, but I still have a lot of life left.  Whether it be  a lounging partner watching TV, or going for walks at a park or just around the neighborhood, I would be a wonderful friend and family member.  Senior dogs appreciate love and attention so much and return that love with affection and loyalty.   If you would like more information about me, or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (this is a landline).",

I came to Halfway to Home in 2013 after I was abandoned at the East Palmdale Petsmart.  I'm not sure what I did wrong.  The people here have taken good care of me, but it isn't the same as having a loving forever family!  I am very friendly with adults and small dogs, but I don't do well with children.  I am in very good health and enjoy going for walks.  Chihuahuas are know for their devotion to their owners and I think if you are willing to take a chance on me you will find that I could be a wonderful companion.  Senior dogs are very appreciative of the love and attention that a family brings, so please don't rule me out because of my age.  My size makes me a good fit for an apartment, condo, or mobile home as well as a traveling buddy.  If I have piqued your interest and you would like to learn more about me, or better yet make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (it is a landline).",

I know, you are thinking, \"how can it be so?!\" Well, just look at my gorgeous photos and you will see my adorable face and those fanciful eyes! And you know what else? I'm just as beautiful on the inside and as the outside. No really, foster mommy told me so. I am super sweet, lovable, friendly, and well-mannered; all the things that make me a perfect pup. And Foster mommy says I am the best pup she has had this year which says a lot considering everything the humans have had to endure in 2020. But for me, 2020 has been filled with angels, K-9 Angels. \n\nAs for me, the K-9 Angels have taught me so much, and now I am ready to get settled into a forever home. I would love a family who enjoys giving belly rubs and letting have a few squeaky toys to play with. Oh, and some stuffed animals, too, because I do enjoy pulling out the stuffing. Do you have a spare tennis ball around your house? Well, if you throw it I would love to play fetch with you. I am still learning how to play with other dogs at the park. I have so much fun playing chase with them and getting to know them, and who will and won't share their frisbees and balls. Some dogs can be a little bossy when it comes to their stuff, and foster mommy is showing me how to ignore those types and help me focus my energy on being a happy go lucky girl.\n\nMy foster mommy and I go for long walks along the bayou, exploring the great outdoors. She's teaching me to walk slow and in control, and not to forge ahead at full speed. With basic commands, I am able to understand what being a good dog is on leash. Oh, and those treats she keeps in her pocket help let me know I am doing a good job.\n\nAnd speaking of training, my foster mommy has taught me to sit and wait to be called for mealtime. I am such a smart pup. My favorite time of the day is snuggle time. Foster mama let's me snuggle with her on the couch and we watch TV together. Her head makes a perfect pillow. She says I snore so cutely, but I've never heard it so I think she is lying. \n\nSo now that you are totally in love with me and are frantically working on your application, here are a few details to think about: I am good with dogs that are willing to share toys and are not an alpha female. I can play a little rough with big dogs like me (though I am learning how to be gentler) and it might be best if I am in a house with dogs who won't mind a little rough housing. As for cats, I am very curious about the ones I've seen around the neighborhood but don't have any experience one on one with them. I haven't been around kids but we could schedule a meet up and see how things go!\n\nSo get your application filled out, because I know I am going to be pretty popular after all the families out there read my impressive bio. Oh, and by the way, I am totally housetrained. \n\nRobyn is a female Shepherd/Black Mouth Cur mix who weighs 46 lbs and was born 10/3/2018.",

            "description": "Lorelei is a 2-year-old brindle beauty with sweet, expressive eyes who came to us from our rescue partners in Tennessee with her 6 puppies (who were quickly adopted out). She was found as a stray and likely had a difficult past that is apparent in her distrust of people in general, but especially men. \n\nLorelei is very high energy and loves to spend her time playing with any animal that will run and wrestle with her. She likes other dogs but can be very dominant so would do best with more submissive doggie friends. Surprisingly enough, she is very sweet to cats, but is not a fan of children so would need to go to a home without children. \n\nShe is a sweet girl who needs a chance to see that life and people can be pretty nice. Once she feels comfortable with you, she is a very cuddly and affectionate dog. She would love an active family that will take her on adventures during the day then settle on the couch for snuggles at night! She is an angel in her crate and catches onto commands quickly. If you would like to meet Lorelei, please fill out a survey today at https://www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey\n",

Gus will go just about anywhere with his person on the other end of the leash. He is very calm and enjoys meandering walks. He seems picky about his male dog friends but does okay with females and does fine with kids too. When he first meets you, he turns into all wiggles and smiles. We would love to help Gus find his forever person that he can meander and adventure with! Ask us about how to meet this cool guy today.\nPlease stop by the City of Jackson Animal Shelter at 140 Outer Circle, Jackson, MS during their adoption hr (10 - 4 M - F and 8:30-10:30 Sat) to meet Gus and take a leash with you so that you can take him outside for a walk and get to know him a little better.  For more information, please contact Linda (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone (601.502.5339) or email (lctemp64@outlook.com). Gus is eligible for a free neuter thru Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter.  For more pictures and information, please take a look at our Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter page on Facebook.",

I am high-energy with an impressive vertical leap. I bark when I see people I don't know.  I am very particular about who can pick me up, and although I am not large, I am definitely in charge!   I am not house-trained, and I don't do well with children.  Why should you adopt me, you ask?  Well, despite my faults, I think I could be a fun and entertaining addition to the right family.   I  need a firm, but patient adult-only family who is willing to take the time to work with me and show me where to potty and how to walk on a leash.  Obedience training will help with the bonding process and help me reach my potential to be a well-behaved boy and a good companion. My size makes me  a great fit for an apartment, condo, or mobile home. I do well with other small dogs as long as they understand that I am the boss.   Are you ready to take the Romeo challenge?  If you are, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495.  I'll be waiting!!",

These two are very easy going and chill. It can be intimidating to adopt 2 dogs at the same time but with these 2 you wouldn't even notice! \n\nYOU CAN FOLLOW THEM ON IG: \nKali_n_Cruz_BondedPair\n\nTheir Story:\nCruz was adopted from our rescue 3 years ago and his adoptive family returned him due to them going through a separation recently and neither could keep him or his sister (Kali). They were going to send her to the shelter and we weren't going to let the happen since these two are inseparable as you can see in the pictures! They had 2 other siblings, 1 large sister and 1 small sister which were kept by family members. They get along with all other size dogs as long as introduced properly. \n\nMeet this dynamic duo, Cruz & Kali!! They are the absolute sweetest and loving dogs you could meet. \n\nCruz is a male brindle pittie mix.  He's about 4-5 years old and is a medium size dog weighing approx. 40-50 lbs. He is timid at first but will warm right up once he realizes he'll get attention. \n\nKali is a female white & grey pittie/possible bulldog mix. She's about 8-10 years old and is a large dog weighing approx. 90-100 lbs. Kali follows Cruz everywhere, she's like the little big sister. \n\nThey love cuddling up with each other or with their humans. They are inside dogs only, they don't like being out in the cold (only to potty). They really like to hang out with their humans so they'd like to go to a home where they will spend a lot of time with their family but if needed can go in a kennel when nobody is home. They both like to play with their toys and run around. These two really like attention, especially Cruz, he will always try to get some lovin'.  They also like to go on walks. \n\nIf you're interested in getting more information, pictures, or meeting these 2 squishy faces please email us at findingabestfriend@gmail.com or you can text their foster mom directly at 209-298-2433. They are located in Stockton. \n\nAny current animal in the home must be altered and up to date on vaccines. \n\nIf you meet these two you'll fall right in love! \n\nThank you for your interest!",

I have been at Halfway to Home since 2011.  I appreciate all the love I have received from the people here, but I would also love to find a forever adult-only family to love for the rest of my life.    I am a sweet  and playful boy who loves being around people, although admittedly I am not fond of being picked up.  I prefer to chug around and check out what is going on around me.  I am deaf so getting my attention can sometimes be a challenge but I am able to feel vibration so a good foot stomp will usually do the trick.  I also have some arthritis in my front legs but it doesn't prevent me from exploring!   Senior dogs are wonderful family members because we appreciate lots of love and attention and will respond in kind.  I know there is a nice person or couple out there who would enjoy my company.    I get along well with other small dogs too!  If you would like more information about me, or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (it is a landline).  Thank you for reading about me and I hope to meet you soon!!",

He was quite fearful of strangers and he still is quite shy around strangers, but give him a chance to get to know you and he turn into an absolute love bug!\nBaxter's at that perfect age where he still has lots of energy to run and play. He loves to run, and go for rides in the car, and walks well on a leash, but he's also content to lay around and nap most of the day away.\n\nGiven Baxter's timid nature, he'll do best in a relatively quiet home (no small children). He gets along great with well-mannered cats\nand dogs.\n\nHe would be most happy in a home with another confident animal to show him that everything will be OK.\n\nBaxter's potential new home would have to be within 30 - 45 minutes of driving distance of Fountain Hills because his adoption process would include multiple visits of Baxter with his foster mom to his potential new home to make sure he is comfortable there.\n\nBaxter is currently in a foster home\n\nBaxter is up to date on his vaccines, neutered and microchipped\n\n1/15/21 3:54 PM",

This 8 year old Yorkie mix comes to us as an owner surrender meaning she is already leash trained, potty trained and has her own routines. Bianca responds to basic commands like stop, sit, and come, and loves to play with squeaky toys, especially balls (balls of all kind). While she is sweet and lovable 99% of the time, B does have a bite history according to her previous owners. We have witnessed her become aggressive with sudden gestures like opening doors, but she calms down after a moment or two. At that point we redirect her attention with treats (she is food motivated). \n\nFor these reasons, we recommend an experienced adopter who lives alone and is patient with no kids or other pets at home. \n\n*Please note she has seen an animal behaviorist. \n\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Bianca? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Bianca.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Bianca the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

I have been at Halfway to Home dog rescue since 2011, and the people here have been wonderful to me.  However, I am ready to find the forever home I deserve with a loving adult-only family.  I am a very friendly boy and always greet people with a waggy tail.  I am not exactly a lapdog but I love to sit right next to my people while they pet me and will follow you around if you don't mind.  I may also want to sleep with you.  I am partially-blind but still able to run around and play, and I rarely bark.  I would enjoy going for daily walks for exercise and walk well on a leash.   I am not a good fit for kids because of my sight-challenges and age, but other small dogs would be wonderful for playmates.  Please don't let my age discourage you.  Senior dogs make wonderful companions and appreciate love and attention more than anything else.  I hope you will consider me to join your family.  If interested in more information about me, or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at 661-824-4495 (this is a landline).",

Little ones just make her nervous.  \n\nBentley would love a quiet home with a fenced in back yard so she can play ball and a deck where she can sunbathe!   Bentley also loves to go for car rides with the volunteers and enjoys catching some z's perched on the back of the couch.  \n\nDo you have room in your heart and your home for this sweet gal?

            "description": "Please read the bio in full for answers to your questions. In the event you have a question that is not covered in the bio, please email info@seniordoghaven.org. If interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application which can be found at www.seniordoghaven.org under the Adoption Process tab. Please note that because all of our dogs live in foster homes, we are unable to set up meetings with a dog unless we have a completed adoption application on file. Adoptions must be about an hour of Wilmington, DE in order for our volunteers to be able to conduct an in person home visit. \n\nJack and Jill are 8 year old brother and sister siblings who originally came to us by way of a local SPCA where they were surrendered because their owner had too many dogs in the house.  They were not socialized at all and hid wherever possible when we first took them in so they have spent 5 months in a foster home learning how to trust.\n\nThese two have sure had their share of maladies while with us!    Both had extremely high white blood cell counts of unknown origin, which are now finally back to normal.  Both were also morbidly obese, Jack was over 20 pounds and Jill was over 18 pounds when they should be more like 10-12 pounds at most.   Because they seem to have a very low metabolism and gain weight on standard dog food, they have been on a strict home cooked diet for the past 4 months and are now down to 12 pounds (Jack) and 12.5 pounds (Jill).   Their new family will need to ensure that they are kept on a diet that will not cause them to gain weight.  Especially because Jack had a very high grade luxating patella on one of his back legs which required knee surgery and does have a mild luxating patella in the other back leg so any extra weight will be detrimental to his knee.    They have both been doing well on Hills Metabolic Support Food and Just Food For Dogs Metabolic support food so they don't necessarily need home cooked food any more now that they are at a more optimal weight. \n\nJack and Jill are still on the shy side when you first meet them.    It will take them some time to warm up and trust people therefore we will be looking for a  quiet home for them without children who can be patient and give them the time that they need to adjust and trust.   Jack warms up much faster than Jill and will roll over for belly rubs quickly.  Jill, on the other hand, is much more scared and reserved.  They are so scared of the world outside of their foster home that they do not walk on leash or go outside of their back yard and probably never will so they will need a secure fenced in yard for potty breaks and a bit of exercise.  Speaking of potty breaks, neither Jack or Jill are fully housebroken and will need a family that can get them on a regular potty schedule and work with them on house training.  They do use pee pads in their foster home and Jack would much prefer to use pee pads and typically needs to be carried outside to do his business.   Both dogs need to be kept outside for enough time to do their business since they tend to run inside too quickly and end up using pee pads.  \n\nJill is extremely protective of Jack so we feel is it best for them to be the only dogs in the house.  Jill gets a little cranky towards Jack like siblings do and they do have short minor spats with each other.  We originally thought that maybe it would be best to separate them but neither do well without the other so we assume Jack is just so used to his sister telling him what to do, that he is lost without her.  \n\nBoth love sitting with their foster family at night and enjoying belly rubs.  They would love sleeping next to their family as well but haven\u2019t been able to very much because of other dogs in the household.   Because they can\u2019t get full one on one time with their foster family right because of other dogs in the household, we can\u2019t wait for them to be able to enjoy their family all of the time!   \nWe know that we are asking a lot of a family for them, but we know they deserve it and we know that the perfect family is out there waiting for them!  \n\n",

She is stunning, a sweetheart and is good with other dogs and all kids. She will need some time and patience to adjust to adult males in the home; she has a fear and will tuck her tail and bark, but is not aggressive in any way, just wants her space until she is sure they are ok. She is great with females and will be their best friend. She is a quiet dog otherwise who likes to curl up and keep watch. She knows sit and understands no well. She has been around a cat and has adjusted after some time in the foster home with it. Shasta is best suited for a family home, not appropriate for apartment living. She would do best with canine companions to help with her confidence.\nPlease submit an application on our website. mattysheartandsoulanimalrescue.rescuegroups.org",

Can go all night (12+ hours) without peeing. So he can\nhold his bladder. He can be left alone for hours without getting into anything, when he is alone\nhe mostly naps till you get back. He won\u2019t get into trash or snacks lying around. He likes women\nmore than men. He's very energetic and loves to run around. He\u2019s a very quiet dog. He is a\nprotector of his family. His favorite treats are bully sticks and bones, he\u2019s a big chewer. He is\nvery trainable, and knows the commands sit, stay, down, leave it, wait, come, and high five. He\nwas trained as a service dog for anxiety and learned his service dog duties very well. He was\ntrained to help with my anxiety attacks and to snuggle me when I\u2019m crying. He does very well\nwith a firm leader as long as the person isn\u2019t \u201chis\u201d person. He\u2019s great with other dogs his size or\nbigger. Bigger dogs make him feel safe. He\u2019s usually responsive to commands, listens well.\nVery important that he not have one person to get attached to at his new home, he should be\npart of a group of dogs with a group of people. He will be happier and less stressed this way.\n\nCons:\nHe Growls when he gets scared or threatened, hardly ever barks. He is Not great with small\ndogs. \nLoki will appreciate an all adult home or if with kids 16 and older.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see all that well and doesn\u2019t always recognize \u201cfriends.\u201d He has a\nhigh prey drive so if cats or small dogs or small animals run he will chase them.",

Jack is Sherman's father.\nThey loved their dogs but worried that they would no longer be able to care for them.  We got two males and a pregnant female from them.  All the dogs are very well behaved and seem to get along with other dogs and everyone.  They are very gentle dogs.   Jack is Sherman's father, is very friendly and a very well fed, farm dog.  They had outside housing in the barn but all have been inside the house and behave well indoors.  The family preferred the dogs to house outside because they liked to run and play together.  Would love to see Jack in a loving home again.",

            "description": "Jobie is one of those dogs that you just want to sit down and have a comforting heart to heart talk with and comfort him from his fears in life. He is a 3-4 year old, Shepherd mix boy who was found a few years ago just roaming free and scared of everyone. Somehow a man who saw him for months hanging around his business, caught him and took him home to foster and find a home. Soon it was apparent that Jobie needed a trained foster who could bring him to another level of confidence and ease with people. Jobie has come so far and he is not over all his fears but he can live more comfortably in this world, and we are so proud of him. He is housebroken, crate trained and playful when he trusts you and warms to your presence. He is still a work in progress but if he had a home where the people leashed him daily and took him for walks and did one on one things very consistently, then Jobie would move forward even more. He will bark when he is loose in the fenced yard...just a quirk. He will need experienced and patient owners who have worked with shy dogs before. Time, love and some confident work with him will produce more progressive results each day. We are looking for a quiet household with no young children, maybe teens but still a calm and quiet household. Another confident easy going dog would be a great companion and example for Jobie to have in his life. A big brother or sister who can show him that there is nothing to fear in life. He needs a calm household of people and a calm dog to be his mentor and big brother or sister, if you have these things to offer please contact us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com",

            "description": "*ADOPT ME!*\nWylie - 10 years old, located in Illinois\nDog ID#: 201451-P-D-MO\nPlanned Intake Date: 10/17/2020\nAvailable Date: 10/31/2020 \n\nWylie joined the rescue with his daughter, Harper.  They lived as outdoor dogs until their owner fell ill and could no longer care for them.  They are loving indoor life and quickly adjusting to being housedogs.  They are excellent in their crates!  They are perfectly happy and quiet while foster Dad works from home.  \nDon\u2019t be fooled by Wylie\u2019s age or stature!  This big boned 10.5 year old handsome pointer can move!  He enjoys a good hike and has the stamina to go at least 4 miles without issues!  \n\nHouse life is fun for Wylie.  There is all this \u201cstuff\u201d around.  His first few days, he ran around picking up everything he could find\u2026blankets, kitchen towels, shoes, the remote, pillows, cat toys, even the throw rugs!  He was never destructive\u2026just a collector of things!  He is busy in the house but will happily settle down for a chew or a peanut butter kong.  \n\nWylie loves people.  He is very sweet and gentle.  He gets very excited to see other dogs on our walks and has been very friendly with the few he has met.  Wylie is also very good with our cats.  Initially he was excited to see the cats but he is very respectful and kind with them\n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption? Fill out our adoption application (http://www.pointerrescue.org/adopt.html)!!\n\nTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES! (currently within 600 miles)",

            "description": "Frosty is a 15-year-old Chihuahua dog. This boy was taken by his owners to a shelter to be put to sleep. We called to ask if we could see this little guy, When we first picked him up, we feared that he would indeed need to be put to sleep. He hurt whenever he was touched, tried to bite and could not go to the bathroom. He had a lump by his penis about the size of a golf ball.\n\nOur vet said he had a strong heart and clear lungs, but desperately needed surgery. It was found he had an impeded testicle and it had turned cancerous. His teeth started falling out when he was examined. Dr. Spencer thought he could remove all the cancer tissues and the remainder of his teeth.\n\nFrosty yelped in pain every time he was handled before his surgery but is now doing great after healing. He enjoys going out for some fun in the sun; he returns to the door and barks when he wants in. He needs a quiet home full of love to live out the final chapter of his life.\n\nHe weights 6 lb, is leash- and crate-trained. He is fully vetted, neutered, microchipped or can be with a voucher.\n\nHe can be seen at our adoption event or by appointment to approved applicants or at our adoption events. For more information, please visit http://FurrEverPetsRescue.org or call (9 a.m.-8 p.m.)/text Ione Fried, (903) 918-3213.\n",

That whole being a mother gig is so over rated.  they are now going off to their forever homes and I will be going to see the Vet Dr next week and be spayed whatever that is.  Ms Rhonda says it means I will never be having babies again.  Thank goodness that is a lot of work.  So I am ready to find my perfect forever love.

I am about 4 years old.  my last family brought me to a really scary place  called a shelter. Lucky for me the people there knew that isn't the place for a lady like me and called Ms Rhonda.  I had this thing called Heart worms but thankfully Ms Rhonda took me to the Vet Dr. and they got me all fixed up.  I have had all my shots, and even got fixed so there will be no more babies.  I have the best house manners, I love my foster brother he is a big black Dane like me.  I love to explore and play in the yard and I love to cuddle on the sofa.  I will follow you all through the house you will never have to spend another day alone.  So if you think you can be my forever match please go to www.brindleemountainanimalrescue.com and from the menu click on \"Our Animals\" you will find an online application.",

He is great with both male and female dogs, cats, walks well on a leash, very laid back, handsome as can be!\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\n\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Unfortunately in her past she was never potty trained, but she is pretty good about using a pee pad. She needs a home with no other dogs or cats, and respectful children. Someone who is retired and needs a best friend would be great! She is fixed, utd on everything, and recently had a dental done. Despite her age, she still has a ton of love to give and still gets the \u201czoomies\u201d quite often. Her absolute favorite thing is belly rubs and just being around her human.",

            "description": "Rosco is the sweetest senior you will ever meet. He loves to be with you and will tail to you no matter where you are. He would love a family to spend most of his time with, whether snacking on treats together, getting his head rubbed or lounging around the house. At 12 years old Rosco still has a lot of pep in his step. Even though his back legs are a bit weaker than when he was younger, Rosco stills gets burst of energy to run. Rosco is heartworm\n\npositive and has already started the process of treatment.\n\nWhile not a home, Rosco loves car rides and going for short walks. But once home he\n\nis a literal definition of couch potato and can nap for hours.\n\nTreats are his favorite and will\n\ndo all of his commands especially\n\nif a tast\ny treat is involved.\n\nHe enjoys playing with other dogs and would be best with cat free home\n\n. He is stubborn sometimes and requires a little extra work but he is truly worth it. All Rosco needs is a life filled with happiness and love with his furever people. Anyone would be lucky to have Rosco join their family. Send in your adoption application\n\ntoday at www.underhoundrailroad.org\n\nRosco is currently being fostered in North Carolina. He can transport North to his adoptive home, but unfortunately can not be adopted in the state of Maine due to him being heartworm positive. Please message us with any questions regarding transport or Rosco.",

            "description": "~~~~~\n\nLauren is a 1 year old rat terrier mix. Was left on the side of the road. A nice Samaritan  posted her on the local Lost pups page and no one ever contacted her- She called us as she couldn't keep her and we went ahead and had all of her vetting done. She is all up to date and ready to go home! \n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, December 5th, 2020 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

            "description": "~~~~~\nMomma Leela is the mother to the PEANUTS GANG Puppies ! \n She was picked up off of the street in rural Louisiana...  running house to house frantically hoping for a meal.....HEAVILY pregnant to boot. \n She was so so scared when she came in to the fosters home- She is so patient and tender with the foster family's children (  toddler and infant)  She is gentle, loving and sweet. Three days after arrival, she graced us with 7 more puppies to spay and neuter.  She has proven herself a tender , dedicated and attentive momma! \n She is a Manchester terrier, cattle dog and basset mix. We do not know what the father is.  She weighs a whopping 25 pounds.  She had a HORRIBLE case of Mastitis... as the pups were weaning.  Several days of strong antibiotics and she was back in shape to be spayed! \nNow that she is spayed, Microchipped, vaccinated and de wormed she is ready for a soft spot on the sofa!  She is current on Flea tick meds and Heart worm prevention as well \n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, December 5th, 2020 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

He does have some barrier issues with other dogs, and does best when meeting without a fence in between.\n\nShiloh is an amazing dog who is ready to be your best friend, he just needs someone who will never give up on him.

He is about one\nyear old, and has shown aggression to other dogs - but this may be \nbecause of finding himself in a frenetic, rescue environment without\nthe exercise he needs and the affection he craves.\n\nHe needs a home with a large secure yard and cannot live in an apartment. \nHis adopter needs to be active and confident, to guide him. He is a very sweet, but somewhat stubborn dog and will be a faithful, grateful and affectionate companion.\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.\n\nOur application is on our front page of Petfinder, on the middle, right-hand side under our logo. Please send adoption applications to either pintler_petsmt@yahoo.com or pintlerpetsrose@gmail.com\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/mt/anaconda/pintlerpets-mt33/",

He is 80 pounds of love!!! Freddie is extremely sweet and\nloves\nattention. One of his favorite things are belly rubs and well (second favorite thing) is butt scratches. He is completely housebroken, walks well on a leash, and it's about six years old. Freddie is neutered and up-to-date on his vaccines. He would do well as an only pet or with a dog that is non-reactive. Also he totally ignores Cats. Freddie knows basic commands but needs a little work with his manners, however, he is highly food motivated. If you are interested or have questions about this big ball of love, please contact Ashley at 954-931-1974.",

The former owners threatened to shoot this adorable dog if we did not come get him ASAP. Needless to say, we dropped everything to go save him. We can't understand why someone wouldn't want him. He is young, active, and loves dog friends. He is looking for an active home that can provide him the structure he needs to truly flourish. He gets along well with active dogs and like to wrestle. He also can live with kids as long as they aren't too young as he may knock them over. As always, we require a fenced in yard for all our adoptions. This is especially true for him as he can climb small fences.",

All visits and Adoptions are by Appointment Only.   Appointments will be made in the order the inquiries are made and meet the needs of the pet.   Thank you.\n\nSly is a 1 year old Yellow Lab mix. He is a handsome dog with Lab personality and size.   Sly is all about the adventure ahead.  He enjoys playing with toys, running around with them in his mouth is by far his favorite. Sly sits automatically for a treat or before you throw the ball.  He is very quick to learn. \n Knows sit for a treat very well. He is a smart boy. \n  We have had Sly play with young 4 month old pups and a female Lab mix and he was great - running from, chasing, wrastlin', and having a good old time taking whatever they dished out. Sly is okay with some dogs but reactive to those that intimidate him.  Sly would do well as an only dog with an active family or with another dog of similar play style.  He is large and strong but seems to like the chasing games over the rough and tumble.  A Meet and Greet introduction at the shelter is a must to be sure this handsome fellow will fit with your current pup.",

            "description": "Toby was part of an accidental litter (his Mom is Husky and Dad is Chesapeake Bay Retriever mix). He ended up being homed way too early away from his Mom where he lived most of his first months on a porch without much interaction of the family, any other dogs or met any new people. At only 5 months old he was surrendered to the shelter. He was too fearful there and went straight to a foster home where he is blossoming being around his calm and yet assertive foster Mom. Toby just needs some reassurance that the world is not such a scary place.\n\n\nVideo of Toby with his friend Olive:\nhttps://youtu.be/-UTQWvt4QK4\nToby's rescue journey video:\nhttps://youtu.be/arCu_Hy-FGw\n\nIt takes Toby a little extra time to warm up to new people. He is learning that new environments are really not that scary after all.\n\nToby is 9 months old and a big boy, currently weighs about 60 lbs. Once fully grown he should be around 75 lbs.\n\nHe is microchipped, neutered, up to date on all vaccines and on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nToby sleeps well on his dog bed at night next to his humans. He can be crated for short period of times. He loves going for car rides and outings. \n\nThis sweet fella enjoys playing with his toys and chewing on his chew toys like antlers and nylabones. \n\nToby would do best in a home without very young children due to being a big puppy and could knock them over. He is not cat-tested.\nToby has gotten along with the other dogs in the past at his foster home ranging from a small Chihuahua to a Border Collie mix. Toby can play a bit rough at times and can be domineering but just needs some correction.\n\nThis boy will benefit being with someone who is familiar with the Husky breed and who can exercise him by walking and hiking with him, and taking him running. He walks well on the leash and can get a bit excited when he sees another dog but can be easily redirected with a treat.\n\nToby is such a fun and happy fella who loves to cuddle and snuggle with his humans.\n\nIf you think you can provide Toby the loving home he deserves and you have the patience and time to work with him send us an email and request an application: NeedfulSoulsDogRescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Currently in foster in Puyallup, Washington. Lobo was a drop-off out in the country. Heaven only knows why. He is a Lab mix (about 60#s) and very friendly and a bit rambunctious. Judging an energy level from 1-10 (1 is the old Hound Dog; 10 is the Jack Russell that is like the Energy Bunny)... he is about a 7-8. I believe with exercise and training, he will settle down... most of the time. He has not had any training but he's very happy. We think he is about 4 yrs old. He was very skinny but is doing fabulous. He is a higher energy dog and you would think he was 1 not about four! lol\n\n \n\nChildren: Lobo is great with children but because of his high energy level, I wouldn't have him around young children. They need to be at least 12 or older. He will be a good partner for hiking, swimming, bicycling ...(you, not him), etc.\n\n \n\nCats: He does chase cats. Must be in a cat-less house or at least keep them totally separate.\n\nHeartworm Tested: He is HEART WORM NEG.\n\n \n\nHouse Training: We believe he has been an outside dog most of his life. Along with the behavior training, potty training should be easy because he's never known he could do his business in the house. It's just a matter of bonding and communicating.\n\n \n\nAdoptions include neuter/spay, vaccinations (DHPP, Bordetella, Rabies), microchip, transport with one of our professional dog transporters, and 6 mos of heartworm prevention..\n\n \n\nIf you have any questions, text me... 210-394-6060.\n\n \n\nLobo is available for pre-adoption. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out the on-line application. COPY and PASTE the application link .\n\nhttp://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-pet-central-satx/\n\n \n\nYou can also go to our Facebook page...\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Pet-Central-SATX-866684826744181/\n\nand LIKE us to help us out.\n\n \n\nGET IN LINE FIRST: If you are interested in this dog, please fill out the application (link listed above). The rescue will contact you once the application is received. Although we strive to answer everyone, due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we cannot guarantee a response to all emails. Filling out the application is the ONLY way to ensure a response from the rescue. In addition, while you are emailing us, if others apply, you lose out adopting the dog you chose. We have hundreds of puppies/dogs available so there really is no need to apply anywhere else. Also, one application is good even if you are interested in several different dogs...one application no matter which one you choose. We try to make it as easy as possible for you but if you are applying or have applied anywhere else, we do need to know that, too.\n\n \n\nSHANYE'S FOSTERS is a group of foster parents in the Olympia/Tumwater area. We foster dogs for rescues and assist them in adopting/rehoming of their pups/dogs by listing on this site. Many dogs posted here are available to pre adopt NOW directly from the rescue. The only ones in foster in the NW specifically state that. We have very few fosters so most need to be pre adopted. All adoption fees go towards rescuing more dogs in need. No one receives a salary. Shayne's Fosters is not responsible for any experience you have with any dog you might see posted on this site. They are the property of the sponsoring rescue who will supply all medical supporting records which is given with each dog when adopted.\n\n \n\nOur adoption fees cover all medical costs to make sure the pups are appropriately vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and spayed/ neutered. It also covers the cost of transport from Texas and the necessary health certificate documentation. The fees also include a negative heartworm test for any dogs over 6 months. Some dogs have additional medical, such as FHO, ACL, hernias, dental, and a myriad of other vetting. We do full disclosure of medical care/situations. If the adoption fees seem high (which never cover the true cost of rescue), we recommend fostering for a good rescue. Fostering ensures you incur no vet bills and no boarding fees. We are always in need of good fosters. We are all volunteers who donate our time and resources to help save as many dogs/pups lives as we possibly can.\n\n \n\nThank you for choosing to adopt a rescue pup/dog. Over 1 billion dogs worldwide are put to sleep (PTS) annually... thousands daily. The dog pounds PTS entire litters, pregnant/nursing moms and wonderful dogs that can make someone a great companion. We firmly believe there is NO breed other than \"rescue\" for all species. Thank you for being part of the village it takes to save these precious lives.",

We are not sure about the home life but it looks like she had Luigi and brother Dakota since birth because we also took their father Tank. There was also a female but a family member was able to add her to his family of dogs. None were ever neutered so Luigi and Dakota would fight over the female when she was in heat. All three had never been out of the home and all were very frightened. Luigi has adapted the fastest and already has become a volunteer favorite. They say his is just a sweet big boy that is loving the attention the volunteers give and going on walks for the first time. 3 years old and 86 lbs, this big boy would love a family of his own. The family member did mention that Luigi was very gentle around their small children. More pictures will be coming up of this sweet gentle boy. Please contact AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com if you would like to meet him.",

            "description": "This sweet bonded, mother and son pair came into rescue this summer.  They were both in need of basic vetting, and Atka's eyes were a hot mess, he needed entropean surgery.  Now that vetting has been completed and Atka's eyes have healed, they are ready to find their forever home.  We will not separate them, so please, if you are not interested in adopting them as a pair, do not ask us to split them up.\n\nThese two are a gorgeous pair of smaller husky, in the 45lb range.  Anya is 2-3yo with brown eyes and a dark nose, Atka is 10-12mos with blue eyes and a light colored nose.  We believe they are a mix of Siberian Husky and Chow; based on build, coat type, tongue color.\n\nBoth dogs are now crate trained.  We use Vari Kennel Ultras, they do not challenge their crates, or crate doors, and they readily go in.  Anya will climb chain link, or wire, therefore a privacy fence would be ideal.  Or, monitored potty breaks with lots of leash walks.  On the two occasions that Anya did climb out of our fence, she ran around the house, and sat down on our front porch, while we caught up to her and let her back inside.  Yes, accidents happen, and dogs do get out...that is why ID tags and microchips are so important.  We are working on house manners.\n\nFor additional information or an adoption application please email us... kaleidoscopek9s@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Meet Wilkie!   Wilkie is an older, more distinguished senior gentleman. He gets along GREAT with all dogs and cats. He even made good friends with the foster's cat!  \n\nWilkie can be hard of hearing and his eyesight in one eye is limited. It doesn't seem to bother him one bit though, as he has become used to hand signals for things such as \u201ctime to go outside\u201d.  He can get startled if he doesn't see you coming due to his limited vision and deafness, therefore a home with older children or adults only would be best. \n\nWilkie likes to go for short walks around the block and roam the yard for all the good smells. Wilkie takes treats so gently and loves to get spoiled with some extra biscuits.  \n\nThis salt and pepper senior is very resilient and is looking to live out his glory days with a family to call his own. He is on daily arthritis medicine that is very inexpensive and he takes it very well in a pill pocket.  \n\nWilkie\u2019s ideal home would have minimal stairs.  His current foster home has two steps to get in and out and he navigates them fine. Anything more than that though could be too much for him. Rugs or carpet in the house could be helpful for him as it helps him get traction when moving around. \n\nHe's a simple guy who just wants a blanket to sleep on, treats and some lovins every now and then.

Jasper is a big oof that is a leaner and wants to be with you all the time and loves the outdoors. Jasper and Jasmine love each other and play well together They are in a foster home with teenage girls they love and a beagle. \n\nI do not advise young children as they are fast and unpredictable and they scare Jasmine. She takes a while to warm up and will do so with treats She will need to be given time to adjust and stay with Jasper.\n\nABSOLUTELY no crates whatsoever as they both will become very anxious and harm themselves. They have to remain together.\n\nThe perfect home is one with no cats, no small children and one that is home most of the time to help them through their adjustment.\n\nWe prefer the Dallas area so their trainer can continue to work with them if needed.\n\nIf you are that family, please contact us.",

Thank you!***\n\nMeet the fun loving Petula!! Petula is an 10 month old female Terrier mix.  We cannot express to you how cute she is in person!  Petula weighs in at 45 pounds now, she was rail thin when she arrived but now has filled out nicely.  Petula is a light brown brindle color with a white chest and some white toes.  And the most adorable FLOPPY ears you have ever seen.  Petula was found as a stray and was starving, she has been the sweetest girl from day one and has already put on some pounds.  Petula is a very social, outgoing and friendly little pup. She has no fear of anything or anyone. Great with kids, too!  Just a lovable sweetheart. A family that can give her a lot of attention and that is home more would be ideal for Petula. As you will see by her video she has a lot of puppy energy and loves to play. So we would love to find an active family for her that will have the time to play with her and just have fun.  If you have another dog you will need to bring your dog in to meet her.  And we tested her with cats and she did great.  Petula has wormed her way into all our hearts here and we cannot wait to find a loving and forever home for her.",

Her owner was not prepared to handle a young, strong, and energetic dog. Maggie also did not get along with her owner's daughter's female dog, which is not uncommon. Maggie is a nice girl who is playful, loving, and a lot of fun. Maggie has been fully vetted and her fee is $125.\n\nMaggie is a somewhat petite gal, weighing only around 50 pounds.\n\nMaggie has had some basic training. She is not yet two years old, so she does still have some puppy playfulness. She is a lovely gal who adores her people but she does need to be the only pet in the home. Exercise is the key to dog happiness and Maggie needs someone who is willing and able to give her what what she needs. Kids over 10 would be best.\n\nNOTE: We are closed to the public but are doing adoptions via private appointment once an application has been completed and approved. Applications can be submitted at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

I also love to cuddle.I may be 3 years old, but I'm a puppy at heart! I'd do best in a home with no dogs, no cats and no children under 13 years old. I'd love to be your one and only.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am a little shy with new people, but I warm up quickly. I am treat motivated. I'm still learning basic cues and manners, but I'm doing very well. I walk well on leash.SometimesI can be a little reactive on leash, but I've been working on that and I'm improving.I'm also housebroken. I don't necessarily love my crate, but I will go in with a yummy treat or chew toy.\n\nDoes London like other pets?\n\n I'd do best in a home as an only dog. Also, no cats, please.\n\nDoes London like children?\n\nA home without children or older children, 13 years and older would bebest.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I lovestuffed animals, especially if they crinkle or squeak. I also lovemedium to tough chew toys/treats, especiallybully sticks!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I would do best in a home with a veryactive family. I'd love a home with a huge backyard where I can run and play. I would need a family willing to work with me and bond through training. I'd love to be an only dog and a home without cats would be best.",

This 3 year old pup weighing in at 18 pounds will make someone the perfect best friend as he loves to play, is confident, but also appreciates quiet time with his person.  He has good house manners and gets along great with other dogs.\nRuby (right) is 3 years old, a spaniel/doxie mix, and weighs 16 pounds.  Ruby is a shy girl, but loves attention and cuddles.  Ruby likes nothing better than being someone\u2019s lap dog.\nIf interested in meeting these 2 pups please submit the online application found on our website www.argosdogrescue.org under Adopt.",

We believe this 2 year old girl is a mix of Lab/Spaniel and Hound and she is true to the hound nature vocally. She has a lot to say and will make sure she is heard. She will alert you to any squirrels or people around. Ruth has not always been treated the best so she can be hand shy and very sensitive. She also has some separation anxiety. She cries/barks when you leave so she is not a candidate for apartment life. She is kennel trained and does go in her kennel when nobody is home. Ruth is a potential runner so a fenced in yard or long walks will be best for her. Ruth is still learning good leash manners and will need more work with that. She would do best with a Gentle Leader or walking harness. She has lots of energy and would love an active dog friend to be with! Ruth is looking for a home to help her build her confidence and work with her on training. She is super sweet, learning to cuddle and an overall gentle dog. She is not suited for a home with young kids or cats. Ruth is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Her adoption fee is $275.00",

            "description": "Macho is masked up and ready to meet his forever family!  He is a 1 yr old lover boy, who loves his people and wants to find a forever family where he can be their spoiled child. \n\nMacho was born to Mercy (yellow lab) last year and was adopted by a family who spent a ton of time and energy training him.  Unfortunately, as he got older, he and the resident senior boxer did not see eye to eye and it wasn\u2019t fair to the original dog. \n\nHe is a total sweetheart, but has some fear based quirks that need clear direction and guidance, without the use of force.  He has been working with our behaviorist, and the new foster/adopter will get continued support and sessions with her. He needs a person/family that will be patient with him and give him time to settle in. \n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home. For more information, visit our website www.canerossorescue.org\nor email us at rescue@canerosso.com.",

She ended up at the shelter because her owner passed away and we could not let this sweet girl perish so we saved her. Frankie arrived in Vermont weighing 90 lbs. and is much healthier now having lost over 40 lbs with a healthy diet and balanced active lifestyle! Her ideal home would be one in which her humans are home often and there are no other dogs; she is a diva and prefers all of the attention (even though she lives with her furry foster sister dog)! Frankie loves to go for car rides and be outdoors with her family; with her current foster, she has enjoyed paddle boarding, camping, and walks! She is potty-trained and great with children. Frankie would enjoy a more rural, quiet setting with a yard. She gets scared of loud noises and traffic, but loves to lounge in the sun and roll in the grass! Frankie is incredibly easy to care for, so grateful for her 2nd chance, and ready to find her forever home!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Frankie please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site) thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed.

My previous owner had to surrender me to the HSMC because he was moving. I am weary of new people, but will show you my sweet side once I trust you. I love to play in water and go for walks. I need a seasoned dog owner that is familiar with large dogs. I am okay with female dogs; but I need to be in a cat and child free home. If you'd like me to be your best friend, please come in and visit me. Ask a Kennel Staff Member to arrange a meet and greet for us. Thanks!\n\nPatiently waiting,\nPongo",

            "description": "This is Miss Percy who was dumped in the shelter we think because she was sick and had had many puppies born and taken. She was sad and withdrawn at the shelter. But once she left that place and felt safe, everything changed! The following is from a fellow rescuer who went to visit: I walked in and said, Hi princess! and her whole body started wiggling. She acted like she has known me for years! All she wanted to do was sit with me and give LOTS of kisses. Her eyes were bright and she had the most beautiful calm energy. We sat together for a while and then she was ready to go inside. She let me know by going to the door, standing at it and looking back at me. I let her in and she went straight to her kennel, grabbed a quick snack out of her food bowl, and then curled up on her blanket This lady is so delightful, happy, and clearly has embraced the indoor only dog lifestyle. Its just amazing to me how grateful these dogs are for a warm bed. She doesnt know it yet, but Percy has a brand new life ahead of her. Shes destined to be someones forever princess \nThis girl is only 7 years old and has plenty of life and love to give! Please consider giving her a chance!",

            "description": "Twiggy, (58 lbs. and growing. 12/24/20) is about 1 yr. old, named for her long slender model like legs. She might also be named because of her fascination with twiggs and bushes; whos to say? Little is known of the life she led prior to joining our care but its certain Twiggy missed classes about crossing streets and dumpster diving. Luckily, she is a master at giving kisses and loving on her people. Twiggy enjoys affection, hugs, kisses, snuggles, and being very close to her people. She hasnt mastered the concept of personal space so expect lots of snuggles in bed.\n\nTwiggy can understandably be a little shy meeting new people but she is friendly to people she has come to know and trust. Shes great with other dogs but is definitely curious about those small fluffy things her humans call rabbits and squirrels.\n\nTwiggy is learning to enjoy car rides especially because this means frequent trips to Belmar Nature Park where she has already made several dog and human friends. She needs a slight boost to get her butt in the car, she is able to jump down. On nature walks she loves watching the wild life, sniffing, enjoying the park, and of course living up to her name and finding twiggy branches. She likes to remove the small twiggy branches and gallop around, happy as a clam!\n\nTwiggy originally ended up in an overcrowded shelter due to an injury. Thankfully, 2BABR saw past that and rescued her from the euthanize list anyway! Twiggy had FHO surgery in mid-December and is recovering very well. She is able to easily climb 32 stairs about 4-5 times a day, walks 2-3 miles over several walks. She likes to walk at a moderate to a fast pace. She is working on small hills to strengthen her right leg. She is able to walk with a slip lead sometimes at a comfortable loose lead but is often excited to go see friends or go back to her new foster home. She is cooperative with the word wait, release when we cross the street. She has not been asked to sit on command due to her recovery but is learning stand to leash up. \n\nIt will be important for Twiggy to continue strengthening her right hip. Twiggy does go on city walks around Lakewood with her foster sister, Lucy, and a few other friends in the pack. While busses and cars seem ok, garbage trucks and loud metallic dumpster noises concern her. \n\nTwiggy will need a secure yard with a 6ft fence. Despite her injury if she gets spooked she can easily climb fences under 6ft. Shell also need continued training as she likely has had no formal training in her past. She has been attending weekly group classes and is doing very well! She is learning to transfer these skills to the busy outside world. She is respectful of older dogs and gets along very well with her bossy foster sister Lucy who reprimands her for being rambunctious in the house. She loves to chew on her toys stuffed animals and definitely has an energetic, puppy play-style.\n\nTwiggy still has the puppy wonderment and the joy for life as any young dog should. She is playful but is an awkward 1 year-old dog. It is unknown how she would interact with young children as she is a bit gangly and uncoordinated, she could possibly knock them down. It is unknown how she would do with cats as she has not been exposed at my home. \n\nTwiggy is looking for her forever home who will love her long legs and appreciate her wonderful demeanor! She has a zest for life and know shell spoil any person/family with so much love and joy!\n\n \n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Birdie is a little shy to new people, but get down to her level and she quickly loses that shyness. She's pure sweetie with a little sprinkling of spastic lab to top if off. This sweet lab does what all labs do, goes from 0-60 in 2 seconds flat. Birdie performs wonderfully with dogs of all sizes and isn't afraid to let the big dogs know that she's here to stay. We highly recommend she go into a home with another dog to help build her confidence with her humans.\n\n \n\nBirdie is 98% potty trained (just 1 accident) and sleeps through the night in her kennel. She is kennel trained and will go to it if asked. While she hasn't been around children, we do recommend older children as younger children may frighten her. She loves playing with toys, chasing or being chased by other dogs, and enjoying a good cuddle at your feet. She'll love anything involving activity. If Birdie is the lab you're looking for please send in an application to meet her today.\n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Posted 11/14/2020\n\nAlice and Flo came to us because their human had to go to a nursing home.  It was her wish they remain together and from observations from their Foster Mom, they are truly inseparable.  \n\nAlice and Flo are approximately 1 year old Terrier mixes.  THEY ARE NOT HYPOALLERGENIC AND DO SHED. THEY HAVE NEVER LIVED WITH CHILDREN.  Alice and Flo are very energetic when they play in the yard, but in the house they just want to snuggle.  They truly crave attention and want nothing more than to be loved on and sit in your lap!  The girls are working on leash manners (they apparently were never walked on a leash) and basic commands (it's a good thing any approved applicant will take them to class).  They are house trained and crate trained.  Alice and Flo have been spayed, microchipped, fully vaccinated, tested and treated for intestinal parasites, tested negative for heartworm and lyme disease and started on monthly heartworm/flea preventatives.  If you want to add a little (because these girls only weigh about 8 lbs each) joy into your life, consider adopting Alice and Flo!  THEY REQUIRE A FENCED YARD AND SUPERVISION WHILE IN THE YARD.  \n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption fee required. If you would like to apply for adoption, please complete the online application at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under ADOPT tab. Please also read our Core Values prior to applying. Contact generalinfo@furryfriendsnetwork.com for questions or if issues are encountered with the adoption application or general adoption process.\n\nFoster Homes are desperately needed in order to help more animals like this one. Please consider opening your heart and home to a homeless animal. To find out more about becoming a Foster Parent, see our website at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under VOLUNTEER tab.\n\nPet ID:",

He is friendly to every person he meets and is a gentle giant weighing in at 70lbs.  But don't let his size intimidate you because Bender couldn't be more affectionate. Bender does great in the house and would prefer to be in a home with his family vs outdoors (unless his family is outside with him). Bender is kennel trained and he won't potty in his kennel.  He is house trained and does amazing with not having accidents inside as long as you take him out regularly. Bender likes other dogs but would do better in a home without other dogs,  or with another confident well trained dog that does not feel the need to be dominant.  Bender does good with female dogs and is okay with cats (especially kittens).  He does not like the dog park or dog day care type setting and would prefer to just be with his people . Bender is very passionate about the person he chooses as \"his person\" and would love to be by their side and follow them around 24/7. Even off leash outside Bender didn't try to run away from his prior foster family in TX. Anytime you give him the okay, Bender loves to snuggle up on the couch with you and spend quality time together. \n\nBender came to us all the way from TX where there are more dogs in need.  His owner dropped him off at the shelter & he was put on a list to be euthanized which we could not let happen.  He has been with his foster home in TX that has shown him all of the ropes for a month now before making his journey up here to MN. \n \n----------------\nBold Animal Advocates is a holistic animal rescue who utilizes natural alternatives to traditional dog preventatives, medications, and vaccination when available & also feeds an optimal raw food diet. While not required to continue, preference will go to those willing to continue care holistically.\n\nWe value training and our dogs being well behaved members of our community so continued training for all of our dogs for the remainder of their lives is required.\n\nWe have recommendations on our website for companies that we love and trust if you would like suggestions.\nboldanimaladvocates.com\n\n***Please apply here***\nhttps://forms.gle/g5EKPNw8steM2roo7\n\nWe will review applications for and reach out to those who we think may be a perfect fit to discuss next steps. Please note that during this time we may be unable to respond to email & phone inquiries so the best way to reach us will be by applying. We are required to charge sales tax on this adoption fee of 7.125% and accept cash, check, or Paypal at the time of adoption. Thank you!",

She is 2 months out of surgery to fix her hip dysplasia. In spite of pain she has endured prior to rescue, she is the most loving, happy dog. She dances when she is eating & constantly wags her tail. Atari gets along with most dogs but prefers calmer ones. She absolutely loves all people including children and is very gentle with everyone.  We have learned she would love a dog buddy in the home with not many stairs, along with a fenced yard.  We need new foster, as we are trying to figure out why she is gagging too often...has had $1,000 worth of tests to show nothing.  May have anxiety as she has had 2 long-term fosters & we are not sure what has happened for her.   \n**\nThank you for your interest in applying to adopt ! Events slowly being scheduled due to pandemic.....watch LOVE Mutts Rescue Facebook for all calendar events, & info.

He loves kids, other dogs and doesn't mind cats.\n\nAfter having his leg amputated, Beanie has adjusted and doesn't seem to notice he's a leg short. He runs and jumps and plays just like any other dog.\n&\n\nWe are not a shelter, we are a rescue and all of our rescued pets live with a Tennessee foster family until their forever home is found. They are all checked by a veterinarian, current on their vaccinations, spayed/neutered are micro-chipped. Our fosters know the animals best and will give you an honest assessment of their traits and training. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a pet from Saving The Animals Together, please submit an application by clicking on the Adopt tab at www.savingtheanimalstogether.org or email us at statadoptions@savingtheanimalstogether.org \n\n\nAs soon as we receive your application back, we will check your references and then contact you for a telephone interview. At that point the foster will contact you to discuss the pet with you.",

            "description": "ADOPT ME ONLINE: https://ophrescue.org/dogs/9014\n\n Hello. My name is Fionnuala (Fa Nu La)....... \n I am a special little girl who came from a not so special place...\n I am thought to be 2 or 3 years old and weigh about 15 lbs. \n Thanks to my foster mom and OPH for being such wonderfull people I am here and able to tell you a little about myself....\n I can be shy and nervous around new people and it can take me awhile to get comfortable with them but with the help of my wonderful foster mom she is showing me that all people are not like where I came from. \n I don't mean to be rude. I am just scared and nervous. So don't be upset if the first time I meet you, I bark and back away this is still some of many things my foster mom is helping me to overcome..\n I had a rough start in life and need people to have a little extra patience with me.\nDue to this I think I would do best in a calm house with kids over 12 who can understand what i have been through and give me some space to get use to my surroundings...\n I like most dogs, especially if they are close to my size. However, I tend to be a little possessive of my food and treats so it is best if you feed me in a separate area away from other dogs.\n I love to run around and play in my foster's fenced back yard and I can run really fast. Deer and squirrels and other animals really get my attention. Sometimes I think they would be fun to play with and other times I want to protect my yard from them...\nSo due to that, my foster mom thinks its best that I have a fenced in yard where I cant get out of in case that feeling comes to me to want to chase them...\nI have to be in a secure harness and/or martingale collar with a leash because if I get loose, I will run and can be hard to catch....\nI'm gonna need a patient adopter and one who is willing to help me with my training and help me trust again....\nI am a very sweet girl and once I get to know you well I am a great snuggler. I am a special girl waiting for my special forever home... \n I am crate trained and house broken is that a perk or what \nI am looking for a home to finally call my own.I will miss my foster mom but I will always remember without her I wouldn't be here to find my forever home..\nSo if that all sounds good to you apply for me and help me become the loving dog I know I can be with just a little patience and time.\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

Not just someone looking to add a dog to their home,\u00a0 but someone looking to help a super-sweet, scared dog with separation anxiety feel safe. \n\nSomeone looking to make a difference for an animal in need. \n\nNo small dogs. Would do phenomenally well with a larger confident companion  dog. She loves to play with larger dogs or dogs her size. \n\nHas an initial fear of men, something happened in her last home. She wants to trust men and if approached gently will flip over and give her belly for rubs. She is now doing great with my adult sons. It just took gentle introductions.  Nella needs a gentle compassionate experienced family to ease her out of her shell. She's amazing. No cats,  they are too fun to chase. Fenced-in yard mandatory. \n\nSomeone enbracing the quarantine life would be ideal. \n\nTraining included with Jack Atmeh of Behavior Plus (our \"go-to\" trainer for our rescue)\n\nAnd if you're looking for insta-pet keep looking. \n\nCollie/Husky mix. \n\nEmail SusanRescue@aol.com to discuss Nella's needs and if you could be a fit.

They were having a good time running around in the kennel together with no problems.  \n\nMonday  I took him to the vet  and he climbed in the back seat of the car by the window and sat there very still looking out the window all the way to the vet's office  .He is beautiful and very lovable  but not good with cats I hear.

He will need an active home with someone to keep an eye on him. He would love to have a nice big yard to play in. He loves to go on hikes and long walks, and afterwards, get affection and play, play, play!\n\nAce can entertain himself for long periods of time with his toys and balls. He'd love to have you throw his ball, but if youre busy, he's perfectly capable of throwing it for himself!! If you're around and won't throw it for him, he'll throw it where he can't get to it and expect YOU to be the retriever!! He's very clever!\n\nAce needs to learn some manners but he is a bright boy and will learn quickly. He is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and ready to go to his forever home today!!!\n\nAce is a staff favorite and we will hate to see him go, but he needs to get out of the shelter and into a family of his own. To find out more about Ace, meet him and see if this crazy pup is a good fit for you, text or call Julie Tuesday through Saturday between 9:00 and 5:00 at 435-773-5209.",

Her favorite things are being outside with her people, playing with her toys, and sprawling out on her back for a good belly rub! She is a super sweet & happy girl who LOVES her people, but does not do well with other animals so an only dog home with an active & experienced foster/adopter would be ideal for her. She is currently working with a trainer who has offered to continue training sessions with a foster/adopter willing to give Abby the chance she needs to live her best life! (copy & paste the links below into your browser to check out the recent videos of Abby with her trainer at the local PetSmart). She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated and microchipped. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/wuJqTgJz8RU\nhttps://youtu.be/06LSBuZfKA0\nhttps://youtu.be/mBM7zNrHAUE\n\nFor more info about Abby, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

            "description": "Hi! My name is Alaska! I was surrendered by my owner to Big Dog Ranch Rescue, along with my sister Reeci, after our owner passed away. We are bonded and it would be best for both of us if we could be adopted together. I am a good boy but very vocal and sometimes you might mistake those sounds as me being angry, but I promise I'm not. I like to play with other dogs, but I can be selective with who I choose to engage with. As a Husky, I most likely have a high prey drive and would probably prefer not to be in a home with cats or other small animals. I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE if I could find an experienced Husky owner who is aware of our high energy levels, large size, and high-maintenance grooming needs (I need to be brushed daily!). I would love a great big yard for me to run around in and I think I'd be happiest living a rather quiet lifestyle with my new family. I can be a bit protective of my territory so it's best to go slow with me and let me warm up to you. I am most protective of my food and will become quiet vocal during mealtimes which may sound mean, but again, I am really a true sweetheart! I do require additional training, again I am VERY vocal, but I do appear to be potty trained and love to go for long leashed walks.",

I give the best, biggest hugs!\n\nI love humans so much but I do need to be the only animal in my future forever home and need to be in an adult-only home. I get worked up when I see other dogs on leash (and I\u2019m a strong boy!) so a home with a big backyard is a must (no apartments for me, please!) And I just need a human who can set me up for success by walking me in quieter areas and is willing to invest time and energy in helping me with my leash manners. I\u2019ve been learning SO much in my foster home and I\u2019ve made amazing progress on leash! And I\u2019m excited to continue to learn in a forever home.I\u2019m crate trained but also responsible when given free rein of the house. I\u2019m just looking for a forever home where I can relax and be with my people!\n\nAre you ready for a big, goofy, playful companion who will love you always??

            "description": "Please read through thoroughly and carefully before applying for Gina. She is a great dog but needs a special home. Gina is a gentle soul with a sweet disposition. Her ideal day would consist of sunning herself in a beautiful backyard during the morning and cuddling with her human on the couch in the evenings while she catches up on Grey's Anatomy. She does not always get along with other dogs. She has nice leash manners, and house manners and is always up for anything whether it be a stroll around the block or napping at your feet. Gina came to us with an ectopic ureter which caused her to leak urine; because of this she had constant infections and chronic pain. Since coming to us she has had surgery to correct the problem but sadly it was not successful. Gina will likely need to wear a diaper while in the house. She tolerates them well. Someone who works from home or is retired will likely be the best fit. This sweet girl would love a home of her own where she can relax and continue to enjoy life! She is crate trained and bounds in anytime she's asked. She has shown to be on the quiet side in her foster home and doesn't do much barking. She is incredibly responsive and comes quickly whenever her named is called, in fact, she's rarely far enough away from her foster mom's side where she needs to be called. She knows a couple basic commands such as sitting when asked and waiting for her food bowl to be put down on the ground or to come through the door. She seems to ride well in the car and jumps in for every adventure. She also sits nicely for her ears to be brushed and groomed. She really is wonderful and would make a fantastic devoted companion to anyone looking for a delightful and cheery shadow.\n\nGina is not recommended for homes with children. She has offered to bite two in a previous home. She is reactive to fast and loud movements.",

Crunch was transferred in from a county shelter so we do not have any information about his previous household. During his stay at our shelter he has been on a couple weeklong slumber parties. The clients from the slumber parties have reported that he has done well in their homes with dogs, cats, and children. One slumber party client reported that he had no potty accidents in the house, was gentle with their kids, and was fond of cuddling and belly rubs. We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. We always recommend caution when introducing to resident cats because behavior can be different in a home environment. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Crunch.

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\nApplicants MUST BE a minimum of 25 yrs old to ADOPT.\n\n\nMy name is Roden, I was rescued from a shelter in south Texas when I was a 2 month old puppy then adopted by a young lady who had me for a year and returned me to my foster mom because she no longer had the time for me. I then moved to NY where I was adopted to a family with a 1 year old dog but unfortunately we did not see eye to eye all the time. You see I need time to decompress and understand where I am and my new sister did not understand this so I would get mad at her when I was done playing but she wasn't. I'm a young dog who likes to play but I like to settle down as well, I need a dog who understands dog language and can respect my boundaries when I'm ready to sleep or be lazy. For this I think I would be best with a family with another quieter/calmer dog. With people I am a super sweet loving boy who wants all the kisses & cuddles! I may be a little timid for the initial meeting but after a bit I will show you my easy going demeanor. I also love running around outside to play! I am a young guy at only 1.5 years old so I still like to jump and hop around & younger children may not be the best fit without some coaching. I'm very good at listening and it doesn't take much to correct me or recall me. I am really good in the car & love to go with you on adventures. \"\nI am wanting a home with a fenced in yard and a canine buddy already in the home for me to play with. \n\n\nName: Rodan\n\nAge: 6/9/2019 \n\nCurrent Weight: 50#\n\nRescued from: Texas, found as a stray originally.\n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccines\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n\nRodan was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. He will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on 11/18/2020 ready for adoption!\n\nTo apply to adopt Rodan, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

She and 6 others were discovered living near an old tree stump down south.  They had clearly been dumped there and were trying to survive. Wendy was heavily pregnant and all 7 had clearly never been socialized around people. Wendy had no interest in having help from humans with her puppy delivery. She was very wary of people...as time went on, her puppies grew older and were adopted at the beginning of August. Wendy then went to a loving foster family who could spend time with her and get her to come out of her shell...\nhere is what her foster has to say:\nWhat a journey!! Wendy has been with us for 4 months and has come such a long way! She\u2019s still working on her fear of boys but is a perfect lady! She just wants to be loved and to make friends.  Her favorite things are rubbing herself on the lawn and drinking rain puddle water.  Loves long walks in the park and a quiet place to observe her surroundings (loves her crate for this).  She\u2019s easy to love but will need a very patient human to help guide her to trust and a fur buddy (also loves cats). Wendy is between 3-4 years old. \nIf you are interested in giving Wendy a loving and patient home, apply on our website!!! *no children under high school age...and another dog/cat in the home would be great!",

I was found emaciated, but in my foster home I have gained weight and foster mom says I'm very healthy now. I love lots of exercise, tough chew toys, snuggles, and treats. Boy, do I love treats! I was a little wary of humans at first but since being in my foster home, I've learned to trust them and be more confident in myself. I snuggle my foster parents while they watch movies and foster mom says I give the very best hugs and kisses! She also says I may need some training once I\u2019m with my forever family to work more on my confidence and house manners, but I am very, very smart and learn really quickly! So far in my foster home I\u2019ve learned how to \u2018sit\u2019 and wait patiently when there\u2019s something I really want, like those treats I mentioned earlier! I am also house broken and crate trained. I occasionally nip to get attention or try to play with my foster parents, so foster mom recommends I be in a home with older teens or adults and no small children. Since I have lots of energy, I\u2019d be really happy to have a fenced in yard and/or someone who will run or hike with me! Older dogs haven\u2019t liked how energetic I am, so if my forever family has other dogs, foster mom recommends they be close to my age and energy level! I will fit right in with a patient and active family. I have a lot of love to give & can't wait to meet my forever family!    \n",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nMeet Isabelle (Izzy to her friends) a beautiful & fun loving Blue Heeler mix. Izzy is MOSTLY DEAF & will need to be adopted to a home that will put the time into properly training a deaf dog. Izzy is a typical blue heeler, she loves to herd & play. She is great with other dogs & we would prefer she went to a home with another dog to play with & learn from. Izzy is great in her kennel, quickly picking up leash walking skills & LOVES to learn. Older children would be best as Izzy is a young excitable gal. \n \nIzzy is up to date on all vaccinations and she is spayed.\n\nTo apply to adopt this dog, visit www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and submit an application. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

I'm extremely loyal and desire to be with my people all the time. I'd really love a home where I will not be left alone often. As is common for my breed, I am very intelligent and enjoy working my mind just as much as I enjoy playing or going on walks. I am a large guy and very strong, and I do need some work on my leash manners. I'd appreciate a home with German Shepherd experience, but it is not a requirement. I really value my one-on-one time with humans and would probably do best as the only pet in your home. Please call the Mason City Stray Animal Shelter at 641-424-3617 for more information.\n\nAdoption fee covers the following veterinarian\u00a0services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriate\u00a0vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, heartworm test for dogs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnimals listed with the Mason City Stray Animal Shelter will be held for 7 days from the \u201cEntry Date\u201d to give the opportunity for an owner to reclaim them.\u00a0 If not reclaimed, the animal will be made available for adoption to the public.",

            "description": "-Ruby was returned on 11-14-2020 after living in a wonderful home for 4 months. She enjoyed regular trips to the lake and various parks. Unfortunately, Ruby has very long legs and she quickly learned to jump/scale tall fences. \n-Ruby came to us as a young puppy and has lived most of her young life in a kennel and is ready for someone to take her to a calm, loving home. Her eyes express her heart which is big as a mountain but she has trouble expressing herself. She hides sometimes from new people or jumps too much on others she's happy to see. She responds well to lavender essential oil. She sits on command and is getting better walking on a leash. Once calmed, she is nothing but love!\n\n*To adopt Ruby, please fill out your application at this link: HTTPS://PETSFURPEOPLE.ORG/PRE-APPLICATION/",

            "description": "Lou is looking for someone very special to give him a chance, whether it be a foster home, or a forever home--he is hopeful to have a place to call his own.\n\nWe won't put it lightly...Lou is a very scared boy who needs someone with experience with nervous/fearful/under socialized dogs. He will follow his human/foster around everywhere, but still has hesitations with petting and touch from people. He is extremely friendly with other dogs, and should be placed in a home with at least one other dog as he has always been surrounded by the comfort of other friends and really enjoys some company. He needs a fenced in yard where he can potty and play, and a home that will be able to dedicate the time to getting him more socialized with humans and how to be a confident dog.\n\nWe would like to see Lou go to the forever home that he deserves, and we will be waiving his adoption fee. DO NOT APPLY if you do not have experience with nervous or fearful dogs!!!! We need someone serious to step up for Lou so he can have a successful life as a house dog.\nClick below to get started:\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/TGD/Dog\nor\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/TGD/Dog\n",

            "description": "Ethan is a low-key senior that is just looking for a loving family to call his own. He appears to be a Shepherd/Chow mix, with the characteristic black tongue. With his coat and coloring, we think he looks a bit like a tiny lion! He has a very pretty coat, but will shed in some seasons. He doesn't exactly love being brushed, but will tolerate it within limits.\n\nEthan spends most of his time napping on his foster's bedroom floor, never wanting (and even disliking) being on the furniture. He is generally very low energy, spending majority of his time sleeping and finding a toy to toss around occasionally. Tennis balls are his favorite. He has some mobility issued though so he doesn't play too much. Ethan can also be a bit grumpy at times, and should be handled accordingly. He fusses and whines over too much cuddling, but loves getting head scratches. Those are his favorite and he comes up to beg for more! He will allow his foster to pick him up, but not fail to complain. Ethan will be best suited with a somewhat experienced dog owners and with no young kids in the family.\n\nHe likes going for walks, though we limit them given his arthritis. He also has a tear in one leg, though the vet didn't feel a surgery at his age would be advisable. He gets around just fine, just slowly. He may benefit from some pain meds if needed, but we have not been doing that since he is a master at pill detection, no matter how good you are at hiding them. He has done fine without them. He is housetrained and very good about coming up to you when he needs to go out. He may ask to be let out once in the middle of the night, depending on the schedule. Guess all seniors can have similar issues :) He lives with 4 other dogs and does well with them. But he may not like high-energy dogs being too rambunctious around him.\n\nEthan is neutered, up to date on his shots and was treated for heartworms, but now clear. He does have some eye issues and currently gets eye drops. His next follow up is in 3 months, but it is possible he may need meds permanently. He has decent vision (it improved as the meds started working), but he can't hear very well. Not a problem really since he doesn't generally get into anything.\n\nIf you are looking for a chill companion dog, Ethan may be a great addition! 2/2/21 3:35 PM",

            "description": "Hazel is a 9 mos old 20 lb Greyhound mix. In foster in olympia, WA  No apartments/condos she can be noisy. MAYBE perhaps a specific condo if noise doesn't travel \n \nDo you know Hei Hei, the rooster, from Moana?  Then you will be familiar with the personality of our beautiful Hazel!  Hazel is a 9 month old mostly Italian Greyhound.  \n \n \nMaking sense of her surroundings is probably never going to be fast or easy for Hazel.  Once she does, she will surprise you with her determination to accomplish some goal she has fixated on such as chewing Christmas tree lights, playing with the cat (which she does by sitting on her hind legs and windmilling her front paws around in the direction of the unimpressed cats), pulling the bed out of the Bully girl\u2019s crate and sleeping on it even if it is upside down.  \n \nShe will run super fast with the Italian Greyhound hops every 2 or 3 feet and she can jump very high!  When something is in her path outside or inside she will whine until you show her how to get around it or remove the obstacle.  When she gets tired or confused which happens often she will put her nose against a wall usually in a corner and be silent.  If you don\u2019t know her usual spots you almost need a GPS tracker to find her in your house. Hazel is not now and maybe never will be entirely house trained.  \n \nShe hasn\u2019t been able to walk on a leash yet but now that she is staying awake longer we are working on that.  If she is agitated by too much commotion she will try to climb onto the head of the nearest human.  Hazel is unable to be left alone at this point in her life but that may change as she gets older and grows comfortable in a forever home.  \n \nFor all of these reasons the ideal home for Hazel will be one in which someone is able to be with her at all times, there is another smallish dog for her to follow outside and snuggle with inside, probably no children or at least not very young children, no rentals due to her loud voice and lack of house training, and the understanding that this is a very special needs dog so you decide not so much to get a pet but to take on a new fur kid but she is welll honestly a project.  \n\nThe rescue had medical in Tx. Since being here in Olympia, WA we have had a complete exam with the vet, fecal, full blood panel, x rays and toxicology exam. NOTHING is wrong with her physically that we or the vets could find. (yes her vet bill is close to $1000 just since being in the NW), not counting all her other medical, transport, etc. \n   \n\nThis is a posting for L & S Dog Diggity Rescue. You can fill out and application below. Yes you must COPY and PASTE this application link. \n\nhttps://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-ls-dog-diggity/\n\nAll adopted pups and dogs are transported to WA/OR families when fully vetted, spayed/neutered and microchipped.For information on how to adopt me, please contact my foster parents at info@dogdiggityrescue.com. L&S Dog Diggity Rescue is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, where there are over 350,000 homeless pets. We save homeless and abandoned dogs and find them loving forever homes in other areas, where pet homelessness is not epidemic. All of our pets are located here, in San Antonio, and we partner with  rescues to provide transportation for our pets to their new homes. Our adoption fee includes vet care (vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchipping, etc), as well as transportation and health certificate. Please contact us to ask about our adoption process and our adoption fees. You can contact us directly at info@dogdiggityrescue.com, or fill out an application at  https://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-ls-dog-diggity/ \n\nImportant: If you are interested in this pup/dog, please fill out the application (link listed above). The rescue will contact you once the application is received. Although we strive to answer everyone, due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we cannot guarantee a response to all emails. Filling out the application is the ONLY way and ensures a response from the rescue. In addition, while you are emailing us, if others apply, you lose out adopting the dog you chose. We have hundreds and hundreds of puppies/dogs available so there really is no need to apply anywhere else. However, if you are applying or have applied anywhere else, we do need to know that.\n\nSHANYE'S FOSTERS is a group of foster parents in the Olympia/Tumwater area. We foster dogs for rescues and assist them in adopting/rehoming of their pups/dogs by listing on this site. Many dogs posted here are available to pre adopt NOW directly from the rescue. The only ones in foster in the NW specifically state that. We have very few fosters so most need to be pre adopted. All adoption fees go towards rescuing more dogs in need. No one receives a salary. Shayne's Fosters is not responsible for any experience you have with any dog you might see posted on this site. They are the property of the sponsoring rescue who will supply all medical supporting records which is given with each dog when adopted.\n\nOur adoption fees cover all medical costs to make sure the pups are appropriately vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and spayed/ neutered. It also covers the cost of transportation from Texas and the necessary health certificate documentation. The fees also include a negative heart-worm test for any dogs over 6 months. Some dogs/pups have additional medical, including but not limited to FHO, ACL, hernias, dental, and a myriad of other vetting. If the adoption fees seem high (which never cover the true cost of rescue), we recommend fostering for a good rescue. Fostering ensures you incur no vet bills and no boarding fees. We are always in need of good fosters. We are all volunteers who donate our time and resources to help save as many dogs/pups as we possibly can.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt a rescue pup/dog. Worldwide over 1/2 or 1 billion puppies/dogs are PTS yearly. thousands and thousand daily (yes entire litters, pregnant/nursing moms are PTS daily just in U.S. shelters. Yes even entire litters of puppies yes DAILY in many US shelters! We firmly believe there is NO breed other than rescue for all species. Thank you for being part of the village it takes to save these precious lives.",

            "description": "Meet Maya! This bi-lingual beauty is as smart as she is gorgeous. Maya was very loved by her previous family, but they had to leave the country and were not able to bring her. Upon her arrival at the shelter in November, Maya was pretty shy. Over a couple months, her personality blossomed and she bonded closely with kennel staff. Unfortunately, day after day she continued to be passed over for adoption. In hopes to learn more about her personality and match quicker with her future family, Maya went into foster care where she is quickly making herself at home! Maya is an expressive lady with a silly demeanor once she gets to know her people. When getting home after a long day, she will prance around and stare at the door to go outside or on a walk. Although happy to do her own thing, when she does want to show her lovey dovey side, she will nuzzle in the crook of your neck and has uncanny accuracy when it comes to licking you right on the mouth (kinda gross, but have to appreciate the sentiment!). Maya is quite chunky at this moment (almost 100lbs) and is working on improving the COVID bod. She loves walks and enjoys forcefully bossing around the other household pup. At around 6yrs old, Maya is pretty settled down, despite Husky breed stereotypes, and would be ideal for a laid-back bestie looking for a cat in a dog's body. Maya is simply looking for someone as special as she is. Think that may be you?",

            "description": "Xander is a healthy, male American Staffordshire Terrier who is 2 years old. He is fully house and crate trained, likes people, and does well with several commands, like sit, lay down, wait, come, quiet, paw and look at me.  Xander loves to be outside during the day whenever possible, and his evenings are mostly spent cuddling on the couch until bedtime. \nAlthough he is 76 pounds, he considers himself a lap dog. He is very food motivated and will come running if he hears you say \u2018banana\u2019, his favorite treat. He loves to go \u2018bye-bye\u2019 in the car and will make it to the door before you do when he thinks it\u2019s time to go somewhere. \nAlthough he has lived with a confident older female dog without issue, he can be dog selective so he will do best as an \u201conly child\u201d which he loves because he enjoys being center of attention;) He has not been around small children, but has never shown any aggression toward guests, family members, or service providers (pool guy, plumber, pest control, vet) \nHe is very tolerant of things like nail clipping, baths, and kisses on the face from mom. He is still working on perfecting his leash training skills! \nXander is a very smart and handsome boy who is good natured, affectionate and a true people dog. \nHe is looking for a family who has experience with his breed and can provide the structure and leadership he will thrive off of.??\n**adopter must have secure, wooden fenced yard- no iron, no chain link, no apartments**\n\n***Dallas area/metroplex adoptions only.***\nThe first step in our adoption process is to fill out an adoption application http://elmanimalrescue.org/adoption-application/.  This is how you meet our dogs and does not obligate you or ELMAR to adopt the dog; we are looking for the best match.\nWe reserve the right to deny adoption to any applicant.\nAll dogs and puppies are adopted with up to date vaccinations, spay/ neuter, microchip, dewormed, and thoroughly examined by our veterinarians. \nPuppies under 6 months - $250\nDogs over 6 months - $225",

If you are looking for a calm, mild mannered senior dog, this is the dog for you. She gets along with other dogs and cats just fine. She recently had a few teeth pulled but don't let that fool you, she is just fine with dry dog food. She has an adorable tongue now that sticks out to the side of her mouth from the teeth extractions. It definitely adds to her cuteness! She is heartworm negative, as well as her kidneys and liver in good condition. She is house trained, walks great on the leash and no bad manners like chewing stuff up. She loves to lounge in her dog bed, but most of all she just loves to follow me around. Please consider adopting Mazzie, she would be a great fit as the only animal in the house, or as an additional family member with other animals.",

He tends to be more naturally trusting of women, but can warm up to men once he knows them and their good intentions.\nA smart fellow who is quick to learn, Nolan is happy to chill and relax with you in the house, and then head out with you on a brisk walk. Nolan has good leash manners and does well when meeting other dogs while out on his walks. He appreciates a good roll on the grass and would love a fenced-in yard.\nNolan is a gentleman inside, and is both house- and crate-trained. He enjoys his stuffed toys to chew on and wrestle with. He can quickly identify his own toys and leave your belongings alone. Did we mention that hes very smart?\nSo thats the package! If you are looking for a loyal, loving, intelligent companion, why not ask to meet Nolan? He is looking for the same!\n Nolan came into a local shelter as a stray.\n Read more about Nolan on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-178/.",

Check out Sadie's video and you will likely fall in love like we have!\nSadie is crate- and house-trained; and she knows several commands including Sit, Lie down, Stay, Go crate, and Away. She loves belly rubs and will ask for them by flopping over onto her back. She will also put her paw up to ask for pets. But she understands if it's not time for pets and will give you space. Sadie enjoys playing fetch and brings the ball back (when she wants to) \nShe needs an owner who will stick to a training routine and who has a fenced-in yard. During walks, she gets very excited when she sees animals and sometimes people. Sadie's main exercise is in the backyard and she should only get walked early in the morning or late at night. Sadie is currently receiving professional training to work on her 'stranger danger' and leash reactivity, and her foster parents are seeing improvement every week. \nSadie is looking forward to a dedicated and loving furever home!\n Sadie Grove was found in a field.\n Read more about Sadie Grove on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-200/.",
