But not by us, we had been searching for foster families for these dogs for a couple of months. Each time we struck out we\u2019d feel defeated that they\u2019d have to spend another day in a cage. We knew how amazing each of these dogs were and we wanted others to have the opportunity to see it too. Our interaction team took another group of fosters to meet the trio and we were so hopeful that this was the miracle we were wishing for. Guess what? Dreams do come true!\nJake's foster dad says Jake is the life of the party and needs to be included in everything! He says he is smart, eager to please, and responds to positive reinforcement with treats and petting.\nEDUCATION:\n* Sit\n* Stay\n* Down\n* Come\n* House trained\n* Crate trained\n* Working on the rest of his manners\n* Responds well to redirection when needed\nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS:\n* Treats: not picky with treats, enjoys deli meat on special occasions\n* Food: Honest Kitchen Turkey flavor, Stella & Chewy Chicken\n* Toys: balls, tug ropes, smart toys with peanut butter\n* Cuddling, especially on your lap\n* Loves to be outside\n* Loves attention\n* Likes to dig and zoom before he poops!\nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: friendly\n* Kids: overexcited, recommend older kids\n* People: overexcited\n* Cats: unknown\nCHALLENGES:\n* Not a big fan of getting his paws cleaned\n* Is mouthy, especially when playing. Working on that!\n* Has been known to run off with shoes, slippers, towels and bras but he doesn't chew them\n* Pulls hard but eases up on the leash",

Weight: 58 Lbs\nAdoption Fee: $ 250 (NOW FULLY SPONSORED as a two people have sponsored her fee) includes a 2 week trial to ensure everyone's happiness!\nLucitta or Lucy as we call her is a real beauty! The people that we got her from said she was Australian Shepherd healer Pitbull mix, but I'm her foster mom and I don't see the Pitbull in her. It doesn't matter anyway because they are the most loving dogs around. She loves people!!! It takes her awhile to chill with other dogs and she prefers them to be more medium size..... Not her size. We do meet and greets with new families that have dogs to be sure there is a good match between them. We want everyone to be happy and that is why we also give you a 2 week trial to be sure she fits in well with your family. She would also be perfectly happy being the only dog in the family.\nLucy is housebroken and crate trained. She is really well behaved in the house and listens well. She does know the commands of 'sit', 'down', 'off' and learning to shake. Doing ok on the leash walking. I think if she had more practice she would be perfect at it. Lucy is extremely smart and so loving. Give this beautiful girl a chance to be a part of your family. A home with a fenced yard is preferred.\nChildren ages 10 and older please.\nI have been spayed, vaccinated, heartworm tested negative and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting me, please complete the adoption application located at www.furrykidsrefuge.org/adoptadog and a dedicated volunteer will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nFurry Kids' Refuge is in need of good quality dog and puppy food with meat as the first ingredient. You can drop off donations at our weekly adoption events at the Lee's Summit Petco (1860 NW Chipman Road, Lee's Summit, MO), Saturdays only from Noon to 4:00 p.m. Donations are tax deductible as allowed by law.\nWould you like to foster a Furry Kid? Furry Kids' Refuge will supply the food & vet care while you supply the basic house rules & love.......win-win for all!! Just visit our website http://www.furrykidsrefuge.org/category/fostering/ for more information. Thanks for your support!",

Both are old wounds and he has been medically cleared of either having any future issues with his health. He is also 100% deaf, he understand hand signals. Because of his deafness I am requiring a fenced in yard to keep him safe. He loves playing with the other dogs and plays excellent by himself, loves all the people he has met, he keeps his kennel clean (with dog door) doesn't eat his bed. He is microchipped, neutered and vaccines are up to date. He is a wonderful companion dog who loves to snuggle. \n\nApplications are accepted now, they are NOT first come first serve..  \n\nALL adoptions are done FACE TO FACE, we DO NOT ship dogs out. Adopters must travel to Fairbanks if you live outside the area. Potential adopter must have an overnight visit with the puppy/dog and everyone who lives in the home including pets need to be at that visit. (folks out of town need to travel with all in the home, including pets NO EXCEPTION \nPlease DO NOT email the rescue asking if this or any dog is available, all our dogs are available for adoption unless their ad states pending next to their name. Inquiries just asking if a dog/puppy is available will just be deleted! If you cannot spend 2 mins reading an ad you have NO business getting a puppy/dog! These ARE NOT Christmas gifts, and inquiries asking if they are will be deleted.\n\nAll adoption fees are $400\n\nDue to Covid the rescue is not allowing anyone in to the kennel buildings, rescue office or the puppy barn. No one can visit more then one puppy. All visits will be done outside so dress for the weather. Children must stay in the vehicle. If you want to meet a puppy before placing a deposit on one you can wait until covid is no longer an issue. \n\nPlease review our adoption process before filling out an application. Adopters MUST be at least 21 to adopt, do not contact asking to bend the rules. \nTo see more photos and videos of the rescues visit the our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/ArcticGermanShepherdRescue\nPlease note that Petfinder's application is not AGSR application and cannot be a substitute as one. To contact the rescue directly email agsrescue@gmail.com with any questions that are not found on the website or in the ad\n",

Adopted as a cute, little puppy he has now grown into a handsome, black dog. As he grew up he spent more and more time alone in a backyard. Chile gets so excited with people that he can't contain himself. After the initial introduction he will settle down on a leash and give you a sit. He longs for human companionship. Despite his poor start in life, he is full of unconditional love. Chile's best friend and playmate at the shelter is Shadow. Chile likes to chase balls and toys. Chile, when matched with another dog of his energy plays well. He and Shadow are like two peas in pod at playtime. Chile is a Weimaraner terrier mix. Would you like a big chili to keep you warm this winter? He's ready and waiting to spend furever in your home. Please call for an appointment today.",

Max has been let down terribly by humans, and he has been constantly adopted out and dumped back at Miami Dade Animal Services.\n\nMax has had no stability and he has been returned just weeks after being in a home. Max has had no structure, and he has minor aggression issues that are being worked on in professional training. He used to not like when you put a slip lead leash over his head, but he has now gotten over this issue. He now sits on command and allows you to put the slip lead leash over his head without reacting. He now goes into his crate willingly and he does come out on command. Max does not like his collar to be pulled/tugged and he will warn you by growling. The trainers are currently working on this issue. These issues are  likely due to abuse in his previous homes. Because of this Max CANNOT go to a home with children of any age.\n\nHe is being worked with in training daily to overcome his behavioral issues.

The shelter was a horribly scary place for her and Gretchen became rescue only, not available to the public. Over time, Gretchen warmed up to her handlers and started to come out of her shell. We rescued Gretchen from the shelter on August 25. Gretchen will need an experienced, patient adopter who will give her lots of time to decompress in a new home. For this reason we would prefer a calm home with no children, so that Gretchen will get the time she needs. Positive reinforcement training is also a plus. Gretchen is protective and barky with new people/strangers and will need an experienced handler. Gretchen is fixed, chipped and vaccinated. We think she is a year old. If you are interested in meeting her please fill out an application http://ozziespoundpuppies.org/online-application/\n",

            "description": "This sweet boy is Comanche.  He is a 6 month old Hound mix who weighs 45 lbs but will about 65 lbs full grown.   \n\nComanche loves to play, is very sweet, loves other dogs and seems to like cats.  He is a pretty shy dog when he is out in new places but he is very loving and kind.  He is going to do best with a dog companion\n\nComanche would like a home where he has an active family to take him on daily walks and play with him.  He would benefit greatly from having another playful dog in the home and will definitely need a fenced yard with a 6ft fence and plenty of room to run and play.  \n\nComanche is  crate trained.  He is working on leash, and house training but will need continued assistance in his forever home.  He is doing really well with house training and even alerts you by scratching at the door but will have an accident if you do not hear him.\n\nComanche does have some allergies. He is on an over-the-counter antihistamine right now that is low cost.  He is also getting medicated baths at the moment.  This may be something that causes more frequent vet visits so please take into account the added cost.  He is worth is though!\n\nComanche is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Comanche and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Thankfully, she befriended a dog out on a walk with his humans and they took her in until she can find her forever home!  Gigi takes a day or two to warm up to new people, but once she does, she will quickly become your best friend!  She\u2019s treat motivated and doing great with training to help with separation issues as now that she knows how nice people can be, she wants to be with them all the time!  She\u2019s housebroken and crate trained, but can be vocal when left alone, so no apartments.  She goes to doggie day care and stays at a kennel when her people are out of town and has been a staff favorite! Gigi loves snuggling with her people, chasing squirrels in the backyard, going on hikes/adventures with her foster family and playing with her 4-legged foster brother (an RRR alum!).  Gigi will do best with someone home all or most of the day who will continue with positive training and has no young children.  Gigi would like to have a dog sibling to play with but it is not a requirement as she bonds with her people and would be fine as an only dog.  With some additional time for her to adjust and continued training, this sweet girl will make someone a great new best friend!",

            "description": "\"Remi is an adorable, loving and goofy almost 2-year old, 50 pound black pit bull/lab mix who is missing her left front leg. We call her a \u201ctripod.\u201d She came to MADACC as a stray when she was young with a broken leg and the vet decided to amputate to give her the best quality of life. Nothing slows Remi down and she thinks she is a perfectly normal dog.\n\nThings Remi loves: Remi loves to play fetch, run around in a yard, play with other dogs her same \u201cspeed,\u201d and play with her toys. She loves car rides and boat rides, alike. Water is her favorite! Although, she does need a life vest \u2013 Tripods missing their front legs need some extra help. When she is tired, she is the ultimate snuggle buddy and loves to sleep with her humans. There is nothing more that Remi wants than to be near her family and snuggle on the couch or bed.\n\nThings Remi does well: Remi is completely potty trained. She waits patiently for her breakfast and dinner and runs straight to her kennel when it\u2019s time for you to leave for work or errands once the sound machine goes on and treats are in hand. When it comes to play, Remi is very smart and brings tug toys to you to play with or chooses a bone out of the toy basket to entertain herself if you\u2019re busy. She also is great at bringing other resident dogs toys to play tug with. Food is her #1 motivator, next to affection, and will do almost anything for treats while working on her manners \u2013 she\u2019s a smart cookie and is always ready to learn new things. Remi is also very good at sharing.\n\nThings Remi needs to work on: Her leash manners are the utmost priority. Remi can either pull when on leash and can easily get wound up on walks and chooses to lay down instead. So, a Weiss Walkie leash or Ruff Wear harness is a must (which she will come with for her new family). Remi does much better throwing a ball around in a yard with her humans or playing with a larger, active dog friend instead of walking for exercise, since finding a suitable walking cadence for a \u201ctripod\u201d can be challenging. Jumping up is another manner Remi is working on and her new family will have to continue to reinforce \u201call 3 on the floor\u201d prior to giving attention. Remi feels safest in her kennel when she has to be left alone, otherwise she can get anxious. She may have been abandoned at a young age and does not like when her people leave, which is why her \u201csafe space\u201d (aka her kennel) is a necessary part of her routine. If you are home, she will want to be near you \u2013 a human that works from home or is around more frequently is preferred. In addition, she can be a watchdog and will notify you when she hears something unusual that startles her. While not a \u201cbarker\u201d by any means, Remi may bark to get another dogs attention to play but this is infrequent.\n\nWhat Remi is looking for: A yard is a MUST and fenced-in is highly preferred. Remi will not do well in a condo/apartment environment and is looking for a quieter home environment but one that has room outdoors to explore. An experienced dog parent and children over the age of 10 are necessary due to her typical puppy playfulness, jumpiness and strength of her tail when she\u2019s excited (talk about an adorable wiggle-butt). Remi is looking for a family that will provide her with consistent routine, exercise and continuous training to keep her smart, active mind stimulated, otherwise she can become anxious (this is fully manageable though). She would do best with another playful dog sibling who is active yet secure and respectful \u2013 a dog she can look to for confidence. Otherwise, a dog sibling isn\u2019t entirely necessary but is preferred. Remi has shown some dog selectivity on leash with smaller dogs so a dog her size or larger is recommended. She has met only a few cats before and did ok but was highly curious. A home without cats is preferred.\n\nTo make her transition as smooth as possible for both Remi and her new family, she will come with all her familiar supplies and guidance to help set everyone up for success. Remi is an incredibly loving, happy-go-lucky dog who only deserves the best home possible. Does this sound like a match? Apply to adopt Remi and meet her in-person! *Local Milwaukee residents or those within reasonable driving distance will be considered due to a necessary staggered transition plan that will include a meet-and-greet with all family members and then a sleepover prior to making any final decisions. Thank you!",

Sure that someone must be looking for this adorable meatball a kind woman took him to be checked for a chip (no chip found), then she took him home. The finder did everything she could, she posted him all over, called the shelters, called the vet offices and when there was nothing else she could do, she waited. No one ever called and so the kind woman put out a plea for a rescue or adopter. We agreed to take him and get him out of TX as he needed a fantastic and responsivble home. Getting him out of horrible humidity and hot weather will also help him to feel better. This sweet lug arrives today and we would be THRILLED for him to arrive to his new family. \n\nIf interested in helping Cletus please contact us ASAP!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\nDue to his predominant breed being an Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog we are seeking an adopter with BRACHYCEPHALIC BREED EXPERIENCE. Further all our brachycephalic dogs MUST vet at an AAHA certified vet, this is because of their extreme vet needs. Brachycephalic dogs are extremely expensive dogs to upkeep so please bare that in mind when applying and make sure you're in a financial place to take it on.\n\n $400.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.) \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

He will be getting neutered on 01/11. He is very sweet, & craves human interaction, he is playful but not crazy. He is great with other dogs, he was curious of cats when he first got here but since he's had no exposure to them it is not recommended. He is good with older kids but a home with small children is not recommended. This boy is very smart and highly trainable. We are not sure what happened to Otto when he was younger but he is not a fan of the crate at all, as he appears to have some issues with being confined to a small space. We are working with a trainer on reconditioning and he is doing fabulous! We are up to 3 hrs with no issues.\nThis boy is the absolute sweetest and would do best in a home that has another dog (not a senior or small breed). \n If you would like to make this super sweet boy part of your family, please complete the online application to begin the process.\n\n**BREED MIX IS DNA CONFIRMED**\n33.2% American Pit Bull Terrier\n16.8% Siberian Husky\n14.6% Australian Shepherd\n11.3% Australian Cattle Dog\n9.1% Border Collie\n5.2% Brittany\n9.8% Supermutt \n\nWhat\u2019s in that Supermutt? There may be small amounts of DNA from these distant ancestors:\n\nChinese Shar-Pei\nChow Chow\n\nhttps://furrytailendingscaninerescue.org/adoption-application/\n\n**DUE TO BREED MIX A FENCED IN YARD IS AT LEAST 5 FT HIGH REQUIRED**\n\n**PLEASE NOTE EMAILS FROM THE SITE EXPRESSING YOUR INTEREST IN ADOPTING WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.

She prefers not to share her human with another human.   She will eventually show her human unlimited love and devotion.  Shy would be fine with another small dog that could teach her the ropes and she would be OK in a home with a cat(s).  \n\nShy is sweet and playful.  She is a 2-year-old female Rat Terrier-Chihuahua mix who weighs about 10 pounds.  Shy needs a fenced yard as a leash still scares her a bit (although she is learning to walk on a leash and working on other basic commands).  She is very good at doing her business outside when you take her out regularly.  Shy will need to be in a home without small children, and with someone that is mostly home, with the patience to allow her to continue to blossom at her own pace.  What a rewarding experience this will be!\n\nShy will be your shadow but prefers to make the first move.   She will join you on the couch and bed inviting you to pet her.  Eventually she will make herself at home on your lap.  \nAt night she likes to snuggle up close to you in bed and if you let her, she will get under the covers, and even give you kisses.\n\nShy has had her vaccines, is spayed, has had a dental, is microchipped and on flea/heartworm preventative.  To welcome Shy to your heart and home please submit your application at VIPrescue.org.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to know more about this dog, please complete an adoption application so that our volunteers  may contact you.    To do so, go to our web site:  http://viprescue.org/jobs/apply/?j=772\n\nAll of our available dogs for adoption are are on our website at:  \nhttp://viprescue.org/available-for-adoption/\n\nCheck us out on FACEBOOK and learn more about our adoptions and current events:   \n https://www.facebook.com/VIPRESCUEFLORIDA/\n\nTHANK YOU for thinking Rescue,\nVIP RESCUE OF FLORIDA\n\n",

He needs an understanding family who will take things slow and allow him time to adjust to new people. \n-\tCanine siblings \u2013 would do best with a more submissive female\n-\tSuper smart \u2013 Brickle is currently working with a trainer to help him be his very best. He would love a family who enjoys training and would continue this.\n\nTo meet Bricklebaum, please visit our website, www.pittieslovepeace.com, to submit an adoption application. Bricklebaum is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $250.00 and includes doggie kisses and a lifetime of LOVE.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing a predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

He will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY once he has a foster or adopter!\n\nGeorgie would do best in a calm household without a lot of stairs for him to navigate. He would also likely do best in a home without other dogs or young kids so that he can relax and adjust to his new surroundings on his own terms! If you're looking to open your home to a happy, chill, lovable dude in his golden years, Georgie is your guy! He loves to lay around, relax, and take in the outdoor air!\n\nTo apply to adopt Georgie, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

He had boils and sores all over his little body as well as hair loss. His family could only afford minimal medication but syringe fed him and got him better. We got him and took him to the vet for medication and treatment. Fast forward three months later and he is a happy, playful guy that would be the life of the party. \nHe will make you laugh! He is still a \"diamond in the rough\" but with time his hair will grow out and he will be BEAUTIFUL!! Let me know if you are interested in meeting him. He's 5 months old and would be the love of your life. Available through Bullywag  Inc.",

She had been stabbed, straigh through side to side, when the knife or sword was pulled out it brought her spleen with it. And then she was left to die. She was in need of emergency medical care. Her former rescue was able to get her all fixed up but she did loose her spleen. However it healed up nicely! No cats and probably no small dog's or kiddos bc she is a big goofy girl and may hurt them on accident! She is working on her doggy social skills! Evie needs to be the only pet in the home, and needs proper intros with new people friends. She has been in boarding for awhile now but has made huge progress while there and is ready to be in a home. Once she loves you, she loves you with her whole heart.",

She's been fine with the 4 and 7 year old grandkids at her foster home. Tori would be fine in a home with other dogs, but would also be happy soaking up all the love and attention as an only dog! New things can be a little scary for her so she does require patience, but she is just the sweetest thing. She's great with dogs and cats but can get alittle guardy of things she didn't used to get (beds, toys) but it's not bad and she corrects well!",

I am a 16 year old Shih Tzu - about 13.8 lbs. \n My adoption fee of $250 includes my up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, deworming, and I come home spayed/neutered. I even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for?\n\nI'm a beautiful black and white Shih Tzu mix seeking someone I can lean on. You may notice my tendency to move in an unusual pattern. The adoption team can actually tell you more about that. I say it's because I can't see so I'm just trying to get my bearings. Leaning against you can help stabilize myself while you pet my lavish fur coat. Please consider letting me circle my way into your heart.\n\n If you'd like to adopt me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org, and an adoption advocate will be with you shortly. Feel free to check out more of my friends or more information on PawmettoLifeline.org. I can't wait to meet you!",

I am loving and sweet with humans, kids and other dogs. I am working on some manners but I do pretty well in a house with a doggy door. I LOVE to go outside for walks (I love this so much that I sometimes to to get my human to hurry up) and love running in large yards. If I see a man or some one on a bike, I may try to protect you from them, but I am learning that not all those people are bad. I have lots of energy and other dogs sometimes think I can be a little bit of a pest to them. I love to play with ropes toys and I fetch or if no one else is playing with me I will throw a toy to myself and chase it around. I have completed fast-kill heart worm treatment. I am spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. My adoption fee is $200. To learn more about me or to apply to adopt, please visit www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables",

MEETS WILL NOT BE ARRANGED UNTIL ADOPTION APPLICATIONS APPROVED. IT CAN TAKE 10-14 DAYS FOR AN ADOPTION LEAD TO RESPOND TO YOUR APPLICATION. PLEASE BE PATIENT. Thank you!!!\n\t\nPlease visit our website @ https://www.niagaradogrescue.com/ or apply for adoption @ https://niagaradogrescue.com/adoption/.  \nif the dog is not listed on the NDR website, please put the dog's name down anyway, profile just may have not been uploaded yet\n\t\t\nName: Kimzie\nWeight: 53 lbs\nAge: 4 years (DoB 7/3/16)\nGender: female, spayed\nBreed: boxer mix\nColour: brown & white\n\nGood with adults: yes\nGood with kids: unknown\nGood with other dogs: can be dog reactive, will need behaviour training\nGood with cats: no, has a high prey drive\nHouse trained: yes, she will also ask to go out; but has had accidents in the house when left home alone. This is likely related to her anxiety, or an attempt to mark her territory, and not the need to physically go to the bathroom, so she will need someone who can work on this with her.\nCrate trained: yes, but does not like being in the crate when left alone and has chewed her way out of a metal crate in order to escape. At night she doesn\u2019t need to be crated, she has slept in dog bed at night peacefully.\nEnergy level: medium\nCan be handled/touched: yes Kimzie is a complete love bug.\nBarker: a bit\nFlight risk: unknown\nFood aggressive: no\nWalks on leash: yes\nRides well in car: yes\nDestructive: yes when left home alone as she has separation anxiety.\nNeeds a home with a yard: yes\nNeeds a home with another dog: no, she needs to be the only dog\nCan live in an apartment: no\n\nKimzie suffers from anxiety when she is left home alone. She will need a home where adopters are home all of the time, including work from home full time (even after pandemic restrictions are lifted) and can work with her to help ease transitions for periods when she must be left alone. She can suffer from anxiety with only being left alone for a couple of hours. A former foster did give her CBD oil and it seemed to provide assistance. An adopter who is willing to work with her on this, and exercise patience with her while she overcomes her fears of being alone is what she desperately need.",

My name is Hugo and I\u2019m a very handsome 8 year old boy looking for a new forever home. How did I get my name? Well when I was a puppy someone said \u201cOh! He\u2019s Huge!\u201d Take the letter O and put it at the end and you get HUGO.\nMy foster mom says I am stubborn and I want to do things my way. She says I need to go to a home with lots of Malamute experience, and one that will sternly but fairly make me follow the human pack rules. Since I am so large my new home needs to have older kids (12+) so I don\u2019t knock any younger children over when I play.\nI love going for walks and car rides and I even got to ride in 4 small airplanes to get from my last home in CO to my foster home here in Gladwin MI. It was quite the adventure and naturally all the pilots loved me. Whenever my foster mom takes me out for walks, I literally stop traffic! Everyone wants to stop and pet me. Who can resist all this handsomeness!\nToys are lots of fun and every so often I get a good case of the zoomies to let out the silly side of my personality. Oh, I\u2019m a cuddler too so I need to be able to lay right next to you on the couch or bed and I am pretty particular about what time I get up in the morning. It took a bit but my foster mom finally figured out what kind of food I like to eat.\nI need to be the only pet in the household as I do have a typical malamute prey drive and I\u2019m not good with ANY other dogs BIG or SMALL. In fact I am a country boy at heart and I would do best in a rural area. City life with dogs all around bring out the less than lovable side of me. I do know all the basic obedience commands, but sometimes I drive my foster mom nuts when I take forever to do the command or just plain ignore her unless there is a treat involved.\nI hope I find a new home soon. Is your family the one for me?\nPlease go to our website at www.fewstepsfromhome.com to fill out a meet and greet application or email us at dogrescue0146@gmail.com for more information",

            "description": "\"Hi, there, and thanks for stopping by. My name is Winnie the Pooch, which the internet tells me means I'm a good boy! I'm 2 years old, 63 pounds, originally from North Carolina, and looking for a moderately active family where everyone is 8 years old and older. I'd really love to meet everyone in the family at the center on my adoption day! I need to be your only pet, but I promise you won't even miss other dogs or cats.\n\nMy photos all make me out to be very serious, but that's just my RSF - Resting Serious Face. I can be a little more reserved when I first meet people. But after I've gotten to know you a bit, I enjoy a good cuddle and giving some kisses. I'm not going to clean your face - you have soap for that - but a few tender kisses every now and then never hurt anyone.\n\nI'm also very curious, and a sometimes silly guy who likes to experience new things. I love sniffing while out on my walks because there is just so much to smell. And if you show me something is OK, like playground slides, I'm 100% willing to give it a go. On a recent walk with some friends, we met our local mail person who let me jump into their truck for a quick sniff around. It was my first time in a mail truck, and it was amazing! 10 out of 10 would recommend! I'd love to go on car rides with you, too. I find the car very relaxing.\n\nI am a foodie, and proud of it. You've got food, I'll eat it! I sometimes try to steal treats from my friends, especially if it's cheese, but I will also work for it. I've tried some agility at PAC, and really like it. I also have friends who are teaching me \"touch\" and working on my leash walking skills. I really enjoy working for my treats, and would love to keep up my training with my forever family. But I also love playing, so don't make me work too hard, OK? Throw some tennis balls around for me or give me a rope toy to shake and I will be so happy.\n\n OK, some last minute facts about me. I am neutered, microchipped, and up to date on my vaccinations. Someone also loves me so much that they sponsored my adoption fee! And that means I can join your family today for free! I hope you'll come meet me soon. \n\nXO Winnie\"\n\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Boone in person, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog\n\n**Some of this pet's photos have been provided by Crissy Everhart Photography (https://www.crissyeverhart.com )& sponsored by Subaru.\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. \n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

I really love getting the zoomies! A few months ago I was living on the streets and I was pretty sick Some super nice people found me and did something called a mass removal on my back end and I feel so much better now! I really need humans that will help me stay healthy and I promise to give all the love and kisses possible! \n\nMac is about 7 years old but doesn't act a day over 3 years old! He is vetted, vaccinated, and ready for a home!!! He had a cancerous mass removed, so he will need to stay on a daily medication. He gives the best kisses and can't wait to meet you! \n\nEmail contact@hopeforpetsrescue.com with any questions!\n\nwww.hopeforpetsrescue.com/adoptionapplication",

My play style is pretty energetic, so I may not be for every dog. I went to training class with Teacher's Pet to learn some basic manners. They said the more I work my brain the calmer I get. So hopefully I find a family that takes me to class and keeps my mind busy in the home. I am so sweet and just want to play with my toys and get belly rubs. \n\nBrown Sugar is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped and spayed.\n\nBrown Sugar spends her days relaxing in a foster home. If you would like to meet with her, please give us a call to arrange a meet-n-greet. Thank you!Thank you for showing an interest in our pets. We can never guarantee the breeds of the animals. We do not DNA test. Please feel free to call us with any questions.",

            "description": "Mimosa\nJack Russell Terrier Mix\nGender: Female\nDOB: 04/10/2018\nAdoption Fee: $175\nMimosa was brought to our shelter by an amazing lady that saved her and two other dogs. When they came to us they were so fearful of humans. All three were adopted separately, two have done well but Mimosa had some trouble adjusting and is back with us waiting on the right home. Mimosa will need a home with no small children and with an experienced owner that has experience with shy and fearful dogs. She isn't an aggressive dog just fearful of humans at first she greets all of us with playful jumps each morning and is doing very well in her foster home. She loves the company of other dogs they give her confidence and security. A home with a small dog pack is a must for this girl!!! If you would like to give Mimosa her forever home please fill out an adoption application today!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

Frankfort is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Meet Kentucky! She is about 3 years old and is possibly a Pointer mix with Cattle Dog or something equally confident and athletic. Kentucky came to Labs and More pregnant and was a great mom, but now this sweet girl is ready to put parenthood behind her and find a forever home! She is house trained in her foster home and is a quick learner and food motivated. She is learning not to jump up on people to say hello and may knock little children over, but it's only because she's excited to make new friends. She knows \"sit\" and \"down.\" Kentucky walks well on leash, but is learning to ignore other dogs on walks. She can be choosy with her dog friends - some she likes to play with and some she isn't so sure about. We think she'd be happiest as the only dog in her forever home. She has met dog savvy cats and just turned the other way, but she does like to chase birds and bunnies on walks so may chase a cat that runs. Kentucky is a very active girl. She loves to play fetch and is very agile. She will need a secure fence in her home and supervision in the backyard because she can scale a retaining wall like a mountain climber. She would be an awesome new hiking companion and jogging partner. After expelling her energy, she is always down for a snuggle session with her humans. She bonds closely to her people and is an affectionate girl. She is a good guard dog with a booming bark when strangers come to the front door but once she sees you are a friend, she happily wags her tail. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Kentucky, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life! Dogs + Love = Family",

            "description": "***All animals listed on our website are in private foster homes. To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nWeight 45 lbs\n\n**Single family home needed**Must have a fenced back yard**Must be an experienced dog owner**Prefer a home with a small-med size, low-med energy doggie friend** HIGHLY RECOMMEND foster-to-adopt due to special needs**\n\nMeet Nugget! While not a lot is known about his past, it is clear that there was significant trauma. Nugget is very apprehensive with people and new situations, especially at first. He builds trust slowly through consistency and gentle interactions. He needs an understanding, PATIENT, and loving home with a family that understands he may always be skittish and shy away from human touch.\n\nNugget is a quirky little dude. He likes to help with a pre-wash on the dishes in the dishwasher, he hoards all the dog toys in his bed and has been known to try to nibble on his people's toe nails. Despite the toe nail nibbling, Nugget is very gentle and good with children. Nugget loves hard chew bones, toys with squeakers and really enjoys a good remote control. Nugget is easily summoned with food and he loves fresh fruit, veggies and cheese. He likes to sit patiently next to the dinner table, just in case someone might offer him a taste.\n\nNugget can be brought out of his shell with a doggie friend to romp around with indoors. He seems to do best with small to medium sized dogs that have low to medium energy. Nugget likes to wrestle and is vocal during play as well. Nugget isn't playful all day but has several bouts of feistiness. Having a well-trained doggie friend/leader in the home might also speed up the trust and learning process. The more he watches a human pet, play, and talk to other dogs in the home, the more he is interested in getting to know that human. The other dog will also give Nugget a sense of safety.\n\nNugget isn't a huge fan of being outside. He has learned to overcome his fear of outside enough to potty out there, but he is still working on learning a signal to alert that he needs to go out. He's not crazy about walking through doorways and currently needs to be led outside to the yard by leash but then unleashed once outside. He will follow a family member into the yard, do his business, and then want to go right back inside. Due to his fear, he isn't great walking on a leash and often pulls to the extreme to find a spot he feels safe (crouched in the bushes or under a car). For this reason, a home with a fenced backyard is important.\n\nNugget's forever home will have an owner who is patient. This means they will have to let him decide things on his own and try not to force him into too many situations too fast. Owning Nugget will not be like owning a regular dog. You won't be able to show him off to all of your family and friends right away and you especially won't be able to cuddle him right away. It can be hard to resist, but Nugget will need a confident owner who puts up boundaries around human interaction until it is clear he is comfortable. Nugget has been in foster care for 8 months (as of Jan 2021) and has made significant progress, but he is still a long way from being a normal house pet. He may NEVER be a normal house pet, but we hope that someone will love him for who he is.\n\nMedication to manage Nugget's anxiety has been key in the process of building trust with him. Before meds, he was too nervous to really interact at all. Nugget's new family will need to be understanding and attentive. They will need to understand his triggers for fear and find new approaches to situations. For example, since he will be scared when you take him home, it will be essential for Nugget to have a crate or safe place identified that is close to the family but not in a high traffic area. He will need gradual exposure to your presence. It would be best if the new owner was someone who spends most of their time at home and is willing to have Nugget within ear shot. The key to earning his trust will be building his confidence that you are going to feed him and give him water daily and take him outside to do his business. Consistency will also help him know early on what is expected so he can start to grow into a dog who has confidence in himself.\n\nNugget might sound like a lot of work but when he finds his forever home with an owner who works hard to establish trust, it will be a bond unlike any other. Nugget is crate trained, neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, has been microchipped and dewormed, and is current on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. His adoption fee is $300. If you think he may be the one, please go ahead and send in an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. If you have any questions about Nugget, please contact the Dog Program Manager at laura@secondchancenc.org.",

            "description": "Sadie is a beautiful female Dutch Shepherd around 9 years young. Sadie was confiscated by animal control after being found in a hot vehicle over the summer where she was kept in a dirty crate and was severely overweight. Sadie has clearly had a rough few years but she is looking forward to having a home of her own.\n\nSadie is a very sweet girl who is friendly with new people although not always super social. She can be aloof at first but once she realizes that someone is offering her attention she tends to melt into them. Sadie has been wonderful for all of the extra attention she needed when she arrived - tolerating medication, extra bathing, and pampering. She is a no-fuss sort of girl though and thinks that it is a bit much. She is happy to just be near you doing her own thing while you do hers. She is starting to warm up to the idea of asking for attention but isn't super affectionate. She has a few tendencies that speak to her past of being confined such as circling when overwhelmed or darting to corners when she isn't sure where she is supposed to go. Sadie has met an 8 year old and done well but we would not currently recommend her for a home with younger children.\n\nSadie is able to get along with other dogs in her foster home but is not a dog oriented girl herself. She will reprimand dogs that get in her space and don't respect her boundaries. She much prefers to keep herself away from the other dogs but is able to navigate shared space with the other dogs. Sadie would do best as an only dog or in a home with other respectful, senior dogs. Sadie has not met any smaller dogs or cats at this time.\n\nSadie is heartworm positive and has begun 'slow kill' treatment for her heartworm which will need to continue in the form of monthly Ivermectin in her adoptive home. We would be happy to answer any questions you have about treating heartworm and also encourage contacting your vet to discuss adopting a heartworm positive dog.\n\nSadie is searching for a patience and loving home that will help her continue to settle into life as a loved family member. If you're the home for Sadie please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit Tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs",

He can be a bit shy at first but before long he is all wags and wiggles. Walter also lights up when he sees kids so he can be placed in a home with children over 5. Walter has allergies and is on special food. His skin can get red and itchy so medicated baths help. He is crate trained but will need reinforcement in house training. Walter will make a wonderful companion for the right family that is willing to maintain his skin and have patience while he masters house training.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Walter please first fill out the online adoption application at www.greatpets.org. Once your application has been received and reviewed you will be contacted to discuss if he is a good fit for your home. Walter's $250 adoption donation includes his vet examination, neuter surgery, vaccinations, flea treatment and microchip.\n",

I am mostly black with a smattering of white. My foster tells me all the time (seriously, ALL THE TIME) what a smart guy I am, and there is a special family out there that would be lucky to have me.\n\nI love spending time outdoors smelling all the things, rides in the car, and food! I\u2019m fast, and love to run around outside and activate my turbo switch for zoomies at least once a day. I would be ecstatic if my new family had a fenced-in yard for me to run around in. I am excited about new things, and love to go on adventures; just grab your keys - I\u2019m ready! I am very food-motivated and already know several commands: sit, down, spin, and high-five. I do have wonderful manners, I take treats like a gentleman, and sit for my food bowl to be put down. I don\u2019t have any dogs at my foster home, but I really think I would like to have a furry brother or sister to run around with outside and play the day away. Also, cats and I don\u2019t see eye-to-eye\u2026I guess they really don\u2019t like to be chased so I will need a cat-free home. I think a family without children would be best because I am still young and can be mouthy.  I\u2019m a bit slow to fully trust, so adults with patience to give me time and space would help.  Don\u2019t let that fool you though, I LOVE attention, and I will be all over you if you let me lead.\n\nI don\u2019t care for a crate, but after some adjustment time I\u2019ve become comfortable being loose at home alone for a few hours.  I\u2019d like my new family to have someone who is home most of the day, but if you\u2019re patient with me we can keep working on this.  My foster says it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t have bed and furniture privileges as I have shown resource guarding behavior with them.  I am already potty-trained.  \n\nThis dog MUST HAVE:\nNo cats\nNo children\nFenced in yard\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact LOLIN for a meet and greet.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.lolin.org and click on Adoption Process along the left-hand side.  From there, you can submit an Adoption Application to be considered for this dog.  You MUST be an approved applicant to meet LOLIN dogs.  There is no central location or hours to meet dogs.",

AN APPROVED APPLICATION IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT A SPONSORED DOG.\n\nWe do require an approved application at this time to set up a meet and greet.\n\nIf you like big Mutts, then Hulk is your guy. This massive guy is on the hunt for his perfect furever home. He was adopted as a puppy from a partner shelter, only to be picked up with an imbedded collar several years later. He has healed great now. Hulk gets along great with other dogs, but might intimidate some by his size. Hulk absolutely will not use the bathroom in his kennel, so we believe hed catch on quickly with housebreaking. He still needs to learn how to walk correctly on a leash, but absolutely loves being outdoors of leash in a secured fenced area.\n\nKeep up with us, our events, our adoptable animals, etc on our Facebook page under Mollys Mutts Animal Rescue!

He is happiest when he is learning new games or commands outside of his run. He is intelligent and goofy. He loves to play with toys, especially if you are up for a game of fetch. He is a total water dog, too. He has made one dog friend who is understanding of his excitement. We are hopeful that his friend pool can be expanded once he is out of the shelter environment. Wyatt needs a chance to grow up and be the awesome dog we think he can be. The only way that can happen is by finding a forever home with a rock star of an adopter. Is that you? No cats Maybe dogs No children",

            "description": "Meet Bruce Banner! Bruce came from Hillsborough County AS and had to have his leg amputated so he is a gorgeous tripod. He is approx 71 pounds, 8 years old, and an Akita mix. He loves a good couch snuggle and hanging out with his foster family. He is a sweet boy that deserves the best forever home! He is house trained and very loyal. Needs to be an only dog and no kids. Bruce becomes protective of his family and Akita or other working dog experience preferred. His foster and forever home will need to be with someone willing to continue training this sweet boy.\n\nBruce Banner is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is only $225.\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.orgMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

Sorry, no exceptions.\n\n**\n\nAutumn's adoption begins with a Foster-To-Adopt arrangement that continues until she has completed Basic and Intermediate Obedience training courses; adoption can then be finalized.\n\n**\n\nAutumn is a very active, happy, and funny dog! She runs and plays for the love of moving. SHE IS AS FAST AS A ROCKET. Maybe faster - full of energy! Most of the time she is grinning, but she's a master of many expressions and being silly.\n\nAutumn is a sweetheart and an athlete, needs active guardians who are home most of the time and enjoy running and hiking daily. She would love a happy, very playful dog friend her size to help her burn off energy. Absent another dog-friend, she would enjoy a busy social life with human and dog friends to keep her busy and engaged.\n\nWe have not had the opportunity to observe Autumn with a small dog or a cat, so we must err on the side of caution and place her with a dog her size or a bit larger. :)\n\nIf you feel you are a potential match for Autumn's needs, please complete an adoption application! Please include information regarding your experience with raising and training a very young dog.\n\n\t\"Companion animal\" means, needs at least one other friendly, playful dog that lives full-time in the same household.\n\t\"Fenced yard\" means, a backyard that is adjacent to and connected with your residence. (It does not mean a nearby fenced area/dog park.)\n\tGates must have padlocks and thresholds (cement or buried pavers to prevent digging.)\n\tYard and patio must be free of debris and have room for dogs to run and play on a lawn and/or a very shaded area. Please don't invite us to your home if you've not yet landscaped your yard!\n\tWe do not place dogs in situations where there are \"drained\" or empty swimming pools, which are a fall hazard and contribute to the propogation of mosquitos.\n\tLast and not least, we DO NOT adopt to students as we have found that they often do not know or anticipate where life is taking them next.\n\nDiscussion about a dog - including scheduling of a home check or other dialogue - cannot occur until we have received your completed adoption application. NO EXCEPTIONS. Thank you!",

I am a 2 year old, neutered male, Shepherd mix that weighs about 55 pounds. \n\nI have a whole lot of puppy left in me and I am still learning my manners with 2 legged and 4 legged friends. I am a silly boy that loves to play and like people big and small but would probably do best with ages 10 and up. I also get along well with cats. I am a high energy boy that will need quite a bit of exercise. I know to go potty outside, I can sit, lay down, wait for my food, and I am getting pretty good on my leash.  I am VERY smart so something to keep my mind challenged would be helpful too.\n\nMy forever family should have previous dog experience and some patience to help me continue learning how to behave like the beautiful, smart boy I am.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as an adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our process includes landlord approval and vet checks. We try to get applications processed in a timely fashion. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and possibly cancel your application from being processed, so please make sure that you include valid information and contact information. You will be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions. Once your application has been processed, you may be contacted by one of our volunteers to set up a home visit interview. After your home visit interview is completed, all of your information is reviewed. If your application is approved, you will be notified. Meet and greets with dogs are only set up with approved applicants, so if you want to meet a dog, it is vital that your home visit is completed and that your application is approved. Adoption fees generally are: \n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test and prevention (if old enough) and veterinary inspection certificate. Breeds of dogs are best guesses and we don't guarantee any breed. Adopters are chosen by what situation will be best for the dog. Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen to adopt that dog. Lucky Mutts strives to match dogs to the best home and will work with your family to find a good match. Please remember that we are an organization that is completely run by volunteers, so please be patient as many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thanks for wanting to adopt!",

            "description": "David is a stunningly handsome male pittie mix estimated at 1-2 years old. He was found abandoned with another dog and both were taken to Chicago Animal Control and placed into separate foster homes with us. We don\u2019t know David\u2019s past, but we know it can\u2019t have been pleasant. He is slow to trust and initially had only one or two people he would let into his circle. Since being in our care, he has had extensive training and continues working on widening his circle daily and is really making great strides. \n\nHowever, because of what was most likely an abusive past, David should go to a home with no other dogs, pets, or children. When it comes to his adults though, he is the best cuddle buddy around! Once you\u2019re in his circle, he loves his people so much and wants to get and give constant attention. He is just the sweetest dog, most affectionate dog, and somehow gets sweeter by the day! He is fully potty trained and does not have accidents in the house. He walks politely on the leash. He is responding well to training and knows basics like \u201csit,\u201d \u201cwait,\u201d \u201cstay,\u201d and \u201cplace.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not learning new tricks and how to be a very good boy, David is being an excellent travel buddy! He immediately goes to his place in the backseat and safely sits down. He enjoys having the window down and watching the world go by and is always ready for new adventures. Just be careful when you get those car keys out to go somewhere without him\u2026 his beautiful green eyes are hard to say no to! \n\nDavid will need continuing training and an adopter experienced with pittie-type dogs. If you think you could give David the life he deserves, please fill out a survey today at www.playersforpits.com/adoptionsurvey!\n",

I enjoy lots of attention and plenty of physical activity. A home with land would be ideal, a fenced yard is required for my adoption. Schedule an Adoption Appointment to come say hello!\n\nWeight: 75 lbs.\n\nAdoption Price: $100\n\nWANT TO TAKE ME HOME TODAY? SCHEDULE AND ADOPTION APPOINTMENT.\nTo Schedule An Adoption Appointment:\n1. Fill out and submit our online Adoption Application.\n2. Please only submit ONE Adoption Application. (Our Application is for general pre-approval, not for a specific adoptable animal).\n3. Once received, the Allen County SPCA will review your application. Applications are reviewed in the order they are received.\n4. We will contact you to let you know your Adoption Status and schedule an Adoption Appointment. Applications may take up to 1-2 days to process. Please give us a call at the shelter at 260-744-0454 if you have not heard back from us within 48 hours.\n5. If you haven't found your perfect match at the shelter, that's okay too - pre-approved applications are valid for 6 months!\n\nCome prepared! Please bring proof of a current rabies vaccine for all pets living in the home. If you have another dog, you are welcome to bring him or her with you so that we can safely perform a dog interaction.\n\nUnfortunately, animals cannot be held for you.\n\nA Special Note from the Allen County SPCA:\nRemember, pets are a lifelong commitment. We at the Allen County SPCA ask that you take adding a furry family member to your home seriously, and do your research on the different breeds before adopting. We also ask that you are able to keep up on yearly vaccinations, monthly preventatives, a good diet, daily exercise, training, and most of all, LOVE. If you ever have an issue with a pet that you adopted, please contact us right away; we may be able to help, or we can put you in touch with someone who can. All set? Come in and adopt today!",

            "description": "Meet Bowden... This little cutie originally came to us with him mom, dad and 3 siblings from a local overcrowded shelter. He was adopted as a small baby but sadly is being returned. His adopter feels a more active family with a fenced yard would be better for Bowden. Bowden is a Chi/Terrier mix. He\u2019s now 5.5 months old and weighs 6.4 lbs. We don\u2019t expect him to get over 10 lbs. Bowden is very smart. He knows sit. He will also sit at the door and wait until he\u2019s told to go out. He loves his person and wants to be with them. He is an active terrier. He loves toys, to go for walks and to play outdoors. He would benefit from a home with a fenced yard, kids and other animals. Bowden is truly great with everything. He\u2019s utd, dewormed and neutered.\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

We won\u2019t even guess at his DNA gumbo- what you see is what you get with Winston. \nWinston is a bit of a wall flower, but his personality blooms when he is around other dogs. He is not yet comfortable around young children- he has yet to figure them out, too many loud noises and unpredictable bursts of energy for Winston. He is housebroken/neutered/and heart worm negative and searching for his forever home. He can be seen daily at The Adoption House. Apply to adopt in person or online at fotabr.org/adopt\n\nAll dogs adopted through Friends of the Animals are current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed or neutered prior to adoption.

He loves to cuddle, is super smart, extremely well trained (thanks to his foster mom, Allison) and is available to go home with you!\n\nRalphie was found as a stray with several tumors on his underside and scrotum, some raw and some ruptured. Those have been surgically removed and he has fully recovered. After what must have been a painful and uncertain time, he is now looking forward to finding his forever home. \n\nRalphie is around eight-years-old, loved every human he meets, and would like to be the only pet in the home. Did we mention his underbite? Can you even handle how cute it is!?\n\nRalphie was officially diagnosed with Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) on December 12th. What this meant was that Ralphie\u2019s body couldn\u2019t regulate fluids because his pituitary gland wasn\u2019t producing enough of the antidiuretic hormone called ADH, and this was what was causing his extreme thirst and excessive urination. Although there\u2019s technically no \u201ccure\u201d for CDI, there is some good news: it can be pretty easily managed with just daily oral medication. Ralphie has been on the meds for a few weeks now and the improvement is drastic! \n\nTo apply to adopt Ralphie go to handsomedansrescue.org\n\nFor questions, please email allison.k.rogers@gmail.com \n\nThank you!",

What this meant was that Ralphie\u2019s body couldn\u2019t regulate fluids because his pituitary gland wasn\u2019t producing enough of the antidiuretic hormone called ADH, and this was what was causing his extreme thirst and excessive urination. Although there\u2019s technically no \u201ccure\u201d for CDI, there is some good news: it can be pretty easily managed with just daily oral medication. Ralphie has been on the meds for a few weeks now and the improvement is drastic!",

The SPCA trainers will assist the foster to help Opal acclimate and blossom! She\u2019d do best in a quote home and a canine buddy for her to be friends with would be an added bonus!\n\nDue to Covid-19 the SPCA is allowing adoptions by appointment only. If you\u2019d like to discuss an animal and/or set up a meet and greet please email shelter@spca914.org with your competed application and a copy of your driver\u2019s license or a government issued ID. Please allow up to 72 hours for a response!

She is house-trained and crate-trained. She goes into her crate on her own and loves to curl up with her blankets at night.\n\nPola loves to play with toys; her favorites are squeak toys and rope toys. She is good with other dogs, but she requires very slow introductions. She loves to go for walks and is great on a leash. She is the perfect passenger when going for car rides too.\n\nPola is quiet and rarely barks. She likes to give kisses and hang out near you when you are home. Pola loves treats and takes them very gently from your hand.\n\nShe is very sweet and such a good girl. Pola wants to be YOUR best friend!

            "description": "BENDI - 5 years old, 51 lbs, Spayed Female, Heeler Mix, Medium Active Home - DOG EXPERIENCE ONY \n\n\"Weird, Wonky and Beautiful\" .... as her foster mom put it! She really hit the nail on the head!! Bendi has a head tilt that was due to an old nasty ear infection. She also has wonky hips - she clearly wasn't super well taken care of in her past life. We assume she just lived outdoors. There is something about this large goofball that really just makes you fall in love with her. She is currently being fostered by a professional trainer - that has helped her with her urge to nip (breed related). Bendi is a dog that wasn't trained as a young lady so she had a lot of learning to do when she came to NYC. She is learning her manners well. Bendi really really loves to play whether that be with another young submissive dog or with her toys. Her foster momma has taught her how to play with a \"flirt pole\"... which tickles our fancy and seems very appropriate for Bendi. Bendi needs to be in an adults only home. NO cats. She is good with other submissive dogs - but does have an urge to hump them at first. Bendi would also do best out of the city - city noises spook her.Interested in adopting? Please go to www.socialteesnyc.org \n\nHer Foster Mom Says: \"Bendi is a sweet girl who loves attention and play. She is always hanging out nearby or resting at our feet. She enjoys wrestling, belly rubs, chewing her toys, bird watching and is a keen student. She's a lot of fun and introduced us to a game of paw slapping and she really enjoys short sessions with a flirt pole. She does best with a good amount of exercise, but nothing too intense. She currently gets an 1hr walk in the morning and at lunch time plus toilet breaks in the evening. She gets spooked by noisy traffic and would do best in a quiet neighborhood. She has a few quirks that present themselves when she's anxious, so she needs a home that is committed to continuing reward based training to help show her the world isn't a scary place. She can be mouthy during play, but she isn't hurting us and she's learning that play stops when she nips people. Instead she is learning to bring her toys to us for play time. She's doing well with hand targeting and making progress with sit and down. She sleeps well during the night on her bed in our bedroom. We've left her at home alone on a couple of occasions for 2-3hrs and she's been happy to work away at her Kong then have a nap. She's weird, wonky and wonderful.\"\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

I lost my owner and my sister through no one's fault so I get anxious about being alone. I love to play with my foster fur brothers. In my new home, I must have another fur sibling! I spend my days hanging out wherever my foster mom is and take a nap. Sometimes I know she needs a break so I come and ask for some pets. Occasionally, I get lonely and I let you know by howling or softly whining but if you just talk to me or give me a hug it helps. I can't wait to find my new home!\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from Lab Rescue OK!\n\nThe FIRST STEP in the adoption process is to fill out a Adoption Application at www.labrescue.net.\n\nProcessing of a application usually takes 5-7 days. \n\n*** Labs are not placed on a first come, first approved basis. Placement is at the discretion of Lab Rescue OK, Inc ***",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Daisy Marie\n\nBreed: Cattle Dog/Heeler (or mix)\n\nApproximate Age: 8 months - 1 yr\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight: around 40 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nDaisy Marie came to us from Texas hoping she can find the perfect home. She is a sweet gal, right now she is a little shy but friendly. She is all ready to be adopted and find out how great life can be as a loved family pet. Her foster home in Texas helped her learn to walk on a leash and to trust people. Even though she is scared right now, she still wants to be petted and loved. If interested in Daisy Marie, please fill out the pre-adoption application. We don't have a background on her, so don't know if she lived with other pets or children or if she was housetrained (many dogs from Texas have lived outside the majority of their lives).\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS\n2/2/21 6:06 PM",

I get along with some other dogs and I would do well with children that play nice with me! I would need to have supervision with any cats that may be in my new home to make sure that I want to be friends with them! I am your typical husky and I do like to talk and howl! I would like to have a nice bed and some toys that I can call my very own! I walk nice on a leash so it would be so much fun to get out and see all of the sights and sounds!

Thanks for that.\n\nTo start our adoption process, please fill out our form on our web site at: www.spokanewienerdogs.org and see the Adopt a Dog/Fee page with more details on how we adopt our dogs. There are a lot of questions answered on our web site and personality details below about each dog BELOW so please READ BEFORE getting in touch. We already answer 500+ emails a day.  We do answer questions on dogs once our adoption paperwork is filled in so we can match to the right homes.    \n\nPlease indicate which dog you are interested in on our adoption form.  If their name says \"pending home\" then they are not available and are on a test drive with a new family.  We do remove our dogs when our adoptions are final so please do not ask us if dogs are available if you see their ads.\n\nThere is an adoption fee of $300 for this dog.\n\nSweets is a very sweet, shy dog who is cautious meeting new people but it only took her a few days to warm up to us.  She is in rescue through no fault of her own.\n\nShe would apprciate a home with no kids and adults only who have patience to work with her and bribe her some.  If you have another small dog in the home would be ideal.  Her daughters have been doing all the thinking for her and it is time she grew up and was placed in a home without them.  She was crated a lot in her last home so she is learning all sorts of new things with us.\n\nThis very affectinate dog will be spayed soon and we will update her shots then when we get a vet appointment.   She is a bit overweight right now but on a diet and should finsih around 8 pounds.\n\nFor right now we are keeping her in a smaller yard and dragging a leash so easily caught but wil graduate to a larger yard soon.\n\nShe is so tiny we suspect there is probably some chihuahua in her background but she has a docked tail and ears so we are goong with the breed we were told.  Either way she is a very, sweet dog no matter what is in her woodpile.\n\nWe have already wormed her and started socializing her right away as well as started the weaning process from daughters too so she will be more than ready for adoption soon.  They need to be in different homes and not placed together.\n\nIf you have tiny kids under age 8 in your home then they would be way too much for her, no other small dogs and no fence as well as no patience to retrain a scared new dog then this girl is not for you.",

            "description": "Mayetta is new to Beauties and has only been with her foster a short time. She is sweet and playful. very loyal and loving but also a little too possessive of her person and her \"things. She was initially cool with the other dogs in her foster home, but then started getting growly and snappy toward them. She corrects very easily, laying right down and exposing her belly. Mayetta is very playful like a puppy and needs to learn manners. She does not seem to understand that she can't jump up on people. She tolerates being kenneled but doesn't like it. She loves to be close to her human, and is most comfortable lying near them with w a paw on them for security. She needs a lot of reassurance. She wants to play with the cats but way too rough and they don't want anything to do with her. However she does ignore the chickens in ehr foster home. She does fine on the leash. Mayetta looks exactly like a chocolate lab, but is the shape of a dachshund. Her paperwork says she is around 35 lbs. She is a solid 35 lbs. \n\nMayetta's foster says that despite her guarding behavior, with the right leadership and home she is going to make a great companion for someone!!",

During our assessments we saw no reason for this handsome boy to die and so now he is with us and looking for a foster or forever home!

Before he was rescued, Landry spent most of his life outdoors on a chain, often going hungry when his mealtime was forgotten, and spending many lonely hours all alone.\n\nSince his rescue, Landry has adapted great to indoor living, and has developed great house manners.  He is loving with his foster peeps, but tends to be aloof with strangers.\n\nLandry does well with other dogs, but he will vociferously warn them away from his resources.  This is easily managed in his foster home, but Landry might be most content as an only dog.\n\nLandry enjoys walks, but tends to be strong and random on a leash.  He would probably do best with a fenced yard.\n\nLandry is 4.5 yo and weighs about 50 lbs.  He is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and screened for parasites.  He recently completed heartworm treatment and convalescence.  His adoption fee is $300 cash and he is eligible for foster foster-to-adopt within the Chicago metro area.\n\nFor more information and an adoption application, please email UnderdogRailway@yahoo.com\n\n***we take.

We cared for him as he fought for his life, gave him back his sight thanks to cataract surgery, and Mr Rogers is now healthy, happy, energetic and ready for his second miracle: finding his forever home.\nYes he needs an insulin injection and some pills with each meal, but don't let that scare you. Mr Rogers is so much more than that. He is so strong and a true symbol of hope. He loves going on walks and to the dog park, gets along great with other dogs, loves car rides, doesn't bark and he is 100% potty trained! Doesn't he sound perfect?? We didn't give up on this little angel so he could have a shot at life, a chance at happiness. We've done our part. Now it's your turn to show this angel that he is so worthy of love! DOB 2/20/2010\n\n Adoption fee is $250 and includes DHPP; rabies vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, wellness vet visit one month of pet insurance and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application; https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/ if you would like to adopt or meet this dog and we will be in touch right away!",

If you like to Hike, Swim, Play, and want an adventurer who loves to be by your side for all of it, Rowan is your girl!\n\nAlthough Rowan is crate trained, she is not suited for the city or apartment life. She needs a family and partner who loves adventures and doesn't mind her tagging her along. Rowan is extremely intelligent and will thrive with a mix of both mental and physical stimulation. If you are not the type of person who enjoys walking, hiking, and a high activity lifestyle, she is not the dog for you\n\nRowan is a balance of 50% Belly Rubs & 50% Bounce!\n\nRowan loves children and everyone she meets. She will do just about anything for a good cuddle & snack. Girl after our own hearts! So if you'd like to add a little bit of adventure to your life, with a side of snuggle. She is the dog for you!\n\nRowan is Deaf (but unless we told you that, youd never know!). She makes a great thunderstorm companion, and will sit beside you for an outdoor firework show instead of hiding from them.\n\nWORKING BREED EXPERIENCE PREFERRED.\n\nYou can fill out an application at www.anarchyanimalrescue.org. Rowan is completely healthy, spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped and currently being fostered in Long Island, New York.\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: ALL ADOPTERS MUST BE LOCATED WITHIN 120 MILE RADIUS & MUST HAVE A FULLY FENCED YARD FOR ANY DEAF DOG, IF THE DOG WILL HAVE YARD ACCESS. There are NO exceptions to this, as recall is a huge concern should the dog ever mistakenly get loose.*** 11/10/20 2:58 PM",

            "description": "Meet Frontier! He is a 2-year-old Schnauzer/terrier mix. He is currently in foster and is loving life. Here is a summary from his foster mom: \"\"Frontier is affectionate, cuddly, and incredibly loving! He is very high energy. He will require training for leash reactivity as he does pull and bark and gets dog-obsessive when he sees them on walks. But he's super smart, so with some structure he should be fine :) He can be dominant and intrusive with other dogs, though he did live with other dogs before, and he is such an angel indoors. He is very attached to his people. Ideally I can see him in a house with kids, a backyard to get his energy out throughout the day, and people that will be able to exercise him. His positive attributes like cuddliness and calmness inside are bonus points after you can handle the hard stuff. He is not leash trained and doesn't know most basic commands. But the good news is, he is housebroken and successfully learned how to sit within a few days! He wants to be a sidekick and be everywhere you are.\"\" Frontier is a nice compact size. Though he's currently 23 pounds, his foster family is working on getting him closer to 28 for his ideal weight. With some basic training, Frontier is primed to be some lucky family's BFF for life!To initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

This inquisitive boy just wants to know if you're as fun-loving as he is. If so, this playful young boy will want to be your new best friend! This sweet guy can be your goofy playmate. He loves chewing on his stuffed squeaky toys and is becoming such a good fetcher. And he's a smart pup who's responding very well to his training, working on his leash skills. Plus, he is already a smart house- and crate-trained pup. Eeyore was in an accident months ago that left him with a broken leg. He's now fully recovered with no limp. He just hopes for a low-traffic home with a loving adult who promises to keep him safe and teach him that the world is not so scary. Come meet this adorable boy!",

He lost his home when his family had a daughter with a newborn baby move in, the mom didn't want Wally around. He is a strong boy but he is great with people. He loves to snuggle up with a blankie and he loves to play with stuffies! He would make an awesome companion for the right person. Could that be you?\n\nFor more information on Wally, or to set up a meet and greet, please call or text Ginny at 954-295-7536 between 7pm and 10pm. You can also fill out an application on our website at www.doberescue.net.\n\n*Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer run organization.

I was born there and abandoned as a puppy.  I was living in a crowded shelter as a dog whose breed is basically illegal there.\n\nI was rescued, received my vaccinations, and even have my very own passport!\n\nAs a result of my negligent upbringing and life in the shelter, I was always scared there.  Scared of what would happen to me and scared because I never received much attention and never felt love.  I sure do love my foster Mom though!  I've learned to trust her and now she tells me it's time for me to trust others and find my forever home.\n\nI know it's probably going to be a long process, but I also know that I am VERY willing to try and I DEFINITELY want my very own forever home.  So - if you promise to take it slow with me, I promise to try really hard to make any meeting a potential match.\n\nI am a VERY sweet girl ever but I just need to gain some self confidence  I've been around other dogs and interacted well with them.  \n\nI won't be adopted out into an environment with children under the age of 16.  I am not used to the activity levels of children and will not do well with a lot of noise and quick movements.\n\nI've been spayed, am heartworm negative and am up to date with vaccinations.  My adoption fee is $250. \n \nTo request an adoption application, please visit https://www.udranch.org/contact.  Please allow 24-48 hours for a response!",

She is so beautiful and deserves to have a loving family that has the patience to be with her. She has been in boarding waiting for a very long time, she would love to have her own bed and yard.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please text 480-359-7109 visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

I am currently crated when left home alone at my foster home.\nI am a social girl who loves men and women! I haven't been around small children. I will actively seek attention and love being pet. I love to cuddle with my humans. I will happily welcome visitors into our home!\nI do not get along with other dogs and need to be the only dog in my home. I like my toys and have been practicing playing fetch with large toys! I would benefit from a fenced yard where I can explore safely off-leash. I cannot go to a home with cats.\nI have learned how to walk well on the leash and am not reactive to other dogs walking by us. I am a smart girl who has learned the verbal commands for sit, up, down, and come. I am an active, high energy girl who would love a family who will take me out for long walks, hikes, or swims-I like swimming around my foster family's pool! I ride well in the car.\nI have a degenerative eye disease called pannus, so my eyesight is compromised. I can see well enough to get around on my own most of the time but will occasional bump into the things and struggle with depth perception. I receive eye drops to help prevent progression of my vision loss which will need continued for life. Dogs with pannus can also be sensitive to UV lighting and I may benefit from goggles during long outdoor outings. My vision doesn't slow me down at all and I still love to run and play!\nI am a happy, loving girl who'd love to find my perfect family where I can be the center of attention are you my family?\nFollow me on Facebook: #EchoDogJenny\nFor more information, please contact adoptions@echodogs.org.\n\nEcho Dogs fosters dogs in many states. Visit www.echodogs.org/available-dogs to see more of our dogs. Transportation for the adopted dog IS available. Remember, we are an all-volunteer foster rescue organization - we DO NOT have a physical shelter to visit. Our minimum adoption donation is $300. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Puppies under 6 months old may not be spayed/neutered. This would be the responsibility of the adopter at their own expense. Proof of spay/neuter will be required!\nTo review our adoption procedure and submit an online application, visit: www.echodogs.org/procedure 2/2/21 9:46 AM",

They are enjoying each other\u2019s company and have discovered how much fun it is to play with toys!  They act like typical Boxers, although Bullet (7 yrs old) is Blind.  He leans on Marley (5 yrs old) for guidance and support and they are definitely a bonded pair.  They play, eat, and sleep together.  \n\nThey are both housebroken and they are fed in their crates, and spend some time in their crates with bully sticks or Kongs, although they definitely prefer to be with their humans.  They enjoy a comfortable couch, fluffy blankets and pillows! At this time, it would be recommended to crate them (separately) if leaving the house for a longer period of time.\n\nBullet (male, blind) can see lights and shadows, and is very good at following your voice.  Bullet had a consultation with an eye doctor, and unfortunately, he is not a candidate for surgery to regain his vision.\n\nMarley is protective of Bullet and she is a vocal gal!  They are both jealous if one is getting attention and not the other. Their foster mom says they enjoy romping around, going outside, and then relaxing on the couch, and they LOVE treats, they are definitely food motivated.  They are not a fan of going out in the rain!\n\nIf you are interested in Bullet and Marley, connect Barbara to learn more about me. BarbaraABoxer@gmail.com\n\nBullet - Age: 7 - Special Needs Blind\nMarley - Age: 5 \nDogs: No\nCats: No\nKids: 15+ - Just because he is special Needs and he hasn't been with kids\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Joy, a gorgeous Alaskan Malamute mix who weighs about 63 lbs. She is considered a med-high energy dog and she knows the 'sit' command. She can be a bit mouthy and stubborn at times and will need a patient family to work on training with her. Northern breeds can be quite vocal, so apartment living may not be the best fit for her. She would make a great exercise partner! No cats or young kids please!!\n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about Joy on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/ Ask to meet me today!!\n \nAdoption fee: $475.00\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application.

ADR is not responsible for the health, temperament, behavior or placement of this dog. Listings are done at the request of the dog's owner and as an outreach and community service in hopes of finding these dogs a loving, stable forever home. Placement decisions are made solely at the discretion of the owner and not Austin Dog Rescue. Owners are required to ask for an adoption fee from adopters.\n\nThis is the information that we received from Mama's current foster:\n\nWe found a dog on 9/14. She is very sweet. We have posted her on several sites trying to find the owners, but with no luck. She is not micro-chipped or spayed. Our vet said she is between 1 1/2 - 2 years old. She had a litter around 4-6 months ago, and just finished a heat cycle. She is heartworm- negative, but has hook worms. We got her the medicine to treat it. We will try to get her spayed and vaccinated while she is with us and when we get the funds. She seems housetrained, loves to play fetch and is good with dogs and people. She's not the best with little kids as she may accidentally knock them down. She needs more time and activity than we can give her, but I only want her to go to a loving and safe home. Please help us find someone to adopt her. We can try to foster until this happens. I don't want to drop her at a shelter. Thank you!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this sweet lady, please contact Shana at: shanlee71@yahoo.com",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Christine (ChristineOFP@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Trooper's adoption donation is $350 and he is being fostered in Central Ohio. He has been neutered, microchipped, received his rabies, distemper/parvo, bivalent canine influenza, and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms, started on prevention as well as flea prevention and had a dental.\n\nTrooper came into rescue originally as a puppy, was adopted, and then returned due to unforseen circumstances in his adoptive home. He is one of our special needs dogs as he was born blind. While he has known nothing different when it comes to sight and manages very well in his normal world, he will have some requirements in his forever home. He does well on housetraining if kept on a schedule and gets along with the foster dogs in his foster home. Due to his blindness, he is more sensitive to sound and is sometimes reactive if startled so it will be important to make him aware when approaching him. He can also be protective of his person at times so a new home that is skilled in these behaviors will be important. We have found that he prefers women over men so will give preference to a female only home and no children. Trooper is a little shy when meeting new people but once he has gained your trust, he will be your doting companion. While he can tend to get get under foot often, he is a loving cuddler.\n\nTrooper does like to play and will engage with other dogs but at times can be a bit bossy. Due to his blindness, he would do better with dogs similar size to him to avoid unintended injury. Trooper does NOT do well with cats. Trooper really enjoys going on walks but also really likes to check out smells. Trooper does engage in a frequent spinning behavior, whether he is happy, nervous, hungry, wants to go outside, etc. He has done this since he was a puppy. He gets nervous in thunderstorms but a thunder shirt and cuddling helps him feel better. Trooper has seasonal allergies and at times requires Benadyl and medication for his eyes due to irritation.\n\nTrooper's ideal home will be a quieter home with adults and either no dogs or similar sized dogs. The home should be a ranch or willing to consistently use gates at the stairs. We will also require his forever home to have a strong veterinary history and dog behavior experience.\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur Adoption Process\n\nThe adoption process has several steps involved.\n\nPlease review prior to submitting an application.\nOur adoption process is detailed here:\n\nhttp://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption\n\nOur volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs.\n\nSpecial Requirements\n\nSome dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a \"strong vet reference\" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.\n\nThe first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home.\nNo application is approved prior to the home visit being done.\nAt that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs.\n\nOut of State Adoptions\n\nWe do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer.\nWe do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.\n\n2/1/21 8:03 PM",

She is very quiet and laid back, and enjoys following you around the house observing everything you are doing. She loves to be held in your arms but is not big on sitting on your lap, however, she does like to sit next to you. She loves to have her head and ears petted. She is crate trained, and for the most part potty trained. She is not one to tell you when she has to potty so as long as you take her out on a regular basis, she will not have any accidents in the house. When in her crate, she has never had an accident (she is crated while we are at work and at night to sleep). She loves being outside and her favorite activity is trying to catch lizards. She is great with other dogs, particularly those that are up in age without much energy (her and our 8 year old chi mix get along great). She is fascinated with our cats and runs to look for them. She is big on getting treats, especially cheese. She is an absolute doll for anyone looking for a loving, quiet, laid back companion.",

            "description": "Jackson aka Jax #6800 is a handsome 1.5-year-old male Pointer mix. He is a sweet and loving young man who loves all people. He will happily jump up and give you kisses if you\u2019d like! Jackson is house and crate trained. He knows the commands: sit and stay. He walks well on leash. He does fine meeting other dogs out on walks, but will need a slow introduction to any future roommates. He has very high energy and would love a home with a fenced-in backyard, or dedicated daily exercise. Jackson walks great on a leash. He would do best in an all adult family or older teenage children.  He weighs 60 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We are working on crate training and socialization. Just like any puppy, this pup will need a loving home with an adopter that has the time to commit to continued puppy training to assist with house, leash and obedience training. This pup should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure! If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities\n",

Yep I am a big boy!! I pretty much love everyone and I still like to play as you can see in one of my pictures. I didn't spend much time inside at my former home so I am still not sure about the whole pottying outside vs inside thing. I am pretty good most of the time but do still have accidents sometimes. I am also not neutered and the vet feels that at 11 years old it's ok if I'm not. If my new family prefers to have that done then that can be discussed at the time of adoption, I am good with other dogs and with kids. I have not been around cats as far as my rescue knows but I might be ok, We would have to test that and see. I am a big sweet boy with a lot of life left in me so don't let my age deter you. \nIf you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will respond as soon as we are able to.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam. Neuter as well if that becomes necessary",

Most of our dogs come from high kill shelters across the country or are strays, so sadly, we do not normally have any background information on them.....but we work very hard to get to know each and every dog brought into our program. We do not take animals with aggression problems (some may not like other dogs, cats, or may require older kids as opposed to younger children, but we will let you know everything that we know) most of these beautiful dogs have been faithful and loving family pets for their entire lives, yet still have lost their homes and families through no fault of their own. If you are interested in opening your heart and home to one of these amazing dogs please fill out our adoption application at\n\nhttps://www.lostballcaninerescue.org/adoption-application\n\nand we will be in touch after we get it processed. If you don't hear from us in 3 days, please send us a gentle reminder and one of us will get right on it. Please indicate the dog you are interested in meeting, where it says preference on the application!

Her savior took her to a temporary foster home that night and soon thereafter was welcomed in her permanent foster home.  There she has a Foster Mom, three Furry siblings (2 large dogs and a 19 year old Kitty) whom she had warmed up to quite nicely.  \n \nLiberty was taken to the vet who thought she might be 10ish years old.  She has vision issues as well as some hearing loss.  Comfortable in her foster home, Liberty has been catching up on her rest and loves to have the fan blowing on her.  Naps, car rides and leisurely strolls are favorite past times for this gentle girl.",

He has been through professional training due to past experiences; however, he requires a women only, no children, and no other animal household. He is crate trained, house trained, and knows several commands. He needs an experienced dog owner who will continue working with him. Although he is absolutely adorable, he needs an owner who won\u2019t give in to his looks and puppy eyes. He needs to continue using the commands he has learned, and would enjoy being taught even more tricks. \n\nHe has lots of love to give and enjoys going on walks as well as playing with his ball.

I\u2019m a lover and I\u2019ll spend hours with my head in your lap. I'm a 2 year old Pointer mix and weigh about 55 pounds.\n\nI am completely house broken and do well in my crate, sleeping through the night. I am food motivated, and I learn new commands quickly. I have an amazing nose, and I can get distracted with a lot of new smells. Because of this, I need to work on my leash training as I am strong and I can pull hard. The ideal leash training would start in a fenced in yard that I know well, and would expand my walks as I learn not to pull. Speaking of yards- I love to romp and will even throw my toys to myself, showing off some impressive coordination!\n\n I really like people, but young children can overwhelm me so families with children 8 years or older please.   \n\n.Like many rescue dogs, I'm heartworm positive.  But I'm not showing any symptoms and I'm so young that my heartworm load should be fairly light. I\u2019ve been on treatment since December and have finished my antibiotics.\n\nUnderdog Ranch uses the slow-kill method of heartworm treatment which includes a round of antibiotics, a few months of double doses of a specific heartworm preventative, and then monthly administration of yet a different specific heartworm preventative.  In 9-12 months, I should test negative.  To find out more about this - just ask my foster Moms!\n\nI've been spayed and am up to date with vaccinations.  My adoption fee is $125 and all medication for the slow-kill method of treatment will be provided.\n\nTo request an adoption application, please visit https://www.udranch.org/contact.  Please allow 24-48 hours for a response!",

Even though there is one major challenge with me, I love people and am very loving.\n\nDo you happen to be searching for a couch potato?  Look no further - I'M IT!!\n\nMy name is Penny and I'm a 3 year old Dalmatian mix girl who was rescued from a county shelter!  I weigh about 70 pounds and am a pretty chill gal.\n\nI LOVE kids, but over the age of 5 please - simply because of my size.  \n\nI will do best in a household where I am the only dog.  I do ok with small dogs, but medium sized and up I can be reactive.  I'm also not the type to go to the dog park or on walks where I may meet other dogs for the same reason.  If you have experience with dogs that need slow introductions to others, that would be great  I'm definitely not one for a first time dog owner!\n\nI love going for walks and as I mentioned above- I'm perfectly happy just chillin' on the couch!\n\nI've been spayed, am heartworm negative, and am up to date with vaccinations.  My adoption fee is $250.  \n\nTo request an adoption application, please visit https://www.udranch.org/contact.  Please allow 24-48 hours for a response!",

Elle has horrible eyesight, only peripheral vision but trust me, she can see a treat from a mile away and will do ANYTHING for it!!! We got ELLE shaved and bathed and have taught her so many things she had never known of. She truly lived her life as a prisoner. The day she slept on the dog bed instead of the floor... melted my heart. The day she climbed on the couch to sleep.... I ACTUALLY CRIED!!! EL has something going on with her hips. They give out on her occasionally. BUT I'm here to tell you, she is thriving in the loving environment we've given her! She LOVES to follow me! She actually wagged her tail at the sight of a baby I'm looking for a chilled out, patient home where someone is home most of the time. Elles older but deserves to live the rest of her time in pure love and happiness Give this sweet girl a chance! I know my family and I are so glad she came into our lives!! You will never go another without a big hug Elle style",

All he wants is snacks, naps, kisses and love.\n\nTaco's adoption fee of $350.00 includes his Vet exam, current vaccinations, flea pill, wormer, positive Heartworm and Erlichia tests, Doxycycline, heart worm treatment & preventative, neuter and microchip.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

He enjoys riding in cars looking at the scenery and walking in the woods sniffing the fallen leaves and other wonderful scents. In your neighborhood, this gentle boy will trot along nicely on a harness, glancing at the people and other dogs along the way. \n\nHe recently lost his home of three years, so he needs stability, patience, love, and a calm environment to get back to his old self. And toys! hell need lots of toys: puzzle toys, Kongs, chew toys! Rocky will do anything for treats. He loves ear massages. When you scratch his neck under his jaw, he points his nose straight up to the sky and closes his eyes. Ah, bliss! Rocky leans into you and clearly longs for affection.\n\nRocky is house trained. In your home he will either stand at the door or bark to let you know he needs to go outside. He knows how to sit and lie down, and hes learning leave it and place. He sits and waits patiently for meals. He prefers the company of adult humans. He needs time to get used to new environments. We dont know how he is with cats. \n\nPAW places animals in the Washington DC Metropolitan area only.",

He does well on off-leash walks, has not met a stranger here at the shelter that he has not liked, and is up to date on his vaccinations. Teebo may have some trouble meeting other dogs, though he has done well here at the shelter. He absolutely loves the water, playing with a ball or chew toy, and exploring new places. He loves being with people and would work best as an only dog in a loving home.\n\nPlease, give us a call at (208) 756-4100 to discuss Teebo as a new addition in your home.",

She enjoys nothing more than being with the humans she cares about, whether out for a jog, playing in the yard, or cuddling up on the couch.  Except bubbles, this girl loves to chase bubbles!!!!   She is very intelligent and eager to please, which makes her highly trainable; although, that intelligence means she needs mental stimulation. She needs a strong, confident  owner who will set boundaries without being overly harsh.  Unfortunately she was most likely not socialized properly when she was younger so the breeds natural standoffish tendency to other animals is there.  As a result she does need to be the only pet in the home.   Not to worry though she has so much love to give her people it will feel like being loved by many pets in one!  If you are looking for your one and only and want a dog that has tremendous amounts of love to give then Aires is the girl for you!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

            "description": "Meet Capricorn, a 2 year old male lab mix. He's high energy and weighs about 50 lbs. Capricorn is housebroken although when he's excited when we come home, he may have an accident. He's nervous with new people but working on that with his foster. An apartment is not ideal for capricorn but a fenced yard is. Full of energy he requires alot of busy time/running,ball chasing outside play.\n\nCapricorn loves to play fetch and tug of war. No small children as he will jump up on them knocking them down. Young and full of energy a very active and fast moving family is best. He knows sit, lay down, paw, beg and takes treats. This guy grew up without manners. Not socialized as a pup he will require slow introductions with new dogs.Capricorn is a work in progress that will need continuing work to control the triggers he has. He really needs someone experienced with dogs that were grossly neglected as a puppy.\n\nprogress. With patience and consistency he will be a great dog.\n\nI'm in a foster home, but if you are i\n\nnterested in adopting me, please fill out an online adoption application at\n\nhttp://colonycats.org/adoption_app.html\n\nto expedite the process. Due to the large number of inquiries received, we are unable to respond to emails quickly.\n\nBC",

            "description": "Hello all let me introduce myself.......I'm Eddie, a handsome, 1 year old pitty mix. I came into the shelter as a stray about 8 months ago and I was so scared. There were so many unfamiliar faces, loud noises and other dogs; I didn't know what to do. Nobody had ever trained me before or taught me how to behave. That all started to change with my shelter hooman. She spent time with me every day and we worked together to give me the skills and structure to help me deal with the stresses of shelter life. I know to go to place when it's time to go out for my walk and when I come back and to lie down, I know to sit and wait for permission with doorways and thresholds, I know good leash manners when we walk, and I am even housebroken. She tells me I give the best eyes because I look at her to make sure I'm doing what I should or if I'm not sure what to do. I do best with consistency and structure because that helps me know what is expected. I still have trouble making these decisions on my own but with this guidance I am getting better all the time. Sometimes I get excited and forget the rules but I am smart and can quickly refocus with a gentle reminder. I am working to be more patient to increase the amount of time I can stay in one position. I am sweet and spunky and have been told my expressions are priceless. I love to be outside among people being active or just relaxing and enjoying the sunshine. I notice the other animals around but they don't seem to upset me. I love the pool, peanut butter sandwiches and car rides. I have started to trust people and know what is expected which has allowed my sparkling personality to come shining through. I would do best in an adult only home, especially with experienced owners that can continue to provide me with the love and structure I need. If you think you might be my person then email dogs@hitor.org so we can start our life together.",

My favorite things are running zoomies, playing with toys, and going for walks or runs. I would love a yard to run around in, or a family that will take me out for lots of exercise! I'm still getting comfortable around other animals so I will need to be the only pet for now, while I work on my social skills. I am a very smart boy who thrives from training and mental stimulation. I will need some time to adjust to life in a home, but I love training so much, I think I can learn the house rules pretty quickly. My ideal family is one who has recent experience with energetic dogs like me and can help me acclimate to my new surroundings and loves training dogs!\nIf you are interested in meeting with me, please submit your fully completed Adoption Profile Form to adoptinquire@peninsulahumanesociety.org and an adoption counselor will call you to conduct a phone interview before making an appointment to meet in person. You must be 18 or older to submit an application. Please make sure to include in the application that you are interested in meeting me, Gorgonzola ID# A883573.\nApplication: https://phs-spca.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AdoptionProfiles_dog.pdf\nUnless otherwise indicated, adoptable animals are located at our Lantos Center for Compassion at 1450 Rollins Road, Burlingame, CA 94010. Please note at this time we are doing adoptions by appointments only. Please call us at 650-340-7022 to schedule an appointment.Our hours are weekdays from 11am-6pm and weekends from 11am-5pm (closed major holidays). Interested adopters must arrive at least 1 hour before close. We do our best to update our listings regularly, but we can't guarantee every animal you see is still available. It's also typical for us to have animals who haven't had their photos taken yet, so you are welcome to visit our adoption center and have a look around!\nTo check on an animal's adoption status, please call 650-340-7022 during normal business hours to speak with an adoption counselor. Emails will be returned as soon as possible, but please allow up to 48 hours during busy adoption periods like weekends.",

            "description": "Meet Corky! Corky came to us when his dad died & the family couldn't keep him. Corky lived his whole 12 years with his dad who was an older quiet gentleman. His days consisted of long naps in a sunny spot, lots of treats & spoiling!\nCorky is a shepherd mix & he is a senior & with that comes arthritis & knee & hip issues. His ACL is torn but due to the instability of his back end it's not advisable to fix it at his age! Corky gets pain meds every day & is able to get around fairly well. He stays close but does enjoy a very short walk to sniff & check out the neighborhood.\nCorky will need his pain meds for the rest of his years.\nHis adoption fee is $50!\nCorky would prefer a quiet home where he can binge watch Netflix & chill on a soft bed!!\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

To learn about fostering dogs like Manny, please contact us at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/volunteer/foster\n\nName: Manny\n\nBreed: Mastiff/Boxer mix\n\nApproximate Age: 1 year\n\nApproximate Weight: 80 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Local foster home\n\n \n\nMeet Manny! Manny is a happy, bouncy, 1 year old mastiff/boxer mix looking for his forever home! Manny was found wandering the streets as a stray and when no one came to claim him from the shelter, Manny became a man on the market! Manny is a big softy under it all, but he can come on a little strong and he could use some work on his manners training. Manny LOVES being around people (although he prefers to approach them on their own terms and he doesn't love it when strangers get all up in his face) and he's great with other big dogs (but sometimes needs a little redirection because he likes to try to hump them...) and would love to have a big doggy partner in crime in his forever home, but he's not always a big fan of little dogs, so he's not a great match for a family with smaller dogs.  Manny can be a little shy and skittish around loud city noises, so he would love a quiet neighborhood and a home with a fenced in yard where he can zoom around, play with his toys and relax and enjoy the calm. Manny has enjoyed some outings with his foster and is sure to make a great companion! \n \nBecause of his size, age and energy, Manny is looking for an adults only home without young children. Manny's forever family should be prepared to take him to training to help him learn how to be a good citizen, and he would benefit from some muzzle training for vet visits because he doesn't appreciate being poked and prodded by the vet.   \n \nManny needs a foster or a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on him. Please open your heart and home to Manny!\n\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $300, which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the application online at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire\n\n \n\nThank you for considering adoption and helping to save a life!\n \n\nPlease visit us online at www.DogsXLRescue.org",

Houdini has been much happier and is soaking up the companionship of his fluffy Floofy. And Floofy was separated from a dog she had bonded with. Houdini and Floofy live in the same foster home and have really hit it off with each other and hope they can be adopted together.\n\nOur normal adoption fee is $300 for a dog. They would have a reduced adoption fee of $500.00 for both dogs.\n\nFloofy, Bichon Mix, 4 yrs , 10lbs, rescued from a home that didn't take good care of her, great with dogs, full of energy, ideal home would include a four-legged playmate named Houdini, fenced yard so I can run and play, when worn out from playing, favorite place to sleep is on your lap\n\nHoudini - Chihuahua Mix, 2yrs, 11lbs,\nHoudini, when you're not looking, I might run off with your socks or a dryer sheet, a timid little guy but once he gets to know you, your constant companion. loves giving kisses, and being right beside you whether you are sitting on the sofa or cooking in the kitchen, loves snuggling under a blanket and chasing bugs in the yard or squirrels on the fence, love treats, loud noises and lots of activity can sometimes be scary, housebroken and working on leash training, best with fenced yard, adopted with Floory, a diamond in the \"ruff\", but if you can be patient, he will work his magic on your heart\n\nAdoptions to Columbus area homes only.  614-471-9000\nAll dogs and cats in the home must be spayed/neutered. \n$300 for dog adoptions        $200 for dogs 7 yrs/older \nall pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and micro-chipped\n-we have an almost paperless adoption process, we do not have an application\n-adoptions are completely pet-parent driven\n-you take the first step by calling about our pets or coming to Mingle With Our Mutts to meet the pooch you are interested in\n-once you meet, we then bring them for a home visit so you can ask questions and see the dog/cat can interact w/ your dogs/cats & family members\n-we will take them back home so your family can talk about the pet to ensure he/she is a good fit for your home\n-that's what it's all about - what is best for the dog/cat and you! \n\nAll dogs are in foster care.  No dogs are kept at our organizations office\nMeet our dogs at Mingle With Our Mutts, first and third Sundays of the month from 12-2  at the \nFranklin Co Dog Shelter, on Morse Rd, behind Menards. \nPlease email us to confirm the dog you are interested in will be there. Not all foster dogs/families can make it to every Mingle.  There will be 15 other rescues and the shelters dogs for you to visit with.\n \nPlease understand the dogs in our care live in our homes.  We become attached  and want to see them adopted to a family where we can visit to ensure the success of the adoption.  We appreciate your interest but can only adopt our dogs in Central Ohio.",

I'm a little bit of a goofball at times but that just adds to my overwhelming charisma. I'm used to being the center of attention so I need a home as the only dog.  I'm learning to walk with a leash but hey, there's a lot out in the big wide world that needs my attention.  Come see me and let's explore that big world together!\n\n \tAdopt from MCAS  \n\nAll of our dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, dogs are heartworm tested (and treated if positive), microchipped (cats are microchipped upon request) and all are current on their first round of vaccinations and rabies vaccine. \n\nWe are open 7 days a week by appointment only\n\n Adoption Center: 931-375-1402\n\n",

            "description": "Gypsy is a 10 month old Huksy mix that has had quite a difficult journey in her short life. Gypsy came into the rescue as a scared, malnourished 5 month old baby. \n\nHer anxiety resulted in compulsive chewing on her foot/ toes.  For months her foster mom provided around the clock care, bandage changes, antibiotics, cones, heart ache and struggle but she finally healed, only losing one toe. \n\nWhile her first five months of life are a mystery we do know that Gypsy developed a severe fear of men. She just graduated from Scotch Pines obedience training to help her gain confidence and manners.  This is also gives her more exposure to men in a safe environment.  While she is incredibly smart and excelling in obedience, her fear/reactivity towards men is still there. \n\nWhile Gypsy is still a diamond in the rough she is ready to find her forever home that will continue to help her heal physically and mentally in an environment fits her special needs. \n\nWhile Gypsy has been living with both big and small dogs, a cat, and she LOVES kids. (She's even been around chickens!) she would do best in home with no other animals or a single well adjusted dog her size that can teach her how to be a dog. \n\nDue to Gypsy\u2019s issues with men she would do best in home that does not include an adult male.  Gypsy\u2019s reactivity specifically escalates towards men with a darker complexion, facial hair, or large muscular body types.  \n\nGypsy needs a patient home, someone who understands she had a hard life and this is the result. Someone who will love her and continue taking her to training classes. She is amazingly smart and bonded so well to her foster mom and her children (yet even after 5 months has not became comfortable with the foster dad). We all know her potential, she just needs someone willing to continue building on the foundation her foster has laid down.\n\nNow for the wonderful side of Gypsy!\n\nShes funny!  She groans, and huffs when you annoy her. She loves hikes, swimming, going running. When she finds a dog she clicks with, she's very affectionate and playful. Shes needy. And always has to have a paw on or near her foster mom.  I can cradle her like a baby. My kids can lay on her. Shes SO good with puppies. She loves them and is incredibly gentle.\n\nPlease send a message to Paws Rescue if interested.",

Playboy was originally a stray on the island, was adopted from the Humane Society of St Thomas and then returned when his owner left island. Playboy was in a foster home on the island that had other pets.\nWhy was Playboy not adopted in St Thomas? Playboy is deaf, but knows some hand signals; he is also heartworm positive (he has started his treatment and full treatment is covered by Pet Search when adopted). We had him flown here to give him the chance for a great family... a chance he probably would not get on the island because of his age, his handicap and heartworm.\nYou will fall in love with this boy when you meet him... his forever home was not in paradise but we know it is somewhere in western PA.\nApplications are available at petsearchpa.org",

They were adopted by someone in Texas who hoped to train them as livestock guardians but the girls decided that they liked living indoors rather than outdoors. Sugar and Dusty made their way to New Jersey and were adopted, however Sugar never adjusted to \"city living\" she is a country girl through and through. Sugar is back in Texas and still looking for that perfect home. Her ideal home would be a farm environment without a lot of visitors. She is looking for a place where she can lounge outdoors during the day while keeping an eye on the property, then hang with her people indoors at night. Sugar is around 1.5 to 2 years old and weighs 75 pounds. She is crate trained and house trained. Sugar does well walking on a leash and does well in a vehicle. We would be willing to transport her to NJ, but it really has to be the perfect home for her. She cannot be in a home with children or even young adults. If you are a looking for a mellow independent dog please apply now and be sure to mention \"Sugar\".",

Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.

Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.

She's an 8 year old female lab/pit mix, and weighs about 80 pounds. She's very affectionate and loves to give doggie kisses. Red knows \"SIT, STAY, COME, and FETCH\" and she is calm and obedient in the absence of distractions. She is heartworm negative and has been spayed. Red would love to be an only pet, and she is very low maintenance. She does well with older children, but is a bit too clumsy for smaller kids that she may knock over. Her idea of fun is to go outside a couple of times a day to play fetch, or to take a moderate walk. Otherwise, she is happy to be a couch potato. Red prefers an area larger than a crate if she needs to be confined, such as a small room, where she will be calm and well-behaved. Red would love to meet you and become your very devoted life partner!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $125.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs.

He has limited vision due to cataracts and must have been so frightened.\n\nWe brought him to the vet where he was on fluids, intravenous antibiotics, and under treatment for a terrible mouth infection. His nails were overgrown and his coat was full of matting. He is now safe in our care and in a foster home.\n\nFluffernutter is an adorable 10 year old Poodle mix who loves giving and receiving kisses! A good belly rub is one of his favorite activities! He will do best as an only pup in his new home simply because he gets startled if other animals bump into him. He so deserves a wonderful home where he'll be treated like the little prince he truly is!\n\nThis sweet senior is heart worm negative, microchipped, up to date on his vaccines, neutered and takes daily medication for blood pressure regulation.\u00a0He gets sub-q fluids due to kidney disease issues. He recently had a dental during which a number of his teeth were removed. Please download our adoption application and email the completed form to adopt@bobbicares.org if you would like to meet this sweet boy. Kindly keep in mind that our adoptions are local only (Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan).",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

She just needs one to show her they mean well. \n\nShe would do best in an only dog home with older children. \n\nShe is the sweetest cuddle bug and will do anything for a treat!

She loves playing with other dogs and is good with older children.  This \u201cenergizer bunny\u201d is a big fan of a tennis ball. It\u2019s her favorite thing other than snuggling on the couch.  A family for Lucy should include a four legged friend who is young and can match her energy level.  If you\u2019re looking for a buddy to take walks or watch the sunrise, she will happily keep you company.\n\nPlacing Lucy in an adoptive home has been challenging because she has Addison\u2019s disease and will need to take medicine for the rest of her life that will cost between $120-$150 per month.   Therefore, she needs an owner who can provide for her medical needs without it being a hardship.  Please share so we can find this girl a special forever home.  Message us for more info.",

            "description": "1. PLEASE NOTE: Breed mix info is the best guess of Bark Bark Wag and our vets. There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test, so we have no way to know whether or not this dog is \"hypoallergenic\". Since he/she is a mixed breed, and could have as many as 4-5 breeds in his/her mix, it is safest to assume this dog is NOT hypoallergenic.\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\n10/20 UPDATE:  This adorable, squirmy cutie is Polly Noggin; a happy, feisty little girl who lets us know (loudly) when she's hungry or wants a snuggle!  She came to us in early August from Detroit Animal Care & Control with her Mom, Dad, and 3 siblings (all adopted). Polly has been a bit wobbly on her feet recently, and started having head tremors... After an ultrasound, Polly was just diagnosed with hydrocephalus (\"water on the brain\"). This neurological disorder happens when excess fluid leaks inside the skull, leading to pressure & brain swelling. It is generally a serious, often life-threatening condition which cannot be cured, only managed (if it's a milder case and/or caught early). Polly's prognosis depends on how severe her case is... We're hopeful she can be helped with medication, but expensive shunt surgery may be in her future (if she's even a candidate).  Polly has a neurological consult this month (October), but we won't know the extent of her issues/possible treatment options until we get the specialist's final report.  Bark Bark Wag is committed to giving Polly every possible chance at a normal life--this spunky girl is ready to fight, and we'll be with her every step of the way!\n\n(Polly is an adorable mix of Maltese, Brussels Griffon, Pug and fuzzy Terrier mix (best guess), and we think she will be 12-26# when full-grown. She is learning about toys, exploring the grassy outdoors, and starting to work on potty training.)\n\n11/1/20 UPDATE:  Polly Noggin had her neurology consult, along with an MRI, and sadly, the diagnosis was \"severe hydrocephalus\".  The specialist vet feels Polly is a candidate for expensive shunt surgery, and wants to recheck her progress in 2 months. This info is from the specialist's report:\n\"The degree of hydrocephalus is severe enough to warrant considering treatment with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. However, it would be ideal to have Polly Noggin's skull more mature prior to placement of the shunt.  Therefore, the plan is to continue to manage her with steroids and omeprazole for the next 2 months. If she declines in the interim we may need to consider performing surgery sooner.\"  Polly will remain in foster care indefinitely, and she is not available for adoption for the foreseeable future. We are still in need of donation assistance to help with Polly's upcoming surgery -- no amount is too small!  Please see below for details--thank you! \n\n12/11/20 UPDATE:\nPolly has been quietly growing up and getting stronger, and at 16 wks. old she's up to 7#! ? We are soooo fortunate that Polly's wonderful foster mom is also her vet. She and her loving human/fur family, as well as the awesome Healthy Paws vet clinic family, are providing Polly with lots of TLC, good nutrition & ongoing care, and she's thriving! Her hydrocephalus is currently well-managed on two medications, which are keeping the brain swelling at bay and allowing her skull to strengthen. Since Polly is stable and her symptoms are minimal at this time, our vet is hoping it may be possible to delay her needed surgery a bit longer, to give her body more time to grow/mature... This will give Polly the best chance of survival, since the surgery is very invasive and the younger/smaller the dog, the higher the risk. We'll learn more once our vet connects again with the neurologist at awesome Dogwood Vet Hospital soon with an update on Polly's progress, and we'll keep everyone posted!  In the meantime, Polly is doing allllll the puppy things... snuggling, playing, napping & even making a little mischief with her doggie/kitty friends!  \n\n1/10/21 UPDATE:  Little Polly is up to 9 lbs. and stable!  One of her medications has been discontinued, since she's doing so well... We are giving her all the love she can handle, watching her grow, and awaiting her surgery date once she's a little bigger/stronger!  Bark Bark Wag deeply appreciates everyone's love and generous donations toward this little fighter's care so far!  \n\nTO MAKE A DONATION:  Won't you please help Polly? It takes a community to make a difference; donations in any amount can help save her life! Donations can be made here on FB; at barkbarkwag.org, click on \"contact/donate\"; or to the vet clinic directly (pls. email us for info). Some dogs go on to live pretty normal lives with the families who love them, and that is Bark Bark Wag's hope for Polly... please help us give her that chance!\n\n",

JJ loves getting pets, sitting in your lap and sleeping at your feet.\u00a0 His forever owner will need to have him checked every 6 months to make sure his dosage of medicine is correct and know that he will be on his medication for the rest of his life.\n\nIf you want a buddy to walk with and someone who loves having his ears scratched, JJ is your man.\n\nJJ\u2019s adoption fee is $250 and he is worth every penny of that because of sweet companionship he provides.\n\nIf you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application.\u00a0 The link for the application is below.\u00a0\n\nTo submit an application go here\u2026\u2026chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\u00a0\n\nAn application must be submitted and approved before a meet-n-greet can be scheduled.\u00a0\n\nYour current dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered unless a veterinarian has determined that your current pet(s) should not be fixed due to medical reasons.\u00a0 They must also be up-to-date on shots and on HW preventative.\u00a0\n\nReference checks and a home visit are required so SE dogs can only be adopted in NC/SC, VA MD and GA.",

            "description": "Bruno is a sweet older boy who LOVES to role in the grass!  In fact, he loves it so much that he will stop the role and lay with his legs in the air!  Bruno has some mild arthritis but has been doing well on Daququin and Carprofen as needed on colder days. Bruno loves the ladies (female dogs) - does not like his foster mom's male dog- but seemed okay with other male dogs in the past.  Cats are an unknown.  Bruno enjoys playing with his toys and occasionally will hide them!  Older children should be fine for Bruno.  We would love to see Bruno with a retired person or couple who enjoy leisurely strolls.  He does not get on the furniture but does appreciate his dog bed. Bruno knows basic commands and walks like a gentleman on a leash.   Neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations.  Heart-worm negative.  Crate trained.  Bruno is approx 8-9 years old and weighs about 98#.\nADOPTION DETAILS: All RHR available dogs live in foster homes. Each dog is spayed, neutered, (unless medically on hold) up to date on shots, dewormed, and microchipped. At this time, due to the size of our rescue, adoptions are limited to NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA and +/-6 hours from Raleigh, NC. ADOPTION FEE: Our total adoption fee is $250, including a non-refundable $25 application fee. Fee can be paid using the \"DONATE\" button on our website (www.RottweilerHeartsRescue.org) - please indicate in the notes that it is for an application fee, and the intended dog. If you have any questions, please email our adoption coordinator at RHR.Adoption@gmail.com!",

She tends to bark at and chase the stray cats that visit her yard, but does so/so with the indoor cat.  She hasnt tried to hurt him, but she does annoy and chase him at times.  She knows how to use a doggie door and is crate trained perfectly.   She can be bossy with the other Border Collie she is living with. \n\nHarlee is not a \"hyper\" dog as some tend to think regarding Border Collies.  She is a low key girl who enjoys cuddling up with her people.   She is not the type of dog you can trust off leash, so she would not be a good competition Border Collie.   We would be afraid she would run.    She does listen very well when in the home, but outside where she has free run (in a fenced in acre) she sometimes takes a minute to come back inside.    \n\nShe is being spayed, microchipped and vaccinated prior to her adoption.

Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com.

            "description": "Penelope is an experienced (if unsuccessful) squirrel hunter. She will keep those little guys in line - and in the trees.  She loves a good romp in the yard and naps in the sun. \n\nCuddles on the couch are equally important. She's a great companion a NetFlix binge or an HGTV marathon.  Penelope also enjoys chewing on bones, snoozing under the desk and generally hanging with her human.\n\nPenelope has lovely house manners and is an easy dog to have around. She's playful, silly and full of joy.  Her birthday is in November of 2012, so she's a lovely calm lady, but still lively and loving.\n\nPenelope is heartworm negative, spayed, up-to-date on her vaccinations and ready for her forever family.\n\nPenelope's approx. DOB is 11/1/2012.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted via the online form http://pupsquad.org/adopt/adoption-application.html.\n\nDuring COVID 19 - We may not be able to help coordinate transport out of state due to limited resources on our end and limited transport options to get the dogs to destinations outside of Texas.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

This happy and always smiling dog is just 4 years old and looks to be mostly a Lab mix that now weighs a healthy 65 lbs. She is a very playful girl that delights in your attention and the company of humans and toys.lots of toys that she can play with. Walking Angel Sue does require a harness only due to the old injury on her neck. We are requiring a fenced yard so she has the freedom to exercise and stretch her energetic legs.

He was most likely dumped at shelter because he has rheumatoid arthritis. He would of most likely been euthanized if we had not have saved him. \n\nWith regards to his arthritis, he is not a candidate for surgery and requires medical management, which consists of inexpensive pain medication, a healthy diet, and joint supplements. His arthritis does not slow him down. When he gets tired, we recommend either a dog carrier or stroller so that he does not miss out. He loves the Hussle and bustle of life and does not like to miss out on a thing. \n\nRoo is extremely sweet, loving, and gentle.\n\n Loves other dogs and loves people. Very laid back and well behaved. \n\nLoves to follow you around the house and snuggle. Loves to always be right next to you, he does have a little bit of separation anxiety but nothing major. Once settled into a routine he will most likely settle down. \n\nHe is potty trained but on occasion he will mark, he responds to corrective behavior once he\u2019s neutered the marking in the house should stop (we pay for the neuter)\n\nHe Loves to go places and run errands with you. Would be good in a home where he gets a lot of attention and people are always around. Would also be very good in a family home with kids (kids that well behaved with dogs) and he would probably prefer to be in a home with other dogs, but would still be fine without other dogs as long as people are always around.\n\nHe is not a candidate to be left alone for long periods of time unless he has a buddy.\n\n\nApply to adopt at: https://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/adoptionandfosterapplication\n\nApply to foster at: \n\nWe are by appointment only. You must submit and have an approved application before meeting AHWF animals.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

She has no leash training, so we will work on that.  No experience with cats or kids.  No small children as she will be a good sized dog.\nShe is a RESCUE and will be spayed, chipped wormed & UTD on shots.\nNo other history available.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Keira or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.American Bulldog/Pit Bull Mix | 3 years old | 75 pounds | Adoption Fee $225\n\nChamp is a handsome 75-pound Doberman Pinscher/ Staffordshire Terrier and sweet Ladies Man looking for a gal to call his own.\n\nChamp ensures he stays in shape on the regular. His long legs make him a solid runner, who enjoys trail runs, especially bounding through the winter snow. Other times, he shows off by playing fetch by himself (throwing the toy then retrieving it). He is even a great muscle building partner, engaging his gal in a flirtatious game of tug of war.\n\nAfter a suitable exercise session, Champ will engage in good dental hygiene by enjoying a chew toy by the fire or a well-deserved Kong cocktail of peanut butter and milkbone. He takes some time to approach new people on his own terms, but once comfortable is very loving. Champ adores bedtime snuggles with his lady (he enjoys being the big spoon) to warm the other side of the bed.\n\nChamp would do best in a home without shared walls (such as an apartment or townhome), as he takes it upon himself to be your protector, and will bark at passers by. Champ has no problem with other dogs, but swipes left on cats or other small creatures. He has not yet been around young children, but due to his size, he may knock over small children in his playful exuberance, so older children (middle school or above) would be a better fit.\n\nIn terms of adults, Champ will need to be surrounded solely by adult women, in a home with limited interaction from men. He doesn't like the competition for affection, and likely came from a situation of prior abuse by a male. This boy would also benefit from a home with previous bully-breed experience, and confident, strong guiding leadership.\n\nNot only is Champ tall, muscular and handsome, but also is no slouch when it comes to smarts. Champ has learned \"sit\", \"shake\" and \"drop\" during his time in foster care, and would love to learn more from his special lady. Champ also has impeccable manners that you'd be glad to take out on the town, his leash in your arm.\n\nChamp is a sweet and playful gentleman looking for the perfect lady to be his exercise partner, snuggle bug, and evening date. If you are the one to fit the bill, send an application to his foster, and they will set up a first date.\n\nThe most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you. 2/2/21 5:51 PM",

He them came to us where he was put on bed rest for months so he could heal. This meant he missed out on crucial socialization skills puppies gain during the first few months of their life, he started showing signs of fearful insecure behavior. \n\nJust recently Barney has been through extensive training and is growing into  confident, calm dog. He loves nothing more than to play with his dog friends in the yard. \n\nWhat we have learned about Barney is that he is  looking for a strong confident leader in his life. If Barney does not have structure and discipline and leadership he thinks that it is his job to guard and protect. It will be his new owners job to make sure that Barney knows this is not his role and to correct his behaviour. \n\nBarney is extremely intelligent and knows that his cuteness will get him out of doing training exercises and has proven stubborn. However he will do just about anything for a piece of chicken.  As he cannot go on long walks he will need a lot of mental stimulation which will include fun nose/sniffing activities to wear him out.\n\nWhat we have also learned since Barney's training is that he is extremely sensitive to change and moving him into a new home straight away causes him great anxieties which causes him to bark out of fear and uncertainity. \n\n\n We are looking for from his new potential adopter is to come and meet Barney and build a relationship with him before moving him into his new home. We will look to set up several meet and greets at his trainer\u2019s facility, then a couple of day dates and visits to your home and once we feel like he is ready we can move him in officially.\n\nAs mentioned he loves other dogs\nWill do best in a home with or without another dog\nPotty trained\nBarney is a couch potato - great apartment dog- He tires easily which means he can only go on short walks anywhere between 10-20minutes, he lets you know when he is tired and will lie down.\nVery independent- enjoys his alone time\nCrate trained- Loves his crate\nWalks great on a leash- trained with a prong collar- \nSuper sweet, gentle, cuddle bug, \nsoft and gentle\nLoves to snuggle on the couch and nipple your nails and nose to show his love. \nHe loves to sniff everything\nLoves to meet to new people and dogs\nBarney knows basic commands- Sit, Down, Leave It, Place\n\n\nBarney is looking for an experienced owner who can continue and maintain all his training. \n\n\nBarney is a healthy pup. \nWith regards to his leg, there are no long-term issues, it is however important to maintain a healthy weight. We highly recommend looking into joint and bone supplements and a healthy diet to keep his bones healthy and strong.\n\n\nApply to foster at:\nhttps://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/fosterprocessandapplication\n\nApply to adopt at: https://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/adoptionandfosterapplication\n\nWe are by appointment only.

He's a 3 year old, terrier mix. \nNerf is a bundle of energy that oozes into a snuggle buddy at the end of the day. \nFetch is his game of choice. Nerf can play and play and play. While his bark sounds a bit scary, he's just very enthusiastic. We've been using two balls to keep him occupied and he is learning to drop' quite nicely. \nNerf runs well with other dogs outside, but may be best as an only dog. \nNerf deserves a home with fenced yard so he can run freely and a family with older kids who can play with him and help teach him basic commands.",

After being with an incredibly patient and loving foster family who worked hard to bring her around, Joy is now ready to find the perfect forever family.\n\nJoy is still very shy when first meeting new people, but after a bit of time you will see her amazing ability to trust come shining through. Joy enjoys running and will alternate between leaping around like a gazelle and running with her butt tucked under for maximum speed! She gets along great with other dogs and kitties and seems to bond with them quickly. Joy needs a playmate who is equally energetic and loves to play. She is very smart and *mostly* understands that inside is cuddle, nap, or quiet play time and outside is run around with the zoomies time! She also LOVES, LOVES, LOVES soft toys and will gather them all in her crate or in a corner for safe keeping...soft toys seem to be a comfort for her.\n\nJoy is mostly crate trained and housebroken and does her best when on a scheduled potty routine to prevent any accidents. Joy responds well to positive reinforcement and blossoms quickly in new environments with those methods. We don't recommend she go to a home with small children (because they can be scary) but we believe she will do great with older, considerate kids/teens.\n\nJoy is a 2-3 year old 50 pound Shep mix. She is up to date on vaccinations, dewormed, spayed, microchipped and on monthly heartworm prevention.\n\nIf you're interested in giving this special girl a loving home, please complete our application below and one of our volunteers will be in touch!\n\ntinyurl.com/thirdcoastapplication\n\nThe day Joy was rescued...so you can see just how far she has come.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thirdcoastanimalrescue/videos/2319938618092015/\n\nMobile, Alabama",

            "description": "Meet Hazel. She\u2019s a 7 year old, 70 lb lap dog.  She is finicky about other dogs. Some dogs she loves, but other dogs no. So she would be best as an only dog. We first came across Hazel when she was set to be euthanized at the shelter in 2016. We got her out and found her a wonderful home and she was the perfect babysitter for the children. Fast forward to September 2020. Her owners returned her because she got into a fight with one of their dogs. So now Hazel is in a foster home and longs for her own home. She would be a perfect companion for an elderly person, couple or a family, as she is very calm, friendly, loyal and affectionate. Also, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Hazel and would like to meet her, please text us at 713-562-5059. Thank you",

However, he does need to be placed in a home where he can be an only dog.\n\n*This dog is a graduate of the prison program. Prison program dogs spend a minimum of 6 weeks at the Saginaw correctional facility,  living with specially-selected inmates who have trained to work with the dogs. They learn basic commands, housebreaking, crate training, and leash walking*\n\nFor more information or to request an adoption application, please stop into the shelter, or contact us via email.\n\nbollmanje@baycounty.net\n(989) 894-0679",

            "description": "Due to the current situation with the COVID-19 (Corona) virus, in-person home visits are not possible at this time. Since this is a very important part of finding the best home for our dogs, we are not accepting any applications from first-time pet owners, applicants who have not had a pet in the past 3 years, or applicants who cannot furnish vet records.  We hope you understand and that you will consider applying to adopt once restrictions have been lifted.\n\nHello, my name is Faith Hill.  I\u2019m a very cute 10 year old, chocolate & white Cocker Spaniel.  \n\nI love to be on the couch next to you but don\u2019t walk away and leave me on any furniture because I may fall off.  I LOVE belly rubs and brushing.   I MUST be supervised around pools.   I don\u2019t like baths, but that\u2019s because I had a bad experience in the water.   I walk very slowly on a leash because I\u2019m cautious.  I\u2019m a GREAT car rider!  \n\nI may whine when I think I might be alone but I\u2019ve never barked.  I would do best with a family where someone is home a lot.  I will require eye drops and allergy meds for the remainder of my life to keep my eyes healthy and control my allergies.\n\nI LOVE ice in my water!  You may find a puddle here and there.  I\u2019m sorry.  I drink a lot of water, so I need to go potty a lot and I have no idea where the door is.  Plus, I\u2019ve been outside most of my life and never really been properly potty trained, but I always go potty when I\u2019m taken outside.  I may squat, walk and poop l at the same time so there\u2019s always a trail.  \n\nI\u2019m OK with other dogs or cats.  I don\u2019t mind young children but I may feel better in a home without loud sudden noises and toys to run into.  Because my vision is impaired, please don\u2019t rearrange the furniture or forget to push in your dining room/desk chair.  I sleep in the kitchen at night for my own safety.  I LOVE a fluffy dog bed but will lay on tile or laminate if I\u2019m hot.  I can be left to wander in the house while you\u2019re away, I\u2019m not a troublemaker.  \n\nFaith is such a sweet girl and makes an excellent companion and lap dog, which is all she wants in life.\n\nIf you would like to meet Faith Hill, please complete our adoption application and put her name at the top.  http://dfwcockerrescue.org/ under Adoptions, Adoption Information.\n\n<BR><BR>\n<b>For more pictures and information about this and all the cockers available at DFW Cocker Spaniel Rescue please visit our website at www.dfwcockerrescue.org</b>\n",

He loves sleeping in his bed with his favorite blanket and loves going on his daily walks. Hes great with other dogs and wants to be buddies with all of them. Id say he would do well in a home with a backyard he can go play around in because he loves the patches of grass. But he is enjoying the city life too ! \n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

He loves long walks and being with his people.\n\nDumas has a typical Coonhound voice, so would probably do best in a house where the noise won't be an issue for the neighbors! He loves to wrestle and play with other dogs, especially puppies, but he sometimes does not like to share so feeding should be supervised. He does not like a plastic crate, but will go into a wired one easily. He takes a few minutes to settle down, particularly if he can still see people, but he quiets and does not have accidents inside it. He is doing well with house training but may still have the odd accident.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application.",

            "description": "Bruce!  Where do we begin?  Bruce was found slipping in and out of consciousness in 115 degree heat.  He had a gash that needed immediate care on the top of his head, his ears were blooded and ripped apart, his nose was raw with open wounds and his body had signs of horror throughout.  When Bruce was rushed to the Humane Society, his savior was told he would be put to sleep if they did not commit to taking him.  At that time, Poverty's Pets heard about Bruce's dire situation and we committed to his medical care and his recovery.  Obviously we had no idea how Bruce was towards humans and other animals but over time, as he slowly began to trust the kind hands and as his body healed, his beautiful, loving soul emerged. Bruce is a survivor and a lover.  We have been so moved by his recovery and to see him feel happiness and joy.  Bruce does tolerate other dogs but he is most happy being an only animal.  He just craves human contact and does get upset having to share his people with other pets.  Bruce needs a simple life.  You see, x-rays confirmed his constant limp when he walks as severe\narthritis and elbow dysplasia. His walks need not be long but they are good for him.  He will do best surrounded by tennis balls, a big cushy bed and people.  Bruce is about 6 years old, is wonderful on walks, loves car rides and is the best couch potato in town.   Bruce will make a wonderful companion and if you feel as though you can provide him a wonderful life, please take a moment to fill out an application:  https://www.povertyspets.org/adoption-form.  There is a $200 donation.  Please allow up to 72 hours for response.  Thank you for considering Bruce.\n",

            "description": "Bo is a distinguished senior Chihuahua/Terrier mix who is about 14 years old and weighs 14 lbs. Bo came up on a transport from North Carolina in mid-August with his two siblings after his prior owner passed away. Being a senior with skinny little terrier legs, Bo is having some difficulty with balance and mobility likely due to arthritis. He has been started on a daily supplement which may help to improve his abilities. He currently has some difficulty navigating stairs unassisted, so he would do best in a home with few stairs as he will likely need to be carried up and down. Bo does require a companion animal (preferably a dog) in the home.\n\nHe is in a foster home with other dogs and has no trouble holding his own although he might do best in a home with small to medium-sized dogs or other seniors. He has shown some food aggression, so it would be best to feed him separately to avoid snarling and cussing.\n\nHe likes everyone he meets and lives with an 11-year-old girl in his foster home, but is untested around younger children. Bo tends to fall asleep and snore on any available lap. He eats and drinks well and is very regular for an old man! He does seem to have some environmental allergies so he has been getting daily eye drops to help.\n\nBo's adoption fee is $150 (senior dog rate) which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.\n\nIf you would like to meet Bo, please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application",

Todd was found as a stray, he was positive for heartworm & Lyme he has been treated for both and is awaiting his appointment to be neutered.. Todd is very much all puppy even tho he\u2019s about 2 years old.. He loves to play he thinks anything can be a toy, he would be happy to play with a water bottle all day if that\u2019s all he had.. He is a sweet boy, he does well with other dogs. He is very playful so he would need someone to match his energy level.. No cats, no small children..\n\nPlease fill out an application and review our adoption procedures on our website at www.wwk9rescue.com Todd is currently being fostered in a private foster home in Colebrook, CT. Please note that all dogs in rescue are in private foster homes and meet and greets are by appointment only with approved applicants. Todd\u2019s adoption fee is $350",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Michelle at mhunt@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Shelby\nEstimated Breed : Husky Mix\nApproximate Age: 2 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 45 lbs\nCurrently Living at: foster\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nShelby is crate trained, happy, playful, energetic and affectionate, what more can you ask for...\nOH! and let's not forget her beautiful eyes!! She loves her people and can get excited when she plays so probably won't do well with young/small children.\nAre you a runner/jogger?.... Shelby loves to run with her foster mom & dad and is the best running partner around town! Shelby runs several few miles a day and would make any runner proud!\nSo if you are have an active lifestyle and are looking for an amazing pup... Shelby just might be the one!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Hi there my name is Hugo and I\u2019m a very LARGE and handsome 8 year old boy looking for a new forever home. \n\nI love meeting new people and going new places, in fact I got to ride on 4 different small airplanes to get from CO to Gladwin MI! What an adventure that was. Everyone I meet falls in love with my handsome face and friendly personality.  Here's a little more bio info from my foster human:\n\n -I don\u2019t play well with other animals, so I should be an only pet\n- I\u2019m a HUGE lover and love my people \n- once I attach myself to someone I\u2019m theirs for life\n- I live for walks, I get super excited for them! I would be an EXCELLENT hiking buddy\n- I love all people and would do best with kids that are around 6 years old and older \n- I do snip at faces at times not to hurt people however. I nibble on people\u2019s chins sometimes. That seems to be a sign on dominance. This goes away once pack order is established. I\u2019ve NEVER done this to a child that we know of. Seems to be geared towards adults. \n- needs EXERCISE!!! I\u2019m not a couch potato! I\u2019m a working dog! I need a job to do even a few good long walks at the exact same time every day with a backpack is a GREAT job for me! Otherwise I will act out! I\u2019m a malamute after all that\u2019s common! \n- loves car rides\n- does excellent at the vet\n- house trained\n- neutered, chipped updated on vaccines and heartworm negative \n- can be demanding \n- highly food motivated!!!\n- can be playful but not overly \n- non aggressive with food and toys\n- walks well on the leash with minor pulling \n-MUST have a tall,  secured fenced in yard \n\nIf you would like to know even MORE about me you can email Dogrescue0146@gmail.com \nOr you may go ahead and fill out the MEET AND GREET APPLICATION at www.fewstepsfromhome.com \n-- \n\nNote from the humans: Hugo is being fostered at Few Steps from Home Animal Rescue. If you are interested in Hugo please visit their website at\n http://www.fewstepsfromhome.com/ or email them at dogrescue0146@gmail.com. They will be handling the adoption of Hugo.",

Here is the write up. Please message us if interested and we will put you in touch!\nIt is with great sadness that I am looking to rehome Remy. He hasn\u2019t been the easiest dog, but he is a great dog with a lot of character and love to give. He's always been afraid of new people, but at a year and a half old he became aggressive and would want to bite. I sent him to a 2 month board and train (not at Liberty K9). He\u2019s really obedient now, but unfortunately they did not address his behavior problems. About a year ago he developed dog aggression when he used to be fine with dogs. Despite this, I have still tried to give him the best life I possibly could and we have had many fun adventures together. Remy loves hiking (especially in winter), running with the wheeler, water, and really anything outside. He is a very high energy dog that needs a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. \nRemy needs somebody who is experienced with dogs that have behavior problems and someone who is willing to give him the \u201cextra\u201d that needs. He will need to go to a home without kids and could possibly fit in a home that already has a dog, but that would need to be evaluated. \n-He will be 4 on October 10th. \n-He is a husky/shepherd mix (LK9 swears he has some Great Pyrenees in there). \n-He is 75 pounds of fluff. \n-He is off leash trained and knows the commands sit, down, stay, come, leave it, drop it, and shake. \n-I will ensure he is up to date on his shots.\n******************************************",

I have a beautiful coat that is soft to the touch. All the little Che Guevara's go for me!!! The only one that I want to go for me is one that will give me a warm and loving home. Couldn't you come down to the shelter and pick me out so we can start a love fest together?\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:Baby girl is a lover. She has been brought up well and will be the perfect house pooch for you. She is a little scared about being in the shelter but will do fine in a loving home environment. She gets along with other dogs too! She is around 2 years old and 37 pounds of companionship!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

Like most dobies he loves his people and wants to be with them all the time.  A long walk will be a great way to start the day with this dobie boy.\n\nThor is crate trained and it's a good tool for him since he can get bored and get into stuff he shouldn't.\nThor's favorite game is fetch, will play for hours if you are up for it.  \n\nObedience training is a must for Thor.  He knows a few commands, especially if you have a yummy treat for incentive. Thor really wants to please his people.\n\nThor lives around kitties that are very dog savvy so they do not give him a reason to chase.  A younger cat that isn't so used to dogs may prove to be a fun game for Thor.\n\nThor loves people so much he would prefer to be an only dog or to live with a female that isn't going to pay him much attention.  No home with a male dog or a dominant female will be considered for adoption of Thor.\n\n\nAll of our dogs are in foster homes and are available to meet by appointment only and only after an application has been completed.  To complete an application, please visit our website at www.bluegrassdobermanrescue.org",

            "description": "How we just love this shy boy! Buster is a couple years old, about 14 lbs  and came out of a hoarding situation. He was passed over by several rescues because he seemed aggressive. This little guy cuddles against the back of my legs every night as close as he can to me. He is always up for snuggling close in the covers. He LOVES other dogs and definitely needs to be in the company of at least one other FRIENDLY CONFIDENT dog. My friendly pack has taught him a lot and he is modeling their friendly behavior. I have two children and while he doesn\u2019t seek their attention, he is getting better about receiving it when they reach to pet him. He follows them and is curious. He has the absolute CUTEST RUN and he flies down my stairs so fast he almost tumbles. He\u2019s quite the quirky little dude. He is still very shy when you just reach for him but he will run up to me and jump on my legs for lots of pets. I still don\u2019t just reach to pick him up as he is too\nInsecure still. All of us have gotten attached to Buster or Butters as we affectionately call him. This little boy will blossom with more time and attention. He is getting really reliable about using the doggie door and pottying in our fenced yard. 400\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

She already knows basic obedience and is just a gem of a dog.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Zoe was found as a stray in Missouri and put into a city pound. There was no shelter in that area to take Zoe in, so when her time was up in the pound she was transferred to Safe Haven. While the vet in Missouri had guessed Zoe to be a Great Pyrenees - commonly used as a 'Livestock Guardian Dog' or LGD. Once Zoe was at Safe Haven, it was actually discovered that her unique appearance (docked ears and tail) is exactly what a rare breed of LGD dog known as 'Central Asian Shepherd Dog' or 'CASD' looks like. Zoe looks and acts identical to this breed standard pictures and descriptions. Central Asian Shepherds are a pretty rare type of Livestock Guardian Dog here in the United States yet - and was not even a choice on our website as a breed, so she was listed just as a Pyrenees and Shepherd. The Central Asian Shepherd was first developed in Russia several thousands of years ago. This breed is commonly bred to be a Livestock Guardian Dog, similiar to the Great Pyrenees, and would guard the livestock flocks from large predators, such as bears and wolves. The Central Asian Shepherd Dogs have their ears and tails docked when young, because they often fight off wolves while protecting their livestock - so having their ears and tails docked, protect these dogs from having a predator attack and bite their ears and tail. Central Asain Shepherd Dogs are known to be large, powerful, intense and fearless - and therefore are not suitable for first-time dog owners. They are an intelligent and independent breed, which can prove difficult to train. Possible owners should be experienced and firm, and Zoe's forever home should also be prepared for her to potentially be highly protective. Zoe will do best with a large fenced in yard so she can safely get exercise, or perhaps even a farm home where she may enjoy a chance at guarding livestock. The vet estimates Zoe to be 4 & 1/2 years old and she tips the scale at 106 pounds. We think she likely has some stories to tell as to how she became a stray, but all we know for sure is that she has some better days ahead! Zoe will need to be the only pet in her home as she has shown aggression towards other dogs she has met, and appears to have a pretty high prey drive. Zoe was briefly adopted by a loving couple, and she bonded very quickly with the male in the home. This bond did cause a problem as Zoe's protective tendencies came out toward his wife, including two minor bite incidents - and even though they both loved Zoe, they did decide it was best to return her to Safe Haven before anything serious happened. Since returning to Safe Haven we have noticed Zoe does not like to have humans down in her face or standing over her - she does seem to feel threatened in those situations - so any possible adopter must be aware and understand how important it is to avoid placing Zoe in these situations. This big girl is a very unique rescue dog, that we hope can find a home suited to keep her safe and happy - and a home that has experience with Livestock Guardian Dogs would likely be best suited for Zoe.

We need your help to find them! \n\u2022\nAdoptable Jessie has now been in foster with us for 974 days. 2 years and 8 months ago she came to us as a stray from Chester. Jessie or Jessica Marie (her legal name) is a 5-6 year old pitbull/boxer mix. She is spayed, utd on everything, house trained, crate trained, and great on a leash. She\u2019s a bit picky of the people she wants to be around. She either wants you to be her best friend or wants nothing to do with you. The perfect home for Jessie is as follows: nice people, a fenced in backyard where she can run and play, no kids because she likes to run around and could knock one over, only older calm male dogs, and no cats. We know the perfect home is out there for Jessie and we really need your help finding her one! She is a queen and deserves to be the center of attention at her own home. Reach out to your friends who may be looking for a new dog! She might be perfect! Share her please! \nIf you live within a two hour drive of Coatesville and you want to meet Jessie please go to https://www.luckydawganimalrescue.com/application-process to fill out an application!",

And I guarantee we will have a blast and, yes, live happily ever after!?\n\nAvailable for adoption at:\nMuskingum County Dog Warden & Adoption Center\n1500 Newark Rd., Zanesville, Ohio 43701\n740-453-0273\nPlease call ahead if you plan to visit.\nOpen M-F 11-5 and Saturday 11-4.\n\nAdoption fee is $105 which includes spay/neuter, combo, rabies, and bordetella vaccines, heartworm test and dog license, $125 if vaccinated for the flu.

            "description": "Layla was an owner surrender. Her former owner said she kept jumping their fence and running away. (we have not seen anything resembling that behavior since she got to her foster home)\n\nLayla's paperwork is confusing. She is listed as 6 years on some of the paperwork, and 8 on others. Her energy level/teeth/eyes indicate closer to 6 years old.\n\nLayla was treated for intestinal worms and heartworms since she came in to our rescue. She is done with the treatments, and appears healthy and happy!\n\nLayla  plays with the dogs here, and she has done fine with the ones who don't want to play. Her former owner indicated she has some resource issues, with her food, and she is fed separately from the other dogs. Layla talks a lot===and much of that sounds like growling/grumbling.\n\nThis little one is not a snuggler (so far!). Her new owners will have to simply give her the space and time to settle and unwind---a week or two. She is obviously confused about her world being turned upside down, and is taking her time to settle and warm up to people. \nShe will bring a toy over to play, and bark to go out.  She loves playing with balls, although simply runs around with them and never returns them.\n\nLayla sits and is learning to walk on a leash. When everyone is called in from the yard, she is the first one in to get her treat! Layla is very responsive to positive training and treats and rewards.\n\nShe seems housebroken.  She barks at the door when she wants to go out.\n\nLayla asks for very little. She is content to sleep in a corner or a spot with sunlight. She waits patiently for her breakfast and dinner. She did well when given a bath, and seems to enjoy being brushed.\n\nLayla has not been tested with cats or children.\n\nLayla is in Sparta NJ. We ask that people complete an application prior to meeting her. A home check/visit is also necessary.  Her adoption fee is $300.   Thank you for looking at rescued dogs!",

He had no training prior to joining the rescue, and has a tendency to act like an excitable puppy in a bigger body, but he is also very trainable and loves people! He would do best as either the only dog in the home, or with a playful, friendly female canine companion.\n\nDude will thrive in an active home that will provide him with both mental and physical stimulation (think runs, play time, practice training/good manners and puzzle games to tire out his big brain).\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Dude, please complete an application at www.sacrdr.org/adopt.\nTo keep up with Dude, check out #SacRDRDude on Facebook and Instagram!",

            "description": "Coral was one in litter of 5. Mom was a small wire haired terrier looking Gal and Dad is believed to have some min pin or chi. Whatever they are, they were all just beyond darling with adorable personalities. Her cute little underbite goes famously with her cute little sass. Microchipped, spayed and up to date on vaccines, Coral is spunky, playful, and affectionate. She has done so well in foster care and is an absolute gem, but she is going to need a patient person(s) to help her transition. Coral can be a \"runner\" when she is scared an unfamiliar. It took about 2 weeks in her foster home for her to understand she was safe but until then she bolted out of her crate and would bolt out of a door if given the opportunity. So she needs someone who will understand her, help her feel comfortable and be very cautious until she settles in to her new home. She definitely needs a fenced yard to run, she has the longest legs and loves to do her zoomies to get her energy out. Because she can be jumpy when she gets excited, we recommend no small children. We would require more than one meet and greet so that Coral gets a feel for her new people prior to adoption and are looking for a local adopter so that we can help Coral transition.\n\nInterested in adopting me?

I only weighed 38.5 lbs when they saved me. Whew! I was almost a goner! \nThey contacted a nice rescue where I got to go and be in a great foster home. There I got to meet a lot of dogs and was nice to them except when it was time to eat. I am learning how to share too. Who knew if you were a good boy that you got to get on the couch and roam around the house and play with the other dogs. I didn\u2019t even know it was ok to go in the house until I got there. \nOh the FOOD! I am learning that I get plenty to eat even though I still don\u2019t want to share. \n\nMy foster mom says I will get a new home once I get neutered and get my heart worms treated, whatever that means. So I\u2019ll be here just hanging with them for awhile. If you want me to be your guy then just hit me up \u2013 I\u2019m Rocky!!\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL.   You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application.  www.rockinprescue.org\n\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

Please help Gracie find a home that deserves her sweetness. Gracie is a sweet girl, found as a stray in North Augusta, running with another dog. Turned out to have an owner who didn't want them back. Her friend has been adopted, but Gracie still needs a home. She got on well with her doggie friend and is very gentle with humans.\n\nAdoption fee is $150 (which includes all vetting plus 1 month heartworm prevention and flea tick prevention, martingale collar, and a bag of the food she is currently on) and she is available for adoption via Shelter Animals Advocates. www.shelteranimalsadvocates.org",

Her favorite shelter activity was scaling the chain link fences so good, non-chain link fencing is a must.\n\nSkylar needs slow introductions to new dog friends but once that's done she loves to play. I'm told she likes to be the boss in play groups so if you love dog parks, Skylar may not be your dog.\n\nSkylar is not \"a starter Husky\" and would definitely benefit from living in an experienced foster home. She was very stressed at the shelter (who wouldn't be!) so we're looking forward to seeing how she blossoms now that she's out.\n\nSkylar needs to be spayed and vetted as soon as we can get an appointment so she will be available soon!",

She's great on a leash, knows how to sit, shake, wait, and is house broken.  She is great with the people she's met, including kids, and loves to snuggle.  Ryder is only ~40 lbs so a compact little snuggle bug. \n\nRyder would do best in a home with no other dogs.  She hasn't been tested with cats or other animals. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Ryder, contact her owner at hejala@gmail.com.\n\n",

Copper is an active boy and will need an active family to match him! He would make a great jogging or hiking partner.

However, we do know he is a very smart and playful boy. Maxie would greatly benefit from an active family that can give him a lot of structure. He is very toy and treat motivated and would likely pick up commands fast! Due to his size and energy level, we'd recommend a home with older dog savvy children. Maxie previously had a kennel mate but had to be separated from him as kennel frustration caused him to act out towards him. He would likely be best as an only dog or with a submissive female after a slow introduction. Maxie would not do well with kitties or any other small animals. He will need a 6ft privacy fence and a secure yard.\n\nHe is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on heartworm and flea preventative. Stop by and meet him, 9-1, Mon thru Sat!",

He's done well with every dog we've introduced him to and really just wants to play and explore. He has some separation anxiety right now which he expresses by barking - a lot - so he will need a home where he's not alone often and that is willing to help him gain confidence and trust. This guy cannot be a city dog - he is far to noisy. He needs a safe, country home.\n\nHank has some issues with resource guarding and is still quite mouthy, so he needs a home with no children. He would appreciate a young doggy companion or two, but no cats or other small animals. He will need plenty of exercise and training, and will bond strongly with his family. Can you give this boy his forever home?\n\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $350  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

I walk well on a leash and love to explore my surroundings. I am\na total ball dog. Who can turn down a good game of fetch?!  My foster mom says I am super sweet.  I am crate trained and house trained. I get along with other dog but only if you properly introduce me to them plus I need to be reminded constantly that I need to mind my manners when meeting new dogs because my excitement makes them nervous and I can get in trouble but I really mean well. Also, you must know, I have never been cat tested. I get pretty excited on walks when I see cats and squirrels so my people are going to say no to a home with a furry feline. They think I might want to give chase and they are probably correct.  \n\nI am spayed, health certified, up to date on vaccines and microchipped.",

She was a great mama to them and is now ready for someone to take care of her.\n\nShe loves to play, is great with other dogs, and is a great snuggle buddy at bedtime.\n\nListed breed is an educated guess made by our veterinarian and is NOT a guarantee - this also means we have no way of knowing what a puppy's adult size will be.\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered in Mississippi and will be transported via Barton's Barkers transport services upon adoption. Their adoption fee is $450 and includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, a nose to tail vet check, microchip and transport costs. Second Chances lists dogs as being available in White River Junction, VT because we transport our dogs to the area every 3rd week after they have been adopted. All of our local shelters have a high euthanasia rate due to overpopulation so we created our rescue group to primarily adopt to the northern states to help keep as many dogs as we can from entering our kill shelters.",

I would like to place these girls together into a home that will appreciate their high energy play style.**** How to describe this puppy named Nina? Well, a little bit of this and a little bit of that! She is part doxie, part yorkie, part chihuahua and all energetic playfulness. She was given up because her owner could no longer care for her. It's taken her a week to feel comfortable enough to start to play with the other young dogs in her foster home. She is very athletic and can run fast and jump high. She will need a good-sized fenced yard, a friendly playful dog buddy her age and size, and someone who will take the time to let her get comfortable in her new home. She will need help with housetraining. She is full of surprises as her personality blossoms. Prefer someone who doesn't crate a lot.  Her puppy adoption fee is $350. ****  Want to know more about Nina? Email foster family at ann_donnawell@comcast.net.  Go to www.drna.org to fill out an adoption application.",

If you are interested please contact the owner directly.\n\nChichi is a 2 year-old pit mix that will light up your days! Chichi is the light of the party. She's very high energy, loves to give kisses and to snuggle with you. \n\nChichi was adopted from ACC in June of this year and has been a work in progress in terms of training. She arrived at home not wanting people to touch her much, so it was very hard to even put the harness on her. Right now Chichi is the sweetest dog at home! She loves pets, cuddles and she lets you put her harness on before a walk like a champ. \n\nShe has been living with my cat without any trouble. It was hard at the beginning but after a while she stopped chasing her completely, and now even when my cat runs around like crazy Chichi doesn't care about it. She likes to be a couch potato and when she wakes up, tug-of-war is her favorite game, along with me chasing her to get her toy.\n\nChichi knows sit, stay, down, up, look at me and touch. She's really a fast learner! \n\nBecause Chichi is reactive to other dogs and can get too excited with some strangers in specific settings, her ideal adopter would have previous experience with big dogs and live in a calm area.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Chichi contact Diana Guerra at: dianaguerra14@gmail.com",

You may remember me from the Flinstone liter! All of my puppies have gone to their forever homes, and now its my turn! I love my foster brother and look to him for confidence and guidance, so Id love a home with a male dog. I can be nervous since I lived on the streets for so many years so I prefer a quiet home with no young children. I currently live with a cat and I dont really bother with him much, in fact most of the time I pretend like hes not even there! I love to follow my foster mommy around and cuddle up with her on the couch. It takes me longer to get used to men but with patience and time I know I can do it! I am crate trained...I view my crate as my safe place. I am also house trained and know when its time to go outside to go to the bathroom. I need a person who is patient and will take the time to get to know who I am. Is that you? I promise in return endless love and lots of licks. Wilma needs a 6ft solid fence for her yard and you must own your home. Please apply at charliescrusaders.org",

She gets along smoothly with other dogs and will find a nice little bed to lay in with no issues. She has an accepting personality and her ears flop as she trots along to say hi to you! She's very cute. \n\nCarmella was diagnosed with diabetes after coming into our care. She will need insulin injections twice a day for life and we are looking for a very special, compassionate person to be her family. Thankfully she is very tolerant of her injections so far. \n\nShe is fine for short distanced walks and will ignores other dogs on them. She is mostly low energy and has no problem being left alone. She does not get treats due to her diabetes. Carmella does not give kisses but loves to be petted. Her ideal home is one with low activity and able to administer her care. \n\nCarmella came to us from San Jose Animal Care and Services.",

You would never guess that I have arthritis in one of my hips. I came from a home where a baby didn't respect that injury--so it will be probably best if my furever family has older kids.\nMy foster dad calls me Moods and says I do fun little Husky Hops when I am excited. I get excited when there is food or walks involved- I LOVE food and long walks and hikes. I am not super cuddly but love to give kisses, play with sticks and toys, and of course get pets :)\nIf you have a furever spot for me in your home, please come meet me soon!",

Whether it's playing tug with my favorite rope toy, or going for a walk outside, I'm just happy to have your company! I was so shy when I first came to the shelter but I have come out of my shell so much that now I'm a happy, playful boy. I'm a staff and volunteer favorite and while they take great care of me, I would love to relax for a bit in a foster home while I wait for my forever family. I'm not the best with small animals so I'd do best in a home without them but if you have other dogs my size, I'd love to meet them! I absolutely love toys especially when it means we can play a game of tug!",

BLUE\u2013 Dogs in the BLUE category will need experienced adopters. Ideally, adopters of dogs in the BLUE category will be knowledgeable in the area(s) the dog will be challenging; therefore, adopters should be willing to participate in a training plan to further the work staff and volunteers already have started. \n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nLady Sally is sponsored in loving memory of my fur children\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest.\n\nAdoption Hours: Wednesday\u2013Monday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM  (Closed Tuesdays)\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

            "description": "Follow us on Facebook for updated photos and more information on our adoptable pets!\n\n\nMeet Asher!\nAsher is about 7 months old. He is a purebred German Shepherd. Asher was diagnosed with Juvenile Cataracts in both eyes. He has seen multiple vets and specialists. All agree he may need surgery in the future to correct his vision issues, but they are not severe enough that he should have surgery now. He needs to be evaluated about every 6 months to see if they are progressing. There is a decent chance he may never need surgery. He can see well enough that his vision does not affect his daily life. \n\nAsher is a TYPICAL SHEPHERD. He is very smart, and needs to be worked with. He is young, has lots of puppy energy, and needs clear rules and boundaries with an owner who is very consistent. Asher needs a home with no children, because he needs an owner capable of handling training and continued socialization. \n\nAsher would be a very easy addition to a German Shepherd savvy family. \n\nAn approved adopter for Asher would be someone who has Shepherd experience, time to dedicate to training, and WILL SIGN A TRAINING AGREEMENT. As well as provide proof that he is registered for classes.\n\nAsher is an absolutely amazing puppy, and these things will ensure that he is very successful in his forever home.\nAsher is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. Asher is neutered and is microchipped. Asher's adoption fee is $400 plus WI state tax. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Asher, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet Asher!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

            "description": "Ina is looking for a wonderful home or fosterhome!  She would love a home with a yard she can hang out in,  She is good in a crate and would enjoy a 30-45min walk a day.  She would do best in a home with no kids (teenagers might be ok).  Her ideal home would be GSD/large dog experienced.  She currently is in a boarding environment around other dogs and does fine, but has not interacted with them beyond through fencing.  Ina has not been cat tested.\n\nHere is what we know about this beautiful girl:\n\nThe Fabulous Miss Ina G\n\nIna is a beautiful red and brown, 8 year old German Shepherd, about 100lbs, but is ready to shed a few!  The meaning of her name stems from \u2018mother\u2019, \u2018queen\u2019, \u2018pure\u2019, and to illuminate - so fitting for this girl. Ina is currently in need of a foster/adopter. \n\nIna loves to go for car rides and loads and unloads easily and she has become a champ at the ramp.  She is okay on leash (pulls) but is  easily redirected and is ever so happy to nose around and walk in the grass at the park. She is crate trained as well as house trained and very food motivated.  \n\nIna is friendly with other dogs though the fence but she hasn\u2019t been dog tested nor has she been tested with cats.  She hears and sees well and is German Shepherd smart and very adaptable to new routines.  She doesn\u2019t bark or fuss unless barked at first and even then it\u2019s with a playful sounding response. \n\nIna\u2019s hips are tired but they don\u2019t slow her down and it would appear that she has had more than one litter of puppies.  She currently is on a twice daily dose of gabapentin, an adrenal support supplement, milk thistle and turmeric golden paste.\n\n\nPlease email right away if you would like to learn more about this dog......and visit our website www.siarescuers.org to learn more about our rescue group.   Adoption fees range from $150-$350 for dogs.  THE DOGS SHOWN ON THE SITE ARE IN FOSTERCARE - WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER TO VISIT.  EMAIL is the best way to reach us.We are a volunteer run, very small organization - so please be patient when waiting for a response, but feel free to check back in if you haven't heard from us in a day or so - thank you so much for considering a rescued pooch!",

My sister was found out on a prairie and brought to the shelter, instigating an investigation for other pups.  Traced to Augusta, we were offered new digs at the facility.  We were quite the barnbusters, then split up when adopted to various new homes.  I was in mine for several years, then got this great idea that it was okay and fun to chase and kill chickens that also lived there.  Then, oh my goodness, there were the deer to chase.  I had a grand time and was not about to give either up, so here I am.  I am kind, patient, not good with other pooches (that will be worked on when we have other ones here).  I am very camera shy but you probably already guessed that.  I adore people and submissive with humans.  Tolerate cats nicely.  I have another job assigned to me, and that is to learn how to play.  These people keep waving squeekers in from of me, and throw those goofy round things across the field.  They just get that pathetic  look from me as I shake my head at how they entertain themselves.  Anyway, come and visit me.  I will charm you.\n*Mae went on trial for a couple of days and was returned because of her shy manner, interest in laying on the sofa,  and lack of attention to toys.  But, that is Mae and she continues to be very dedicated to the people around her. Super sweet, but if you are looking for a rambunctious dog, she is not for you.",

            "description": "Hello there, it\u2019s me Dixie. I have quite a long story so sit back. I was found with another dog that my foster mom thinks was my daughter on April 8, 2020 by Sugar Land Animal Services. I was estimated to be three years old when I was found and my companion was about 18 months old. They named me Dixie and her Daisy. Both of us were pregnant and due about the same time. We both went to fosters with Pup Squad to have pups and get adopted.\n\nI had 10 beautiful babies. When they were about 3 weeks old my foster mom saw me have a seizure. My pups went to other fosters to be cared for since I had this condition and need to be cared for. I started down a long road of trying different medications. It\u2019s November and it seems, knock on wood, my seizures are under control.\n\nWell I\u2019m not just known only by my condition. I have a personality that just doesn't stop! I love to play fetch, but I have not quite figured out the drop it and tug-of-war is always fun. Sometimes I just just lay and chew on a bone. My most favorite is meal time. I do help myself to coffee that has been left on the table unattended (hehehe).\n\nI am the most nosey dog that has ever lived in this house from what I hear. If my foster mom is looking at something down low I will get right in between her and what she is trying to look at. I\u2019ve been told I have a big body but that just doesn\u2019t compute so I just walk under small tables and things go flying. My foster brother always sits in the same chair. When I walk between his chair, with him in it, and the couch his chair gets scooted around :)\n\nI am a sweet, loving gal who happens to have some seizures. Don\u2019t let that scare you away because the medicine does help and I am such an awesome dog! I will make someone very happy!\n\nDixie's approx. DOB is 4/1/2017.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted via the online form http://pupsquad.org/adopt/adoption-application.html.\n\nDuring COVID 19 - We may not be able to help coordinate transport out of state due to limited resources on our end and limited transport options to get the dogs to destinations outside of Texas.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org\n",

Here is his video in NC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q8Q3p8oCngc\n\nEddie is 7 years old (approx. DOB 8-14-13), male, 70 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Eddie is a very sweet and handsome boy, good with other dogs and wants to play, has medium energy. a mix of lots of breeds. There's some shepherd in there, maybe some hound (inherent prey drive so no cats please), maybe some lab, maybe a small terrier like a Jack Russell (those ears!)............but he's a big beefy guy! He is full of energy and sits politely for a treat. He loves going for walks outside with his humans! From his VT Foster: Eddie is working on positive reinforcement and knows his basic commands such as Sit, Stay, Down and Paw.....still working on come. He loves people attention and is very comfortable with new people. He loves, walks, peanut butter bones and rubber toys. Eddie is free to roam when left alone and he does best in smaller spaces. He is really food motivated and has made so much progress!! The ideal home would be a fenced in yard where he could run around. He would do best without children or cats but a home that would provide him the training and exercise he needs is most important! Stay tuned for more information as Eddie is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Eddie please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Roo will need an experienced bully breed owner. \n\nRoo prefers the company of her family and is shy when meeting new people, but warms up quickly when given space and time to adjust to them. \n\nRoo is great with older children who respect her space. Roo gets along with big and small dogs. Roo is a little too interested in cats so a home without cats is recommended.  \n\nRoo recently had ACL surgery so she will need to take it easy for a few more months, however she\u2019s healing nicely. \n\nRoo walks well on leash and loves to play with her toys. She\u2019s a sweet girl who will win over your heart with her beautiful champagne coat and light eyes. Roo needs an active home where she can go on daily jobs or hikes. Roo is described as being easy to love and extremely affectionate. Roo\u2019s only vice is she hates being left alone, so she needs someone who can work her through her insecurities. She\u2019d be happiest with a homebody who works part time or works from home.\n\nRoo would make the perfect guard dog for someone who lives alone or someone who doesn\u2019t really have a huge circle of friends that come over frequently.  Reach out today to meet this beautiful girl. Roo is as loyal as they come. \n\nRoo will be attending a training program so she will have the foundations for being an even better version of herself. We just need her forever family to be ready and willing to continue working with her.",

MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR RUPERT'S ADOPTION:\n\n1.  CANNOT LIVE IN AN APARTMENT.\n\n2.  NO CHILDREN UNDER 12.\n\n5 year old male Chiweenie, about 9 pounds. Rupert came into rescue 3 years ago completely feral. As any feral pooch, time and consistency has turned him into a real LOVE BUG! He is as normal a dog as any other, but he does have a few residual fear issues occasionally. He tends to bark at strangers coming into the house and alerts when someone is in the driveway. He lives with many dogs, but would love to have his own person. He takes time to warm up to strangers. Loves to sleep under the covers and will follow you around the house, even to the bathroom! He sticks to his foster like glue. Respectful older children or adult only household would be best. \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.If interested in any of our animals for adoption, or to foster an animal, please fill out the respective application here to get the process started. Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\n\n'Won't you please pay attention to me? I just want to play!'\nMeet Prince, an active 9 year old Black Labrador Retriever / English Pointer mix. Poor Prince was confined to an apartment with no socialization and little attention because the family lost interest in him. LDDR agreed to take Prince and find the right home for him. He is now receiving lots of playtime and TLC in his foster home while waiting for a forever home.\nPrince is your typical busy dog that will do best in a home with an adopter who is willing to work with him to teach him some proper manners. He can be a bit wary of unknown people and would need slow introductions to someone he doesn't know. A fenced yard would be ideal to play ball, as that's his favorite thing to do. Prince walks well on a leash except when a car goes by. He currently has a desire to chase moving cars. He is perfectly house trained and will bark at the door to let you know he needs to go out, and he will bark at the door to come back in, too. Prince is ok with most dogs when properly introduced, but he will grumble if a dog gets too chummy or rude.\nFor more information or questions, email Tim at tmb611@msn.com.\nClick here to watch a video of Prince.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

She greets everyone with affection and enjoys getting \npraise and attention, making visitors feel like old friends.\nShe came into GSRNE in June, after her owner called and said he \nand his wife had gotten a divorce and were each moving to \nhousing where dogs were not allowed.  Their two dogs, 5 \u00bd years \nold, had been littermates and together their whole lives.  He was \nhoping they could stay together, but we explained that it\u2019s \ndifficult to find adopters who can take two dogs at once.  We were\nvery lucky to have a foster home who would do that, but we \nlearned that the two dogs would probably do better if separated.\nFreya is not really interested in toys and actually buried the ones \nshe was given.  Her favorite game was to chase after her brother, \nAries, and nip at his heels while he chased his favorite toy, a \nFrisbee.  That didn\u2019t seem to bother Aries, and Freya continued to \npractice her herding skills.\nThere were two cats in the home, and our evaluator witnessed \ntheir interactions with Freya, who was comfortable having them \naround.  She is not tolerant of other dogs, though, except for her \nbrother.  When there were other dogs in the neighboring fenced \nyard, she would rush to bark at them through the fence and try to\nfence fight.  She is indifferent about going for walks, but will \ngladly accompany you if that\u2019s what you want to do.\nWhen she came into GSRNE, Freya was overweight and trimmed \ndown nicely while in foster care.  Her original owner told us that \nshe had been taught to ring a bell on the door knob or bark when \nshe needed to go out.  When outside in the fenced yard, Freya is \nmore interested in flying insects than most dogs seem to be.  \nOnce she locks in on one, she\u2019ll chase it all around until it flies out\nof sight.\nFreya is ready for her forever home with an adopter who will \nappreciate all the love she has to give and who will give her lots \nof love and affection in return.",

            "description": "Meet Mazerati! He is a sweet boy who can take some time to trust you, but once he does, he is very lovable. He will need owners who are active and can provide lots of training and socialization. He needs adults only and no kids at all. He needs owners that can be firm with him as he will listen better to commands. He is a sensitive boy, so positive reinforcement is really important to him. He is still learning to ride well in a car and not pull on the leash. \n\n\n\n\nFoster notes:\nMazzy is a very lovable and loving dog with a lot of potential. Given his probable lack of socialization and fear of strangers, we think he would be best in an adult-only household, and with someone who understands and will work with a dog who shows some signs of fear/aggression. He needs someone with a lot of patience who is willing to put in the time and energy to teach him rules and boundaries. He improved substantially over just a couple of weeks with regular training and exercise, but he needs firm guidance, consistency, and love. \n\nWhat he loves:\nHe loves squeaky toys and hard chew toys, but essentially, he loves any and all food. He loves cuddling and sleeping in the bed and preventing you from making the bed. He loves laying by your feet while you work, and loves long hikes outside. If he has a chance to be off-leash, he has the goofiest zoomies. He loves to roll in cow pies (beware!) and he loves sticking his head out of the car windows.\n\nWhat he knows:\nHe knows \"sit, \"paw, a little bit of \"stay and \"wait. He is pretty good on the leash unless he is fearful or trying to chase a critter. He has not stolen any food off the table, but he likely would if given the opportunity.\n\nOther dogs:\nHe loves playing with other dogs, but if the other dog shows any signs of aggression or defensiveness, he will likely reciprocate . So he would probably do best hanging out with a familiar dog friend who isn't very reactive. He is also reactive on the leash, so narrow trails and hallways are areas to pay attention to.\n\nStrangers:\nHe used to try to run away from every stranger with his tail between his legs, and he continues to be fearful, especially of larger groups of people. But he has gotten much better and will now stand quietly (albeit a bit warily) and let people pass on hiking trails. He is also terrified of bicycles and skateboards, but has gotten better with them as well. He just hasn't gotten enough socialization in his life, but he will continue to improve.\n\nPotty training: He marked in our house several times (no pooping accidents), but it is likely due to previous dog pee smells. In a different home, he did not have a single peeing incident. He is probably not 100%, but seems like he gets the general idea. \n\nOther notes:\nEven though he is scared of men more than women, he tends to get used to them as long as they are good with dogs. He definitely loved both of us (one female, one male) and slept in our bed every night. Unfortunately, he did show some fear/aggression towards one male roommate, and the situation worsened with time. Thus, we recommend that all household members are fairly experienced with dogs and/or meet him before taking him home. \nHe would do really well in a home with its own large yard where he can play with toys, but he definitely needs plenty of exercise. He really enjoys long hikes, and we have taken him to Wildcat Canyon many times. He will chase wildlife if you're not careful! He also seems to become quite energetic and hyper in the evening time - perhaps because he doesn't enjoy daytime neighborhood walks if lots of people are out and about. He had a tendency to randomly pick things, like pillows or tables, and start chewing, but if he has plenty of toys he'll be fine!\n\n**My adoption fee is one half off! Adoption fee: $200.**",

He\u2019s not interested \nin being petted or fussed over until he gets to know you really \nwell, and then he\u2019ll show you the warm and fuzzy side to his \npersonality.\nHe came into GSRNE in June, 2020, after his owner called and said\nhe and his wife had gotten a divorce and were each moving to \nhousing where dogs were not allowed.  Their two dogs had been littermates and together their whole lives.  He was \nhoping they could stay together, but we explained that it\u2019s \ndifficult to find adopters who can take two dogs at once.  We were\nvery lucky to have a foster home who would do that, but we \nlearned that the two dogs would probably do better if separated.\nAries especially loves his Frisbee but will also dash off after a ball \nor other toy you throw for him to retrieve.  He rushes back, eyes \ndancing, and eager to chase after it again.  His enthusiasm for \njumping to catch the Frisbee did lead to an injury, causing trauma\nto his sciatic nerve when he landed wrong.  He\u2019s been through \nphysical therapy and acupuncture and is back to running, playing \nfetch and going for walks, which is another favorite activity.  No \nmore high jumps for him, though, and he\u2019s just as happy running \nafter ground balls and chasing the Frisbee at ground level.\nWalks should be part of his daily routine, as he looks forward to \nthem and needs that kind of exercise.  He weighed 110 pounds \nwhen he came into GSRNE, and his foster Dad helped him slim \ndown to 90 pounds by walking twice a day as well as measuring \nhis food consistently.  He\u2019s not interested in playing with other \ndogs and would not enjoy a dog park.  He did live with two cats, \nthough, and got along well with them.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an active boy who will want to be by your side\nand just hang out in the evenings, Aries might be just the dog for \nyou!",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Daisy Mae\n\nAge: approximately 11 years old\n\nCurrent Weight: 70 lbs\n\nRescued from: Texas\n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccines, spayed\n\nAdoption fee: $300\n\nDaisy Mae was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. Daisy Mae is very sweet, mellow and low-key. She has a little bit of a hard time going up the stairs due to her age and also seems to be a little hard of hearing. It would be great if she could find a family to give her love and attention in her golden years! It would be great if her adopters had a nice yard where she could wander around and relax while enjoying the outdoors, which she loves!\n\nDaisy Mae will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY once she has a foster or adopter readying to bring her home! To apply to adopt or foster her, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

I\u2019m potty trained but sometimes I have an accident when I get too excited . I\u2019m also crate trained and I tend to go in it by myself when I want to take a nap and it has a fluffy pillow or blanket . At night I do prefer to sleep right beside my foster mom on the carpet. We tried the bed but my foster mom is a cuddler and I tend to get too hot so I usually move in the middle of the night . \n\nI love going on walks with my foster sister Raven . So I do very well with other dogs of all ages . I love when my foster dad gets home and wait for him at the door because he gives me lots and lots of pets and scratches behind my ear. \nMy foster mom says I\u2019m such a good and sweet girl and thinks I\u2019m ready to find my forever home ! \n\nI am heartworm positive and going through slow kill treatment. You see I have lived outside all my life and was abused by my owners.  I was never given hw preventative which is a must in the South.  Please don\u2019t let that prevent you from adopting me.  I will go through treatment and be as good as new and won\u2019t let it slow me down.  \n\nPlease complete an application if you would like to meet me.\nhttps://form.jotform.com/luckymutts/adoption-application\n",

She had a very rough start to life -- she was a stray who had been hit by a car (healed on her own, but has some issues with her hind end because of it) and was hours away from being euthanized in a shelter when she was pulled by a rescue. Patsy Kline is such a smart girl and is very loving and affectionate. She is so deserving of a second chance at a good life, and SNARR is committed to finding that for her!\n\n*NOTE - Patsy Kline would do best in a home without small dogs*\n\nPatsty Kline will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY once she has a foster or adopter readying to bring her home! To apply to adopt or foster her, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary.\n\n",

I think it must have been a long time. Fortunately for me I have a Pup Squad microchip. I was spayed on 1/16/10 and I was about two years old then. So, best guess I am 12 years old. \n\nWhen I was found I had a hematoma in my left ear flap that was so large the flap was about an inch thick. I have had that repaired and my ears packed to get all of the yeast out. I don\u2019t think my ear will ever match the other one but we can say that gives me character.\n\nI don\u2019t think I can hear because my foster mom has to get in my sight before I know what she wants. I love to eat and sleep and sit beside her in her chair. I\u2019m easy peasy.\n\nHowever, I am an alpha dog and will start a fight if I think one of the other dogs is too near the food container, a toy or whatever I perceive is mine. Not sure why I am this way. Maybe my last 10 years have not been kind in regard to other dogs. Because I am this way I need a home with no pets.\n\nI walk great on a leash. I eat, sleep and stay in my house (crate) when no one is home. If out of my house, I will be your shadow!\n\nBirdie's approx. DOB is 10/1/2008.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted via the online form http://pupsquad.org/adopt/adoption-application.html.\n\nDuring COVID 19 - We may not be able to help coordinate transport out of state due to limited resources on our end and limited transport options to get the dogs to destinations outside of Texas.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org",

A gorgeous hunk of hound looking for a forever family.  James is turning 6 this week and is currently enrolled in the TGIE program being obedience train.   James will be graduating in January, he is a rockstar in the program and a staff favorite.    James successfully finished heartworm treatment prior to going to the TGIE program.  He has a helicopter tail and can jump like a kangaroo!  .  James will be officially available for adoption when he graduates.  If you are interested in James please contact Greyt Angels at greytangels@gmail.com or 574-535-3210.  \n\nPlease know we are not a shelter and are NOT open to the public. All meet and greets are arranged only AFTER an application is submitted and reviewed.\n***\nWe LOVE the support and interest of every inquiry on our hounds!!! At this time, however, we are a smaller group, so we must limit our adoptions to a two-hour radius of our home base of Goshen, Indiana. This enables us to better provide support to our adopters and our hounds, when needed, for a more successful adoption experience!",

            "description": "Introducing this darling sweet little mother daughter duo, Mally and Leola! These two girls came into rescue after their owners surrendered them and several other dogs to a dog pound. They were not in a position sadly where they could care for them any longer, and didn\u2019t appear to care for them well while they had them. All of them were afraid but especially the mother, Mally. This girl was so terrified after being surrendered with all of her babies. While Mally is a mom, she is still a youngster, estimated at 18-24 months. Her oldest daughter is Leola who is closer to 12 months old and the two of them are so incredibly bonded. She also had another litter of puppies that were babies, only about 3 months old at the time. Everything was done to ensure that these guys went into foster care as soon as possible. All of Mally\u2019s babies found wonderful forever homes. She found so much comfort and confidence with Leola that we decided it was important to keep them together. It is obvious that Mally has had a very difficult life and has very low self-esteem with new people and new settings, having Leola with her helps her very much.\n\nWe insured that all of their medical work was completed, and now they are waiting for their forever home! They live in a loving foster home together with a kitty and 3 other little dogs and they have blended in cheerfully and are so grateful to be in a kind, warm home where they can enjoy the simple peace of sweet humans and an easy going environment. \nBecause they are unsure of new people, and have a preference of women, we are looking for a forever home with no children where there will be a loving mother figure. In their foster home they are wonderful with their foster daddy too! But it took him some time to earn their trust. Now that they have settled in, they have a wonderful routine! They are super easy going, wonderful pups to have around! Leola is especially cuddly, and they are fabulous! They are happy to trot outside to their fenced yard to go potty, and wait patiently for their parents to come home from work and they greet them with a wagging tail and big smiles! They don\u2019t get into mischief when they are left alone and are happy to just snuggle up together on the sofa when they aren\u2019t playing or exploring. \nMally and Leola are looking for a home with nurturing, patient parents and a fenced yard. They will do just fine with or without other dogs or kitties! Their main goal is just a easy going, committed home who can appreciate these two youngsters didn\u2019t have an easy start and crave a peaceful home life where healthy meals, plush bedding, relaxation and love are in abundance! They probably aren\u2019t ideal for city life or people who want to bring their dogs to cafes or dog parks. They will be happiest with parents who are more  homebodies who enjoy an evening snuggling on the couch being outside enjoying the fall breeze and foliage. \n\nMally and Leola need parents who long to teach pups how good life can be and that there are fabulous humans in this world who will teach them about love, stability, and what a safe, positive home is all about! If you would love to give these girls the future they long for and deserve, please visit our website and submit an application for adoption today! www.greatdivideanimalrescue.org",

She looks as if she is doing a permanent play bow and runs around the home with her siblings just fine.\n\nWillow can be friendly with strangers (if she feels safe with her person around) and loves treats and toys. She does bond to her one adult (she appears to prefer women to men) and does well with well mannered young kids. She knows how to use a dog door!\n\nWillow likes to sleep in bed with you and is used to two dog beds/mats stacked beside the bed so she has a launching pad and cushion to jump up and down on her own. She needs a boost to get into car but will jump out on her own (best to keep a towel or mat handy so she can land softly).\n\nWillow is NOT a fan of a leash, other than a slip lead for an annual vet visit, she will fight a leash. Her ideal home will have a dog door and a yard (so she doesn't have do be walked to potty), one or two stories (ideally carpeted stairs), a female owner with or without dog savvy kids or grandkids. Yes, pretty specific, but she will be your couch buddy, bed buddy and snuggler.\n\nWillow is eating kibble, but loves a bit of broth, bacon fat, a bit of leftovers on top to make it oh so much tastier! 2/2/21 4:21 PM",

He can forget how strong he is at times and be a little too enthusiastic when greeting, but he's attentive to his people and has been enjoying working on his manners. He loves being active especially playing in water and hiking so he'd be a good partner for someone looking for an adventure buddy. Josh likes to be the center of attention so would prefer to live in a house with no other pets so he can receive all the love!\n\nIf you think Josh would be a good fit for you or your family, or if you would like to learn more, click \"Adopt Josh\" above to complete our survey and be connected with an Adoption Specialist.",

A fenced yard is a must have for this bundle of energy. We currently walk him up to 5+ miles a day to make sure he gets exercise. We recommend a fenced in yard for this guy and an active family. He loves petting and thinks he is a lap dog! Not a mean bone in his body. Loves other dogs but doesn't know his own strength so an evenly matched size dog would allow him to full out play likes he wants to. Crate trained.\n\nADOPT FELIX!!!!! www.LuckyPupRescueSC.com The adoption fee is $250.00 and we require a vet check and home visit (virtual). Felix has been neutered, dewormed, hw tested, chipped & vaccinated. He is on monthly prevention for flea/ticks and heartworms.",

He is a fast learner. At first when I went to put a harness on him he would have none of that. But after letting him decide when, he let me put the harness on without any problems. He does have a big head but once he allowed it the harness went right over it. He gives great kisses and thinks he's a lap dog. He does get nervous around strangers but if you give him time and don't rush he does good. It only took him a couple of hours when he let me walk him, he walks great on a leash. He comes with his own kennel. He loves his ears rubbed, to play fetch and chew on his bones. Unfortunately no cats or children. This is an amazing boy who is looking for his forever home. He will be completely vetted on 10/1/2020 and ready to go to his forever home. Apply at fromforgottentoforever.com/adoptionapplication/.",

We are heartbroken for this sweet girl, but we know her life is about to get good! Zena is friendly with people, and is being recommended for a home with kids 15 and up. This 5 year old baby is very petite, weighing in at 52 itty bitty pounds. She is house trained and knows \"sit\", \"down\" and \"touch\". Zena is looking for an active household as she is energetic and loves to play. Zena is recommended to go as a solo pet.

Here is what we have noticed about her: she is excellent with all other dogs, both small and large and enjoys their company. She is house-trained. \n\nMomma settles very well in the house both during the day and at night and she will let you sleep in. Momma is loyal - she will take some time to bond, but when she does, she will show you how happy she is to see you, even if you are just returning from another room in the house:)\n\nShe is calm, mild mannered, easy going and would perfectly suit a person or family that doesn't have time for a high-energy pup. Momma will need a family with a well-fenced yard as she is still learning to walk on a leash and enjoys laying out in the sun during the day. \n\nMomma is one sweet, gentle, shy girl. She has not been cat tested but we would not be surprised if she was fine with a cat companion. Please reach out if you think you may have a home for Momma and we will put you in touch with her foster family.",

Due to a large volume of calls and emails, we can ONLY ensure responses to those who fill out an application on the Carolina Hearts website (link below).\n\nhttp://carolinaheartsrescue.org/adoption-information/\n\nAVAILABLE: Vesper **HERDER EXPERIENCED HOME REQUIRED**\n\nNO: children, female dogs, small pets, or livestock\n\nVesper, from James Bond, means evening in Latin. Vesper was bought as a cute little merle puppy by a loving family that was mesmerized by a cute fluff ball with ice blue eyes. Unfortunately, as she grew up they realized that Aussies aren\u2019t the breed for them and their growing family which led to their decision to surrender her to rescue. \n\nVesper can be slow to warm up to strangers, but once she has she does bond quickly to her person. She can be quite reserved with strangers to her home and will bark when new folks initially enter or drive up. Vesper does well with the little female dogs in her foster home, but butts heads with the resident Aussie gal. She does tolerate her male Aussie foster sibling, as long as he is respectful. \nVesper has a VERY high prey drive and is not suitable for a home with cats, chickens, or other \u201cprey-like\u201d pets. Vesper enjoys escaping fences and cannot be left unattended, fortunately she does have very good recall and comes back when called. She is fairly high energy and WILL REQUIRE a herding dog savvy home WITHOUT children or small animals that will help her use her energy and smarts for good, not evil. She would likely excel dog sports. Vesper listens well, knows basic commands, is good on a leash, and loves car rides. \n\nVesper is more than just a pretty face and will need a home that will continue to work with her to trust men and strangers and to work to exercise her mind and body. She is two years old, spayed, UTD on vaccines, microchipped, and on heartworm preventatives. Vesper is currently fostered in Pittsboro, NC and her adoption fee is $300. \n\nIf you are an approved applicant and are interested in Vesper please contact the adoption committee. If you are interested and not yet approved please visit our website for adoption procedures and application.\n",

I would do best in a home without young children. I'm just a year old, spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm tested. My adoption fee is $99\nIn response to the social distancing recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the Roanoke Valley SPCA is modifying our adoption procedures. With these new restrictions, we do our best to be as fair as possible. Pets are adopted on a first come basis. Our challenge is to find homes for the pets in our care as quickly as possible so we can help other pets in need. With the increase in cases in Southwest Virginia, adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday between Noon and 7 pm. Unfortunately, we are unable to hold pets nor guarantee a pet will be available at the time of your appointment, but we do promise to call you if a pet is adopted prior to your appointment.\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please compete our online Adoption Application. Please book your appointment to meet me. Our adoption staff will give you a call to confirm the appointment and answer any questions you may have prior to the meet and greet.\nCall 540-339-9247 Monday - Saturday between Noon and 7 pm to speak with an adoption counselor for more information.\n2/2/21 1:04 PM",

            "description": "Sophia came to our rescue from Louisiana after a hurricane damaged the mobile home she was living in. Her owner turned her over to rescue along with 8 other siblings. Sophia is about 6 years old and weighs about 7 1/2 pounds. Her mother was a Pomeranian and her father was a chihuahua, so Sophia is a pomchi mix. According to the previous owner, Sophia never left the trailer and never saw anyone but her. She was not potty trained to go outside, but she's doing really well now with pottying outside. She does use potty pads inside, if needed. We are also working on leash training since she had never worn a collar or harness. She's such a good girl and very easy to care for. Sophia gets along well with other dogs, and will occasionally play. She does okay with our cats. She is okay with older children, but younger active children make her a little nervous and she hides. Sophia does warm up to her person after a few days, but she will need a patient and experienced owner to give her the time that she needs. Once she trusts you, she loves to be on your lap and cuddle. She will stand up on her hind legs when she's waiting for a treat...so cute. Sophia will be a wonderful companion for someone who wants a sweet, quiet little girl. Sophia has been spayed, is heartworm negative, had a dental, and has been updated on her vaccinations. She would love a new home where she can settle in and feel safe and comfortable.\nIn order to adopt, you need to send an e-mail to rescue@secondchancepoms.org asking for an application.  After you send this back, we will check references and someone will visit you in your home to discuss adoption.  We ask a donation of $425 for adults, which includes an applicable Texas sales tax, and $475 for puppies, which includes an applicable Texas sales tax.  This covers shots, spay/neuter, and any medical treatment, such as de-worming. We do not ship our pomeranians, but an out-of-state adoption can still happen if the adopter comes to the Houston, TX area to pick up their pom.",

He has been with Tiny Cause Rescue since September of 2020 and has had very little interest. Whats not to love about this beautiful brindle boy?  He is a sweet loving boy who is very active with a nice with a side of silliness. Elmo just wants to be with his people. He walks terrific on a leash and looks to his walker for direction. He's crate trained, potty trained and friendly with other dogs but can be dog selective. NO CATS FOR ELMO. He likes kids but might be too much to live with little ones as he can be a bit of a bulldozer when excited (unintentionally of course). Elmo is doing excellent on learning to stay down, he knows how to sit, and hes working on learning how to lay down. Elmo really just wants to find his forever loving home. \nHis adoption fee is $150.00 which includes being up to date on vaccinations including rabies & bordetella, microchipped, dewormed, on flea/tick preventative and neutered.\nWe are a FOSTER based dog rescue therefore there isn't one central location with open hours to see our available dogs. They are all in loving foster homes enjoying learning how to be a furry family member. If interested we only set up meet and greets AFTER approving adoption applications with interested adopters as to not waste anyone's time.\nAll current/past pets MUST be up kept to date on vaccinations as well as being spayed/neutered to adopt from our rescue.",

He loves to play with toys of all kinds. He enjoys going for walks, but also would enjoy a relaxing afternoon snuggled up with you on the couch. In Chester's forever home he would do best as the only dog in the home. If he were to find a home with children they need to be teenagers and older. \n\nCan you envision this bundle of joy in your home, contact our adoption counselors at 234-212-9843 to learn more about Chester and how our adoption by appointment program works!",

            "description": "Zulu #6708 is a 4-year-old male, Bull Mastiff mix.  Give Zulu a chance to earn your trust and love; he\u2019ll be your best friend ever. He is nervous and shy when you first meet him. He will definitely require patience and time with his new adopter(s) in order to gain his trust. But once he does trust you, he is a completely different dog. He has high energy and would love a large backyard to play in. He will do best in a quiet, low activity household; he doesn't like loud noises; because of this no children in the home.  Zulu is good with other dogs.  He is very treat-motivated and knows the commands: sit, stay, off, down and come. He walks great on a leash. He is eager to meet new dogs when out on walks. We are looking for an adopter with experience with scared dogs. . He weighs 95 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities\n",

            "description": "Blue is a joyful, energetic guy who would also VERY much like to lie on the couch with you. He has been known to take a running leap across the room to get in on some snuggles. When he\u2019s happy (which is often - Blue is inclined to happiness), he grunts quietly like a small blue pig. Blue will make you laugh a lot, and sometimes it seems like he understands the jokes, too.\n\nBlue is friendly and always politely pleased to meet new people (especially if they pet him), but he reserves his heart for his own people.  He is sensitive to what\u2019s going on in the home, and knows when it\u2019s time to play and when it\u2019s time to check out and take a nap. He\u2019s a smart dog, and learns quickly, especially when motivated by treats.\n\nBlue is an athlete, strong and nimble and always up for a long walk or a romp. He is working on his leash manners and tends to pull and bark at bicycles and other dogs, especially if he sees more than one of those things in quick succession, so a quiet neighborhood would be best. His foster parents have been working on this with him and have brought him a long way, and we know with continued guidance he can only get better. He just gets so excited and engaged by the things around him that he forgets there\u2019s a person at the other end of the leash. Because of this, Blue would benefit from a home with an enclosed yard where he can play and get his energy out before working on his leash walking. He will also need to be the only pet in the house, but don't worry he has enough personality to fit all your needs. \n\nBlue is house trained and sleeps calmly in a closed crate overnight. He prefers not to be separated from his beloved people, but is okay as long as he is given free range of the couch to nap while you\u2019re away. Because of his leash-reactivity, Blue will do best in a home with a family that\u2019s committed to working on consistent positive reinforcement training. In exchange, he will provide you with infinite snuggles, vigorous tail-wagging, and bounces of delight.\n\n?6 years old-45lbs. My adoption fee is $180 and includes microchip, neuter, reduced-cost training class, 1 month pet health insurance, free veterinary exam, leash/collar, food sample, toy & treat packet.",

            "description": "Clark - Coonhound/Bloodhound - Male - 1.5 Years - www.twyla.org\n\nIf you'd like to know more about this dog please visit www.twyla.org\n\nMeet Clark: This gorgeous Boy is a Bluetick Coonhound/Bloodhound (we think) and the vet estimates he is about 1.5 years old. Clark was found with his sidekick \"Lewis\" while exploring Kingwood unaccompanied, and was saved by a good Samaritan who contacted us. Clark is quite a typical hound - he is happiest when he can follow his nose and an hang out close to the other dogs in his foster home and his people. He is quite aloof and takes a while to make eye contact with a new person, but he keeps close tabs on the people he trusts - he's usually not far from them and positions himself in spot in the house that allows for maximum coverage of all people and dogs. He gets along with all dogs he has met so far, he plays with some and is content to parallel live next to others.\u00a0He loves \"his\" people and politely greets strangers, but takes a little while to include newcomers into his circle. Despite his considerate size he is quite gentle and affectionate. He is also quite talented at squeezing past a person in an open door, so he is looking for a secure yard with a family that know how to keep him contained when the front door opens, he's quite the opportunist.\u00a0\n\nClark is pretty calm and is looking for a moderately active home to include him in lots of outings, but more important would be another similar-sized dog for him to bond to. With strong hound-genes he vocalizes dissatisfaction so he shouldn't be left alone for long periods of time, he needs adequate exercise, mental stimulation and training to be happy and to curb his interest in jail breaking. He has learned to run next to a bike and gets very very excited when he he sees the bike getting ready. Clark seems to be an experienced fence jumper and chain link fence under 7 feet do not contain him, so we are looking for a home with solid 6-7 foot wooden fencing and someone who is home a lot to monitor him.\u00a0\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

Please click the link on our Adopt page (by species) to make an adoption appointment.Hi there, I'm Kovu. Being at the shelter makes me very nervous, but the people that I trust are making it pretty comfortable. I am very shy and nervous at first, but once I trust someone, I'm super friendly and silly. I am a huge fan of belly rubs, and only my most trusted inner circle get to experience my joy in the rubbing of my belly. My friends say that my personality really starts to show once I start to trust someone, and I think they are right. Since coming out of my shell, I'm kinda bossy while playing with other dogs. I enjoy playing with dogs, but I would need to be the only dog in the home because I am not a fan a sharing my things. No human siblings either, they scare me too much. I'm absolutely a dog worth going out on a limb for, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a stunner. I'm saying it because I've got lots of love to give, and I do want a home to call my own.",

The effects of spina bifida vary by individual case, so we feel grateful to report that Petey is walking and playing like a normal puppy, and quickly picks up on cues from his foster mom and other dogs (and cats) in the house. However, he is somewhat incontinent, which requires frequent trips outside, and also diapers. We have also experimented with acupuncture and other treatments for him. Good thing he\u2019s cute though. Aside from incontinence, Petey is otherwise very low maintenance. \n\nHis favorite spot is to lay on the cool kitchen floor while you cook or on the porch near the BBQ, and he is full of puppy kisses and snuggles. \n\nAn ideal home will provide easy and frequent access outside, and work to understand Petey\u2019s special needs. He would do well with in a home with or without kids and other animals.\n\nFill out an application for Petey on our website! NewOrleansBulldogs.com",

Poor Tucker has just never been able to find a family who loves him unconditionally and can make a commitment to him! \n\nTucker is a very laid back guy who enjoys lounging in the sun, napping and watching TV. He is also happy to go for runs or chase balls around the yard. Tucker does not care for other animals and does take his possessions at little too seriously at times. He would be successful in a quiet, adult only home where he can play when he wants to play and relax when he wants to relax. He is house trained and has very good house manners.\n\n\nA reduced adoption fee of $100 does apply for Tucker, our seniors, special medical and behavioral needs dogs and other \"slow to adopt\" dogs! \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries. For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.org",

She is extremely shy around men. \n\nSadie is fearful of many things, she needs an owner that will help her continue to experience life and build her confidence. \n\nShe is a lover of individual attention and of learning new things. She just need a PATIENT person to understand that so many things are new experiences for her.\n\nSadie needs a fenced yard! She also needs to have a female as her owner/main caretaker. She would do best in a home that doesn\u2019t have loads of strangers stopping in. \n\nIf you are ready for the absolute sweetest girl and have the time to help her, we would LOVE to meet you! \n\nSadie is fully vetted- spayed, microchipped and current on vaccinations. She also comes with 6 weeks of positive reinforcement obedience training! Sadie's adoption fee has been sponsored. \n\nTO MEET SADIE YOU MUST FIRST COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION!! \n\nPlease visit hope-rescue.org to read about our adoption process and complete our adoption application.",

Foster to adopt situations have proven to be successful for feral dogs.\n\nFeral dogs require patience, stability, routines/structure and other canine siblings to build confidence and assure them that humans are ok. We also do not recommend younger children - feral dogs need calm households. And....Scout must have a fenced in yard. They are worth the wait......\n\nADOPT SCOUT!!!!! www.LuckyPupRescueSC.com The adoption fee is $250.00 and we require a vet check and home visit (virtual). Scout has been spayed, vaccinated, chipped, dewormed and current on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.\n\n2/2/21 11:48 AM",

I was previously adopted from a rescue by a nice lady who was my owner since??. I returned to the rescue after she suddenly became ill. Since then I\u2019ve been in a foster home with my foster mom and her teenage foster daughter. I live with 2 senior Eskies, a Pyrenees, cats, and a pig (yes you read that right. I find her kind of annoying and weird but I tolerate it). You can always find me by my foster moms side. She calls me her shadow. I like to hang with Georgia a lot (15 y/o female Eskie). She is always with foster mom too so we\u2019re her shadow doubles. \n\nDon\u2019t let my age fool you, I turn 12 in November and I\u2019m a 9lb spunky little guy. I do enjoy naps but also like to play with toys. I really like when my foster mom gives me treats, my favorite is baby carrots. I like to be picked up and carried around. I have my foster grandma trained to pick me up whenever she comes over ?. Foster mom says sometimes I do have issues with \u201cdemand barking\u201d so I\u2019m working on it. Oh, I\u2019m also working on house training. I was trained before but with all the changes and being around many animals in a new place I will mark. I\u2019m very good about wearing my belly band diaper in the house though. sometimes have a problem going #2. I don\u2019t like being outside when it\u2019s cold and might run back in too quick. Foster mom says I\u2019m a quick learner and should get back on track with crate training. I just haven\u2019t liked being in the crate here because all my siblings are out and about. \n\nI sleep in the bed with foster mom at night and like to cuddle up under the blanket. I am pretty fashionable too and have some shirts I like to wear. I wear a harness (collars aren\u2019t good for me bc of the pressure on my trachea can make Me cough) and walk well on a leash. Foster mom says I have pretty good recall but she has caught me trying to be an escape artist in the backyard. One time she caught me right as I snuck out and started to explore the neighborhood (well, fields and a couple houses). She eventually caught upto me and picked me up. I didn\u2019t think much of it but she got really scared and worried. She blocked off that part of the fence and I haven\u2019t tried my escape tricks again. \n\nI like it here but it\u2019s been a big adjustment and I can get worked up sometimes barking with the other dogs. Every time I bark my foster sister, the Pyr, runs to the window barking. Foster mom says I may be small but I sure can run things. So I\u2019d like to go back to a home that\u2019s a little calmer. If I had a companion like Georgia that would be nice. I don\u2019t really like the cats and will chase them sometimes so I\u2019d like to be in a home without cats too. Foster mom says I\u2019m a very sweet and cute little guy that bonded quickly with her and feel safe having her as my person. So It would be great if I had a human who was home a lot to be my pal. Overall I\u2019m a pretty go with the flow kind of guy. \n\nOh and I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve done great and the vet and groomer. I didn\u2019t like when they trimmed my nails -ugh so annoying- but they were so impressed with how well I did with my bath and drying off. I really showed off my fancy prance after I got all clean and fluffy. \n\n*Will get car sick but not if he\u2019s given the homeopathic medicine before a trip (30-60 mins before). I will donate some to go with him to his forever home. \n*Health: has the heart murmur and the other chronic issue that might flare up and need meds. He\u2019s very good about taking his pills with peanut butter, also has the issue where is leg/knee will move out of place (I can\u2019t remember the details exactly, my Vet mentioned it at the first visit but said it\u2019s common in small dogs and not a big deal)",

            "description": "Hey Wisconsin, I'm ready to find a home to call my own. I've been here since the beginning of June, but needed some extra TLC before I started looking. I'm a 1 yo Carolina Dog Mix, also known as a Dingo, which means I'm 45 pounds of energy. Before I tell you about my time in WI you need to know a little bit about my Alabama life. My sister and I were left on a back road as puppies, so there was very minimal interaction with humans. The little time I saw them was not a good experience, however SPR sent some angels out to save us. After 2 months of trying to catch us with a live trap, we were finally caught. Shortly after that I came to WI to for more one on one time with a loving family in their home.\nIn my foster home I'm enjoying the joys of getting pets, playing with stuffed toys and Wisconsin cheese. I'm potty trained and do good in my kennel. I found out the kennel is a safe place to be if something startles me. My leash skills are good, but my foster mom will tell you in the beginning that I get excited so I will pull a bit. The best is when my foster dad takes me for these runs. Sometimes I wear him out! Hehehe. There is also a 13 year old girl in the house. She has been very patient with me. But no young kids for me as they are quick and sometimes loud so it scares me. My new home must be very patient with me as new things can be overwhelming. My foster home also has this dog that is showing me how wonderful life can be. I'm a monkey see monkey do kind of dog, so a confident dog in my new home is a must. Another thing that is a must is a martingale collar. That way if I get scared and pull I won't slip out. My fosters can explain this to you. A six foot high fenced in yard is very ideal for me since I'm an energetic pup yet. If you feel you are the right fit fill out an application at sandipaws.org thank you for taking time to read about me.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets. You can find information for volunteering o. our site as well.",

She loves people and loves to give kisses. She is very eager to please and would do well in obedience training. She would do best in a fenced in yard. If you would like to make Leona a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org\nLEONA'S ADOPTION FEE IS $170\n\n*Due to Covid 19 restrictions some of our new intakes vet scheduling has been delayed. We will still go ahead and schedule your meet and greet even if all the vetting needed has not been completed. Once vetting is complete the approved adopter will be able to take their dog/cat home to their forever home.The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Meet Spike! Spike is a 2 year old Pit bull mix. Spike will when you over with his big smile and awesome personality. Spike loves to play, and gets the ZOOMIES! Spike needs a home with no small children (due to energy/playfulness) and without cats. Spike has done well with other dogs his size. Spike needs an active family to help him burn that puppy energy. If you would like to make Spike a part of your family, please fill out an adoption application at www.barktownrescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $170\n\n*Due to Covid 19 restrictions some of our new intakes vet scheduling has been delayed. We will still go ahead and schedule your meet and greet even if all the vetting needed has not been completed. Once vetting is complete the approved adopter will be able to take their dog/cat home to their forever home.The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

After recovering from his last procedure Leo was able to transfer to a longer term foster home. \n\nIn Leo's current foster home he lives with dogs, cats and birds. \nHis foster mom understands that patience is a virtue, their bond grows stronger with each day. He has been enjoying playtime & snuggles with a variety of sizes of canines from Great Danes to Chihuahua mixes. \n\nLeo does well with confident cats who are part of the pack but can go into typical terrier \"chase mode\" when seeing a kitty dart across the room. \n\nHe LOVES to strut his stuff on walks & hikes. \n\nHis Instagram hashtag is #LeonardoTheNinjaTurtleDog\n\nLeo takes a minute to warm up to new people but seems to gravitate to women. He is working on building confidence with men and would NOT be well suited for a home with young children.",

Her foster mom and Roxy met me at the park and we had so much fun watching Roxy explore. Roxy is ~5.5 yrs. old, an adorable Staffordshire Terrier mix saved from a miserable life of breeding. Rescue Ridge stepped up to save her and she is doing great in her foster home. Roxy loves people of all ages. She is affectionate, well-mannered, and kind. Roxy has great house manners and is fully housebroken/ crate trained, and is a pleasure to have in the foster home. She takes toys, treats, food gently, and is treat motivated. Roxy will give you her paw in exchange for a nice treat. She loves car rides, too! In the home, she is a terrific snuggler so turn on some movies and spend quality time with a truly loving girl. Roxy walks fairly well on a leash, just excited when she sees a squirrel LOL or another dog. Roxy loves to go for walks so put on your walking shoes and have a great time with Roxy! She prefers to be your one and only pet and with such a loving nature you truly won't need more. Please apply to adopt Roxy in central NJ at\nRescueridge.com\nand if your application is a possible match a volunteer will get back to you within 72 hours. Here is Roxy's video\nhttps://youtu.be/b1HoeRAS2-8debut\nPlease adopt Roxy. You won't regret it for a minute.",

The puppies are all in foster care so it's her turn to find a foster home. Deena is about 35 lbs, dog friendly, and hasn't had any accidents in the house. She is HW+ and will need to get treatment in October. \n\nMeet our little fashionista pups and their beautiful mom. Deena is so very sweet and kind. We are calling her a little angel.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org.

We are very  protective of Reina and want her to have a home with no kids and where she is the only pet because she needs, and deserves,  to live out her last years as the only queen of the house.

He is happy to run errands and go on hikes and equally as happy to just cuddle on the couch. He walks well on a leash and is completely obedience trained - both on and off leash. He is very friendly and loving - good with kids and cats and is house broken and crate trained. He is very food motivated and LOVES to tug. \n\nThe only real negative about Leon is that he can be dog selective. He currently lives with two other dogs and is easily managed.\n\nHe would be a perfect dog for anyone. If interested, please contact Pam at (513) 806-3453\n",

She has lots of energy, plays well with others, and fits right in with her 4 canine foster siblings. What makes her so special is what she is a parapeligic pup! She gets around the house and yard scooting, and on walks she uses her wheels, and she has a chariot which helps with transport (these will go to her forever home with her).\nShe doesn't let her legs slow her down, and loves running in the yard with her friends!\nShe does need some assistance going potty, but is such a doll.\n\nLiesl's perfect home will be someone who looks beyond her additional needs and understands you will get 110% back in love and attention - for the extra energy she will need in her daily routine. While her foster family loves her to the moon and back, there are more special cases like her that they want to continue to help with.\n\nAs a POPB adoptable, Liesl is eligible for 5 free obedience classes with her new family! We have adoption events every Saturday from 10 am to 1 pm at Petco in Gainesville, at 6869 W. Newberry Rd. (near the mall) and at the Millhopper Petsmart, 4119 NW 16th Ave. We also have special events regularly. Please visit our Facebook page (facebook.com/plentyofpitbulls) for information about upcoming events.

            "description": "BIO: PRINCESS, 10 year-young female GSD ISO of my \"person\" for the new year ? \n\nHello! WOOF! My name is Princess, and that I surely am! I am a super-sweet velcro 65-pound GSD being fostered at a home in Ventura, CA for SPARC (Santa Paula Animal Rescue Center). I live with two older retriever packmates and whilst I am very happy in my foster home, I really want to find *my* person/people. Please note: adoption will be through SPARC; her shelter listing is here: \nhttp://ws.petango.com/webservices/adoptablesearch/wsAdoptableAnimalDetails.aspx?id=45599236&css=http://ws.petango.com/WebServices/adoptablesearch/css/styles.css&PopUp=true) \nWith reasonable notice, my foster mom is willing to transport me to SLO for a meet and greet once you are approved by the shelter.\n\nBackground:\nI am an OTI due to no fault of my own. My elderly owner passed away and her son took me in, though he did not want me in the house so kept me in the yard without enough food, exercise or socialization to thrive (duration unknown), then turned me into SPARC in late September 2020. A friend of the shelter put out the call for a volunteer and my foster mom stepped up 10/10/20, as I was not doing well at the shelter -- I was very stressed and sad and shut down. My foster knew that I could be rehabilitated both emotionally and physically with the right environment and calm, happy packmates.\n\nMy furfriends really helped me come out of my shell and get comfortable with the nice life in a home outside of the scary shelter (the staff were very friendly and understanding, I am just not a good candidate for kennel life with high-energy dogs barking all the time - they make me very nervous). When coming into foster care, I was underweight, had ongoing skin and ear issues, had a ton of fur loss, and needed to be walked with the support of a sling as I have spondylosis (a fused spine). Within the first hour of being in my current foster home, I relaxed and took a well-needed snooze within feet of my new foster fur brother and sister. We dropped the sling after the first week, as I was able to gain muscle mass with increasingly longer walks and physical exercises to make me strong. Despite my underlying structural condition, I am able to do everything my pack mates can: I go up and down a few stairs in my one-story home, I can get in and out of the car without aid, and can walk, trot and run with relative ease (although the latter can be a little \"clumsy\" sometimes due to my spinal issues). Nothing stops me! I have a great amount of go for my age and gusto to explore. My fur has all grown back in (and some of it is kind of wooly, rather cute if I may say so myself).\n\nHere are the fabulous things my foster mom knows about me:\nI am housetrained and I will wait by the back door to go out if it is not open\nI sleep well through the night on a dog bed\nI eat my breakfast and dinner like a champ\nI walk well on a leash, though am strong and can pull if I see something that I would like to chase\nI love car rides\nI love belly rubs and rolling upside down in the grass at the park\nI have a pretty high prey drive so I don't think that kitties, birds or other furries will be good housemates for me\nI enjoy my medicated baths, and \"accept\" my weekly ear flushing\nI am friendly with all of people I have met on my walks and coming into my foster home, and I am quiet with my greetings (no jumping, barking, etc.)\n\nMy foster mom thinks I will do best in a home with calm, older pack mate(s), or with a person who is home a lot. I exhibited a fair bit of separation anxiety when my foster mom left the house, but we worked on that together and now I am fine and just wait on my dog bed in the front window for her to return home. I have not been left on my own without one or both of my fur pals. My foster mom walks me separately in the morning for my \"long\" walk (approx. a mile and a half) so that I can get used to being out on my own. I am definitely more nervous alone than on my afternoon \"short\" walks (approx. 4-8 blocks) with my 2 pack mates.\n\nI am not a good candidate for a home with balance-compromised owners, young kids who might climb on me, or exuberant / high energy dog pals.\n\nI react in-kind to dogs' energies ... calm, soft posture, tail wagging, I do the same. Exuberant or high-energy dogs, I bark and lunge and think that it is appropriate for me to try to engage with snapping teeth (foster mom's note: this does not strike me as \"aggressive\", just rather an unsocialized response, Princess was very mouthy with me to begin with and we have curtailed the mouth on my hands).\n\nI exercise on-leash only and have been working hard on \"leave it\" (cats, high-energy dogs) then my foster Mom calls my name and I turn to look at her, sit, get a treat, and calm down before we continue our walk.\n\nI do not have resource guarding issues, I live with, eat, exercise and take treats with my 2 packmates.\n\nI love to take multiple daily walks but am not a running/hiking or dog park partner.\n\nI think I did not have a lot of boundaries in my original home, my attitude is \"I want what I want when I want it!\" so my foster mom has been working on \"leave it\", not door dashing, sitting for treats, waiting my turn for treats, etc. I am very smart and most definitely a \"people-pleaser\", so I will continue to do well with an owner who is willing to keep up my training / socialization.\n\nAccording to the vet at SPARC, I should have my ears flushed with a medicated wash once a week, continue to have regular (1-2x/month) medicated baths and am taking Carprofen and Gabapentin daily.\n\nPlease get in touch if you are interested in a super-friendly older pup who wants nothing more than to chill with her person and please you. WOOF! DOG LICK!",

This sweet girl has been such a wonderful mama to her babies and she is ready to be loved as much in return now that her pups are all getting settled in their forever homes.  \n\nLola is lovely! This darling girl is gorgeous. With her milk-chocolate colored fur and her caramel colored eyes, one look at Lola and it\u2019s clear that she is a sweetie pie through and through. \n\nLola is learning! After spending some time as a stray, Lola is learning all there is to know about being a family dog. Her favorite hobby is to go on walks and explore the great outdoors.  She has been hard at work practicing her leash manners so that she can go on lots of adventures with her new family!\n\nLola is loyal! She can be a bit shy at first but once she warms up she is yours forever. With her easygoing personality and mellow temperament, Lola will fit in great in most homes.  She has come so far in her time at the shelter and a fresh start in a new home is exactly what she needs. \n\nLola would thrive in a home that is willing to be patient with her as she adjusts and adapts to her new surroundings.  With calm and kind people around her, Lola will flourish in her new home and return the love she receives tenfold. If this sweet pup sound like the right fit for your home, apply to meet Lola today!\n",

Horn is a very sweet boy, looking for a family to adopt and love; he has a great personality!\n \nHeres what he wants to tell you:\n\nHi! I am very lively, happy, and love to be close by with my foster family. In fact, I like to keep close with them in the house, just to make sure they dont get lonely. They say Im the sweetest, gentlest dog, and want to please. I love to be around people, get petted, go on walks and be a loyal companion. I dont really like to be left alone very much and can do a bit of howling. Because of that, I would do best in a single family home or maybe a townhouse; apartment living is not for me.\n \nI want to run and play a lot so need tons of walks and exercise. I love to play with other dogs, so playdates and trips to the dog park will be great for me even if I dont have a doggy sibling. Human siblings would be great too! I'd be great with kids, both large and small.\n \nThey think I may have been an outdoor dog before, and love to be outside hanging out on the deck where I can watch and monitor the neighborhood. My favorite activity is taking walks. I am starting to figure out how to walk on a leash but there are so many exciting smells on my walks, that its just too exciting sometimes! Riding in the car is also exciting, although long rides are boring so I tend to get impatient and whine when I have to ride for a long time. I just want to get out and explore!\n\nI quickly learned house manners and where everything is (especially the kitchen!). \n \nMy dream is to adopt a family that can provide lots of love and Ill provide lots of love in return!\n\nCheck our more pictures and videos of me here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yzr919vgpcptfhf/AAAvRuE48_DIlf4ePtrFVD35a?dl=0\n\nPAW places animals in the Washington DC Metropolitan area only.",

Harley may be a little cautious at first, but she is quick to warm up to you. She is one of the most loving dogs ever!\n\nNot only is Harley a lover, she is smart too. She has been quick to learn most basic training. I'm sure she'd be quick to learn other things as well. Harley loves to go for car rides, camp, and play, but she really loves to cuddle and lay by your side the most. Sigh... Harley gets along with cats, but she will do best as the only dog in the house. Although she gets along with other dogs in general, it seems that altercations may happen when in a household setting. All Harley wants and deserves is her forever home. Apply to meet Harley today.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

So, here she is, looking for her new home!  Say hello to Daisy Mae!  She has come to us from local Animal Control where she ended up thru no fault of her own. She is a 4 year old Chihuahua Jack Russell mix, who is weighing in at 15 pounds. She is fully vaccinated, HW-, micro chipped and spayed. She does walk well on a leash, gets along good with other dogs and children. She is housebroken and crate trained, but if not gotten outside, she will have accident inside. Daisy enjoys sitting next to you on the couch, and will become your best pal! She has the cutest overbite, where her bottom jaw is shorter than her top jaw, but that just adds to her cuteness! She has had multiple litters, but that is all in the past for her now!  She must go to a home with NO CATS. \nPLEASE NO FIRST TIME DOG OWNERS OR RENTERS, AND MUST HAVE A VET REFERENCE.\n\n**GOOD VET REFERENCE IS REQUIRED**\n\n",

            "description": "Lexi came to us from a local shelter as she was so scared to come away from the wall her chances of being adopted were slim. She is between 1.5 \u2013 2 years old and ready to start her life. Lexi is a fun and eager puppy who thrives on the attention and love from her people. She is super shy at first but after she gets use to you, she is a super happy girl who loves to play with her people and dog friends. She is now starting to explore new places on foot, and is ok with short car rides, long car trips are not good. Lexi has great house manners is crate trained and can relax hanging out. Lexi will blossom with a confident and experienced handler. We are looking for a home with a woman and no children. She has been afraid of most men but not all \u2013 so it all depends on how she feels about you if you are male. Her timid yet loving personality is contagious and everyone who patiently takes the time to meet her, falls in love. She is looking for a strong and competent companion who will guide and support her to build up her confidence. We are recommending at least one visit with her at her foster home where she is most comfortable. If all goes well, we will bring her to your home.\n\nPlease visit our website at http://www.gsror.com/adoptionapp/ to complete an online application.",

Some one got him as a puppy and just left him in a back yard for years until they took him to the shelter. It took him a week to let Tanya touch him and accept her. Once he did she could do anything with him. He is high anxity when around other dogs and will need someone who will give him the time to adjust. He is not food aggressive and does know sit and shake. He likes to jump up and give hugs once he trusts you as well.The first step in adopting an animal is to fill out the application. For an application please see our website www.tanyasinc.org and download an application and e-mail it to us. All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, dewormed, and are treated with advantix for fleas and ticks. They are also micro chipped(transfer of registration to your name is $20.00). With every adoption you will also receive coupons from PETCO.The best way to get ahold of us is to e-mail Tanya at tanyasinc@msn.com 1/23/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "Medical notes:  I am positive for Lyme and Ehrlichia. I will need to be on 28 days of doxycycline (an antibiotic). I will need a grain and potato free, fish-based food.\n\nOne fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, and now the BEST Fish\u2026 Thats ME!! I am 5 years old and 40 lbs of cuteness! (I am very energetic for an older guy.)\n \nAre you looking for a snuggle buddy? A walking buddy? A playmate for another dog? I am your guy! I do it all - some I do a little better than others, but I can learn! Just give me a little time to get used to my new home. \n\nI am a really easy dog and super sweet. I like being outside and will stand at the door until you let me out even if I just came inside, but when I am tired out I will happily crash on any soft spot. I love finding and lounging in a sunny patch in the yard. I can use the doggy door like a pro and have no interest in jumping any fences even if deer are on the other side. I love walks, but I recommend you get an easy walk harness for me so I can learn to be a better walker and not just move move move. \n \nIf you pay attention to me, I have perfect potty manners. I do believe I would be good for a family with another dog and fenced in yard because of my love for playing and the being outside! That is not to say that I can\u2019t be an only dog, but I might look bored or lonely, so you might have to entertain me a bit. I can be mouthy and may grab your hand or arm during rough/excited play. I DO NOT bite down or break the skin, but to a young child, I could be startling. I easily correct and you can move my attention onto a toy.\n\nI don\u2019t really play catch, but I like squeaky toys. When I am not playing or spending time outside I love to sleep and snuggle right up with you on the couch or on my dog bed. I love to wrestle with my big doggy friends that currently live with me. We will play for HOURS and then fall asleep inside or outside. I will happily play with my tiny dog friends, but I can forget how big I am and can be a bit rough, so we only play fully supervised. There is no aggression - just lots of paws, chasing and jumping. \n\nI love mealtime and am a big fan of the smoked duck feet from Dog Krazy! Although I am very food driven, I behave in the kitchen if I am not left alone. There are just so many good smells up on the counter I might be tempted to investigate when you are not looking. I will not bother you during your dinnertime.  \n\nI am GREAT in a crate and sleep there all night without a peep! Night can be scary to me. If I am startled awake I have been known to bite. So for everyone\u2019s safety, my forever family needs to be willing to let me sleep in the crate at night. Please respect my need for space at night, while I am not proud, I did bite the son and Dad in my last home at night.\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website!\n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog).

Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization.

My adopters will receive a FREE virtual consultation with my adoption, and 10% off any additional training packages!**\n\nHi, I'm Seiva!\n\nDo you like other dogs? I do not like dogs and cannot be around them\n\nWhat do you think about cats? I have a high prey drive and should not live with cats\n\nSo how do you feel about kids? I can be pretty nervous with new people and should live with teenagers and older\n\nWhat's your energy level like? About medium\n\nIs there anything else we should know about you? I'm about 7 years old, and I weigh between 55-65 lbs. I have a behavior and medical waiver staff would be happy to discuss over the phone.\n\nI came into the shelter as a surrender and the above information is all recommendations based on my previous history and the behavior seen at the shelter. Expect to learn more about me after adoption.\n\nIt is unknown how this animal will do in their new home as all animals can be different with each person. It is important to take this into consideration when thinking about adopting and making sure you are prepared to work with any potential medical or behavior issues that occur after adoption.\n\nMy adoption fee includes my spay/neuter, current vaccinations, permanent microchip identification, certificate for a free veterinary exam, post-adoption support and more!\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! If you think we would be a good match call and ask about me! I'm looking for my forever home and it could be with you!\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION: If you live in the city of Eugene or in Lane County you will be purchasing a dog license in addition to the adoption fee. You will get to choose between a one year, two year, or three year license.\nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503.

I like to play and I like other dog friends, too! I do not like cats much but other than that...I'm not too picky!\n\nI'm on the hunt for my forever home. I hope it has someone that can give me lots of love, and likes to play and take walks. I was feeling really bad before, but this rescue stuff is amazing and I'm feeling so much better! They say I would probably do well with kids, and maybe other dogs too, I just need a meet n greet to be sure. Could you be my forever home?\n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member",

Shorty was rescued by a rescue organization on the streets of Woodland Hills. They were never able to find his owner. Unfortunately they had to shut down and  Paw Parent stepped in and welcomed Shorty.  Shorty has been looking for a home for quite some time as he was found at only about 2 years old.  This sweet guy deserves a great home.\n\n He loves all people, but should be placed in a home with older children due to his strength. He has met a couple dogs he liked, but can be very selective. He loves to go on walks and absolutely loves to carry his ball around in his mouth. Shorty is a silly guy, and loves to play.  \n\nShorty is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all routine vaccinations. If you would like more information or would like to meet Shorty please contact Paw parent 661-724-0642 pawparent@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "Carmen is a Chihuahua, born in March, 2012. When she was about 3-years old, Carmen lost partial sight in both eyes. In spite of that, she loves playing fetch and tug, and she loves going for walks. Due to barking when left alone, she would not do well in an apartment. Unfortunately, Carmen's timidness along with unwelcomed touch of a toddler caused her to snap (but not bite). For this reason, there should be no young children in her new home. Carmen needs a home with an owner who can be patient with her as she adjusts to her lack of eyesight. Experience with blind dogs is preferred.\n\nCarmen also does great with both gentle dogs and cats! She loves to snuggle with her dog friends and is often found playing with the kitties!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Carmen is $200. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Peyton ton is best placed into a mature (no small children) household with no other animals. He's the whole deal - so he doesn't want to share attention. Peyton does have a few manageable medical concerns that the rescue is happy to speak to you about prior to filling out an application. If you have a sincere interest in adopting please email the rescue and we're happy to speak to you. \n\nPeyton is vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative. He will go home with pet insurance. \n\nIf you would like to apply to adopt Peyton, please visit our website to apply. www.hillhounds.org   If you fill out an app on another website - the information does not arrive at our rescue. Please refer to the bio before emailing the rescue for information. If you see a pup - we are accepting applications on them. You must have an approved application on file to visit or set up a meet n' greet. We are open by appointment only.",

            "description": "Happy puppy\nHanna is a 7 months old black lab/blue heeler mix puppy girl.\n\nHanna's story is sadly pretty typical for a rescue puppy. She was found on the streets of Dallas on her own. Animal control picked her up and sent out a call for rescue. She arrived at our rescue with terrible mange and malnourished\n, just a puppy at 3 months of age. Her face was crusted with skin infection and missing fur. Despite all these things, she was a sweet, playful and happy puppy. Her story will have a happy ending though. She currently lives in a foster home with other dogs and one cat. She is too playful for cats, so not recommended unless a cat has dog management experience. Hanna has a playful and loyal personality. She is up for anything as long as it's with her \"pack\". Her retriever genes show through fetching, she can fetch forever :) She likes to go for car rides that take her to Home Depot, Petsmart, a dog park or a park for a walk - part of her socialization routine. Hanna has started going to Camp Bow Wow doggie daycare, and she loves her new friends. Hanna is looking for her furever home with active family and hopefully a doggie sibling.\n\nHanna has a soft black fur with white trim on her chest and paws. Hanna is potty trained and crate trained. Hanna is fully vetted. She will grow to be a large size dog.\n\n*REQUIRES A YARD* *Children 10 y/o +*\n\nAt this age a puppy requires patience, supervision and training to become the best pup she can be. We are requesting a donation of $275 for her adoption which includes spaying, three round of puppy vaccines, a rabies vaccine, and microchip with registration, dewormer and a single dose of heartworm/flea prevention. If you're interested in meeting or adopting her, please complete an application on our website and someone will reach out to you within 48 hours. https://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/\n\nAGE: 7 months WEIGHT: 50 lbs (current), 60-80 lbs (full grown)\n\nWe do not have a facility to house the dogs in our program. They are all kept in foster homes until they are adopted. Therefore, if you are interested in adopting from LHS, please complete an online application at http://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/ and we will contact you asap about the status of your application.",

The shelter says she has the normal \"old girl\" issues - we will know more once she gets into rescue.\n\nOur cockers are NOT in a shelter, but in private foster homes, in and around the Columbus OH area.\n\nInformation on our dogs (personality, age, weight, etc.), details on our adoption process, adoption fees and the online application can be found on the homepage of our website at www.columbuscockerrescue.org. The frequently asked questions (faq) area should answer questions you have about the adoption process.\n \nIf you have questions after looking at our website, please click on the lavender box to send an email to us about this particular cocker.

We will go through our line to set up a private meet and greet for potential adopters to foster.\n307-739-1881\nadopt@animaladoptioncenter.org\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/42994530730154\n\nKitKat - 3 year old, male, Mixed breed, 38 lbs, \n\nKitKat is medium, mixed breed dog that is learning how to dog! He came from an overcrowded shelter in Texas and he has been getting spoiled with his fosters here in Jackson. KitKat is working on a few things. He thrives when he has consistency and he prefers to have proper meet and greets to other dogs. Once properly introduced, KitKat will play ALL DAY LONG! As soon as he can trust another dog they are best friends. He needs an active home where he can get proper, daily exercise and where he can be in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, no cats! We are working on his training as he gets a little too excited when he starts to play! He will make a great companion for someone as long as they continue on his training plan!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.\n\nPlease know that our intention is to insure long lasting committed homes for the animals at the AAC. If we feel that an animal and a potential owner are not a good fit we reserve the right to refuse adoption.",

            "description": "About Leo:  Leo was pulled from a backyard where he was tied. There were kids in the family, But, we are thinking he's been abused so NO CHILDREN are recommended. He is very fearful and mistrusting at this point so only cocker savy adopters will be considered. When Leo arrived he was fairly good with most of the vet staff if they went slow and didn't \"ask anything\" of him. Exam was tenuous and very limited so the full exam was done while under for his neuter. He seems to like other dogs although we've not had him off leash yet. Only cocker savy adopters will be considered - a fenced yard is required.Leo is selective in who he likes - seems to be mostly men. Again, ONLY EXPERIENCED adopters will be considered !!!!!! \n\nOur cockers are NOT in a shelter, but in private foster homes, in and around the Columbus OH area.\n\nInformation on our dogs (personality, age, weight, etc.), details on our adoption process, adoption fees and the online application can be found on the homepage of our website at www.columbuscockerrescue.org. The frequently asked questions (faq) area should answer questions you have about the adoption process.\n \nIf you have questions after looking at our website, please click on the lavender box to send an email to us about this particular cocker. Or, email us directly at adoption@columbuscockerrescue.org.",

He has been in the care of our amazing staff for a few weeks decompressing and is now relaxed and doing well. We would love to see him in a home where he can trust and be loved. We will update this information as we learn more about this handsome boy.\n\nJacques recently went on a field trip with one of our volunteers and this is what she said: \n\nThis guy is one of the best!\n\nThis is what I know. He is super sweet, loves to cuddle, rides well in the car and was kind with the people we met. He is strong but doesn't pull too much. He doesn't know a lot of commands but gentle and easy. He was friendly and well adjusted with the vet tech. She only had praise for him. This is a great dog!",

We may cancel our home visits as well but if you could attach photos of your yard and one or two of your home that would be great.

I would love a home that is active and likes to play.  I love squeaky toys and playing keep away.  I will give them up though if you really want them.  I would be best with older kids, as young ones may get knocked over by me.  I know the commands sit, stay, come and shake.  I am super smart so I know if you take the time with me, I can learn lots more.  I am sort of dog selective right now.  That means I might like some and not others.  I met a cat, and seemed unsure, so would probably take some work in the home.  Lots of baby steps to get us to like each other \n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

Very gentle dog. \nShe needs a family with a fenced yard and time to take care of her. (Mandatory) She is healthy, all up to date on vaccines, spayed and microchipped.\nStar is not fully housebroken yet, still has accidents in the house.\n\n To adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 30 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.

She will gladly throw a paw on you to let you know she wants pets, or she loves to give you a wet nose kiss. She will tag along on any of your daily routines at the house. Hera would make a great buddy to watch Netflix and nap with! For the most part Hera is low energy, but she gets the occasional zoomies! She is such a great dog to go on walks with. She is not one to pull on the leash, because she is just happy to be out with her person! She also understands some basic commands like 'stay, 'sit, and 'come. She has not made any new dog or cat friends yet, but seems eager to meet other dogs on walks. Hera is looking for humans who are around a good amount during the day, and who will be affectionate. She does best in a crate when left alone. Hera has tested positive for Heartworm, but she will be getting treated, and after a few weeks of rest, she will be the belle of the ball. This nugget of joy is looking for her person full of dipping sauce love! She can't wait to meet you and show you her sweet personality. Come meet Hera, she'd love to be your Netflix pal.",

Despite her scars and signs of abuse, she is fantastic with humans and seems OK with all the dogs here. Not 100% trusting of them, but definitely not looking to start anything either.

ADR is not responsible for the health, temperament, behavior or placement of this dog. Listings are done at the request of the dog's owner and as an outreach and community service in hopes of finding these dogs a loving, stable forever home. Placement decisions are made solely at the discretion of the owner and not Austin Dog Rescue. Owners are required to ask for an adoption fee from adopters.\n\nThis is the information that we received from Lyla's current foster:\n\nLyla's owner can no longer keep her with his job and landlord restrictions, so I am looking to re-home her. I am fostering her while we find her a home.\n\nThis sweet girl is looking for a new home. Lyla is a 7-year-old, 75-pound German Shepherd. She is spayed and micro-chipped. She absolutely loves butt scratches and belly rubs. She\u2019s been the best WFH partner throughout the pandemic! \n\nI would not recommend she go to a home with children or small dogs. She plays well with my more submissive Pitt Bull, but she can get aggressive when feeling territorial, especially with toys. She\u2019s also very protective of her home, so she needs someone who understands her fears and can soothe her appropriately. \n\nShe has TONS of energy, and would be best placed with someone who is very active for runs, walks, and lots of fetch. This girl can run all day!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this super intelligent cutie, please contact Genivieve at: genivieve.glynn@gmail.com",

Naturally they were all adopted into wonderful homes just as soon as they were old enough to leave her. But finding the perfect family for Heidi has been a lot more challenging. \n\nGiven her past, its not hard to imagine that Heidi was petrified of humans when she was rescued. Thanks to her incredibly patient foster family, she has slowly opened up over the last year and is finally learning to trust that not all humans are mean and has infact come to love her temporary family!\n\nHeidi is definitely an inside dog, however she does still largely prefer to spend the majority of her time outside, if she is able so a fenced in yard will be a necessary requirement of her adopter, as well as a patient, calm and understanding demeanor, \n\nShe desperately needs to find that one person who can complete the final phases in healing her broken spirit and capture her guarded heart!",

He came to us in a pretty sad state of neglect with matted fur, double ear infections, and swollen and sore eyes. His current foster parents have showered him with love and diligent care to provide relief for his eyes, but unfortunately circumstances have changed and we now need to find a new foster home to help him finish the road to a pain free and healthy life! \n\nKenobi is such a sweet and affectionate boy, and he's doing so well getting around in his halo for blind dogs. He just needs somewhere to crash so he can recover from his upcoming knee surgery. He requires daily eye meds and is an exemplary patient for his caregivers. Contact us today if you have a quiet spot in your home for Kenobi to recover from his knee repairs so he can find his loving forever family!\n\n\nSouthern California adopters only please!\n(San Diego area preferred)\n\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/waggingdogrescue/photos_albums\n\nAdoption Application: \nhttps://waggingdog.org/adopt/\n\nWebsite: https://waggingdog.org\nEmail: adoptions@waggingdog.org",

He is a handsome boy who has lots of energy. He loves to romp and play in the yard and loves toys. He needs further obedience training but is doing well thus far. We are working on leash manners but he does still pull if he sees something if interest. Dexter is unsure of other dogs and therefore he would do best as an ONLY pet. Older children are fine but he is too rough for little ones. Dexter needs a home with a physical fence an owner with breed experience and someone who can keep him active both physically and mentally. If you have what Dexter needs please complete the online adoption application at www.DelawareRescue.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please read the information here and then complete our online adoption application. One of our volunteers will contact you once the application has been processed.

Named after the emperor in a recent Disney film, he can be a sweetie - but he also likes getting his own way. An experienced home, willing to set limits and invest in training is a must for this boy.\n\nHe has just completed an obedience training session and will happily show you all that he has learned. He follows commands and has been well socialized with other dogs and people. He lives in a GSROC foster home and gets along well with the medium and large dogs there.\n\nHe will thrive in an experienced home that enjoys the typical GSD personality and will provide him with the structure and training he craves.\n\nHe will do best in an adult home or one with older children. This is not the puppy for families with small kids. He is only 7 months old and filled with puppy energy. Sometimes his exuberance gets the best of him that is why we recommend a home with older children. He is active, likes to explore and have a good time. Sitting around as a couch potato is something Kuczo would never dream of doing.\n\nOnce Kozco trusts and respects you he will follow the rules, and loves to cuddle with his people. And then he will be ready to get up, get moving and have fun again.\n\nPlease remember, adopting a puppy is not everyone's cup of tea. As cute as they are - puppies demand a large investment of time, patience, and training. They are inquisitive, have endless energy and get into just about everything. They dig, chew, and seemingly never stop! Think long and hard about your lifestyle.\n\nIf you are not willing to invest the time and training to ensure your puppy matures into the wonderful dog - then please consider an older dog.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

She epitomizes the ultimate diva from her sassy yet sweet demeanor to the classy and sophisticated way she behaves and draws humans into her heart. She is stunning to look at from her glossy silver coat to her doe like Bambi eyes...Miss Goddess is a Bombshell Pup! \n\nSo its only natural that she would prefer that her family reserve ALL of the attention and \"animal love\" for her and her alone! As much as she adores humans, Goddess does not get along well with any other animals. \n\nShe doesn't mind sharing her parents with human siblings (since they will surely become instantly enamored with her as well and only serve to offer her MORE love, attention, belly rubs and did we mention, more attention!?) \n\nPlus she LOVES to play, especially outside and kids are usually really eager to join her there, too!  Even if she cant find anyone to romp around with when she is outside, Goddess also really enjoys sunbathing and relaxing in the warm rays! \n\nShe has an enormous heart and wants to be cuddled and loved as much as she possibly can! Whatever makes Goddess the center of attention is right up her alley but she is also perfectly satisfied to lounge around and nap at her people's feet if they're home and she will patiently be waiting to greet them with bells on, when she has to be left home alone. \n\nGoddess truly is an exceptional girl and she is just waiting to find the perfect family to appreciate her in all of her glory! \n\n",

            "description": "Sam has by far taken my heart he's such an incredible dog! I'm having a hard time giving him up but I know he will find the love he needs with another family. Sam is a big baby and is so incredibly gentle he DOSEN'T have one mean bone in him. He gets along with my two cats and 3 large dogs, but his favorite bud is my little bull terrier. They really love each other so much so I would really like for him to be in a home with another dog! He definitely deserves to have a buddy. Sam is very energetic, so he will need someone who likes to go on runs and adventures and will be willing to take him along. A family with kids that can keep him busy would be great too! I like to say he has an old soul. Once he builds a connection with you, the love he offers is out of this world. Its breaks my heart to even think someone dropped him off on the streets because they no longer wanted him. Sam is fully housetrained and has had no accidents since in my care. He does come with a gnarly scar on his knee from the knee surgery we had to do because he got hit by a car. He still favors it a tad, but its fully works. You can grab it and it doesn't bother him one bit. Sam really is an all around perfect dog. Sam is a great protector and he knows when someone's at the door without them even knocking and he lets me know immediately. I will say hes a bulldozer and will plop his big self in your lap like he's a lap dog. I just really hope whomever is truly interested takes in to consideration what I asked above for Sammy. If Sam sounds like a match, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

While she thoroughly enjoys making friends with new dogs, her over the top and in your face attitude is a bit much for most other dogs at first. However, if all the dogs are given time and plenty of space to get to know each other on their own terms, most dogs end up playing nicely with Willa after all is said and done.",

So she could truly be a lovely addition to most any home! \n\nShe is house trained and crate trained and already knows some basic commands as well! \n\nWhile Kita does love to romp and play and of course, swoons over a chance at a nice long walk or play date outside,,,she also really loves to snuggle up with her people or a furry sibling and enjoy a nice naptime, day or night! \n\nAs you can see in the before/after photo that's included in her bio, Kita's transformation truly illustrates what rescue is all about. After being graciously spared from a bleak existence of severe neglect, she has truly blossomed into the very idea of what a happy and well adjusted dog should be!! As a rescuer, being able to bridge the gap between a traumatic past and future with limitless possibility is one of life's greatest blessings!  \n\nAfter having already been with her rescue for over a year, with very little interest at all, Kita's dream come true would be for her to find a family of her very own to love her as much as she will love them!",

            "description": "New to OCDRT from a shelter in PA\n\nBella is being fostered in Columbus\n\nBella is around a year old & entered the shelter with a very large wound & tested positive for 2 tick born diseases. She was under a lengthy quarantine and started showing distress like an ACD does with lack of exercise, so OCDRT was asked to take her in. She will be retested with OCDRT's vet before she is released for adoption.\n\nBella does not seem to know what a house is & has been indifferent to the other dogs, however she is starting to play with them. She met the resident cat and does well with him. She will learn all about crate training, socialization with other dogs & cats, basic obedience, foundation skills, & have her vetting completed. Bella will require an ACD savvy home. Please check back for updates as we learn what type of home Bella will require.\n\nUPDATE 10/1/2020: Bella has been with us for less than two weeks, and has made great progress. She is doing well with house breaking,  crate training and crates herself.  Bella has developed some fundamental manners interacting with her foster humans, and foster sisters.  She no longer is afraid of the kitchen appliances.  We now can walk through a doorway to go outside without bolting through the door.  Bella is typical cattle dog smart.  She walks well on a leash, heels (most of the time), knows sit, leave it (the cat), no, easy (taking treats), and we are working on down, and her recall.  Bella prefers women and doesn't interact much with men. Due to her past a fenced in yard is preferred and ACD experience is required. \n\nUpdate 10/25/2020: We had some tests completed at our vet for the tick born diseases, Bella is not symptomatic & tested negative for her PCR so she has been cleared and is not in need of any treatments. She is learning to like attention from her Foster Dad & is doing wonderful with her ACD & cat siblings \n\nOur website with additional information can be found at: http://www.ocdrescueteam.org/ \n\nIf you would like to sponsor a foster please go to http://www.ocdrescueteam.org/donate we also appreciate donations towards a fosters excessive medical expenses.  \n\nPLEASE READ ALL INFORMATION BELOW - THANK YOU! \n\nOur adoption fee of $250, goes towards the rescues spaying/neutering, vaccinations, microchip, fecal testing, de-worming, heartworm/tick disease testing and treatment/preventative, any other medical needs are addressed, and all fosters are fed a premium food. Thank You for considering a rescue, that comes to you with all of the routine medical done. \n\nIf interested please email info@ocdrescueteam.org for an adoption application. Please note a foster's needs before filling out an application. Our fosters are in our homes for at least 2 weeks before adoption. We learn their likes/dislikes and these concerns are noted in their bios. \n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is not a public shelter. This dog is being fostered in a private home until adoption. Prospective adopters who have submitted an accepted application and completed a telephone interview are welcome to schedule an appointment to travel to meet the dog. The dogs are adopted on first come, first serve basis. If approved for adoption, a deposit will hold the dog until a meeting is arranged at the fosters home.",

Idgie is learning to be a good leash walker and is 99.9% housetrained. :) Her ideal family would be active and interested in continuing to build on her training. \n\nHer foster mom says she is \"100% the sweetest most loving girl,\" but she needs someone who can understand and manage her prey drive and love her, quirks, and all.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested, and treated if necessary.

He is a determined little guy who will not let anything stand in his way!\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

She is also very smart and affectionate so when she isn't outside, she's thrilled to bond while learning new tricks (she already knows most basic commands), cuddle up for a nap with her person or stimulate her mind and other senses with enrichment activities!\n\nShe will be best suited to a home with older children who will take her on a hike or let her tag along with them on an outing, rather than smaller ones who may be too excited and make her nervous.  \n\nWhile she does play quite nicely with some other dogs, she is selective when choosing her canine companions so a meet and greet will be needed to determine whether or not she could join an already established pack or not.",

            "description": "Dizzy is one big, happy boy! He weighs in at 65 pounds and we think he is 1-2 years old. He came to us as a transfer from another shelter so unfortunately we have no real history. We did hear that he got into scuffles with other male dogs although since being here at HAL we have not had any issues thus far. He can be selective with males but is currently in a play group with two other male dogs. However we still believe he would do best in a home with another female dog. Dizzy is very friendly, out-going and treat-motivated. He walks well on leash and keeps his kennel clean here. He loves to play ball and with rope toys. He would make a very affectionate, loyal companion and is very tolerant. He would NOT be a dog park dog due to being selective of male dogs in his space. He would be happy in a home where he could play for hours with his people in a fenced back yard.  Long walks would be best if they were not in crowded places, so city life could be problematic. This handsome boy wants to be close to his people and that's what really makes him happy. We recommend that he goes to a home with older kiddos only 10+ since he really does not know his own strength or size. No kitties, please.  Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match.\nHis adoption fee of $175.00 includes neuter, current vaccines, microchip, vet visit, offer of pet health insurance, and engraved ID tag.\n\n**ADOPTIONS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY WITH AN APPROVED ADOPTION APPLICATION. Please see our website for our adoption application at\n\nhttps://homeatlasths.org/dog-adoption-application/\n\nand information on the adoption process\n",

            "description": "Our sweet Remo. This handsome fellow has come a LONG way. He came to us from a shelter in Atlanta, GA having HUGE holes in is shoulders and thighs. He was severely malnourished. He came to Hard Knocks, and after a little TLC and an amazing foster, Remo has learned to walk, run, play, and trust. Remo LOVES to play ball......like.....really loves to play ball. That's all he thinks about day and night. He has to have a tennis ball with him at all times. \n\nIts so hard to describe sweet Remo digitally. He truly is such a good boy who has been through so much. His perfect home would have to be with someone who is understanding, patient, and respectful of all the trauma Remo has experienced.\n\n\nThank you so much for your inquiry. Our sweet Hard Knocker is currently available for adoption. Our process in adopting out our dogs begins with an adoption application. Please complete this form on our website using the following link, https://www.hkrtinc.com/adoption-form. \n\nOnce you have submitted your application, please allow up to 72 hours for a response. Once approved, you will be contacted to set up a meet and greet. Submitting an application does not guarantee an adoption. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis. We want our dogs to find the perfect home. We also want to do our best to find the perfect matched dog for your home. \n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the pup you have inquired about, please feel free to email directly to hkrtrescue@gmail.com.\n\n\nThank you so much for your support and for helping us #dowhatsrightnotwhatseasy.",
