She's a calm and easy-going girl at just needs a couch to rest on. She loves hanging out in the play yard and going on walks with her fur-sibling, Zoey. Maya is still adjusting to life at Alaqua, and it's taking her some time to fully decompress and let her personality truly shine. \n\nMaya's ideal home is a relaxed environment where she can be spoiled like the princess she is. She needs a family that has lots of patience and will take the time to help her come out of her shell and gain confidence. She would benefit going home with her fur-sibling, Zoey, or having another dog in the home that can help her quickly become comfortable. As long as the other fur sibling is not a cat; she has lived with one before and prefers dog siblings only. Maya can't wait to meet you and find her forever home!",

All AAA dogs are up to date on all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. \n\nDogs are individuals -- The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs.

He has a history of being abused by previous owners so it takes him a little to open up. He has a tendency to bark at people he doesn't know, usually he wags his tail when barking because he's excited for the attention but unsure about the person. He has no bite history and has been around children before with no problems. He has been around large dogs before but has never been around small dogs. He hasn't had any direct contact with cats so he has no experience being around them alone but also hasn't shown any aggression towards a cat. He's capable of adapting with a TLC and warms up with a little love and care. He appears to be in good health but has a small lipoma on his belly. He's had a hard life and needs a good home that will give him lots of love and make the rest of his life a happy one.  If you would like more information about Buddy, please contact Bonnie at purplecookiex@aol.com.",

I don't need much to keep me happy - mostly I'm searching for a faithful companion who makes sure that I get to tag along in all their adventures with them. I get kinda nervous sometimes when people move too fast so I prefer people who know how to respect me and take their time. I came in as a stray, but no one came to reclaim me, so now I'm available for adoption! Do you think you might be my next best friend???",

This little guy has not had a very good start in life as we found him homeless and living on the streets of Texas with his Momma and siblings at just a few weeks old. We busted Bitzy out of that life and now he is on a path to a happy, safe life with his forever family. But we have to find Bitzy's forever family first! Bitzy is a happy, playful, sweet, loving pup.

Don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t slow him down! \n\nPlease read all about Cyrus (below) and if you feel you are a good match for him and want to meet him, please complete an application found on our website, we will be adopting Cyrus into the Portland area. Videos of him are in the comments. www.mywayhomedogrescue.org\n\nCyrus is a mellow guy but always wakes up excited to greet each day! Once he zooms around the yard he is a great leash walker with minimal pull (front clip harness works great too). Due to his surgery he has spent a lot of crate time and has no problem coming in after a walk to head for his crate for a nap with his pillow. \n\nCryus is house trained and no matter the circumstance has never had an accident in the house. He will whine to let you know he needs to go outside. He is not much of a barker, likes people and other dogs. He is not a dog park dog. His injury is healing and he would not feel comfortable being tossed into a dog park. Cyrus will chase cats and small animals- no cats for this boy.\n\nHis perfect home would have a person to continue his training (he has come so far). He needs a secure yard to do his zoomies. He doesn\u2019t mind being left at home if you need to go out. He loves car rides. He would be fine as an only dog but has found comfort with his foster brothers and sisters. He is a funny guy, he gets excited to go out and is just as excited to come back in. We think he is a couch potato that does zoomies. \n\nCyrus has had his vaccinations, heart wormed tested, has been neutered, de-wormed, flea/tick treatment and microchipped.  His adoption fee is $350.\n\nMy Way Home adopts in the Portland metro area only.",

He is a great little boy who likes to talk. That is all he is doing but his talking is often mistaken for growling. That is how Rascal communicates. He loves to be petted and will growl the entire time you are petting. Stop and he moves closer all the while he is growling. He never bites but obviously the growling does take a little while to get used to. On a positive note, Rascal is a very social guy. He gets along well with all his foster brothers and sisters. He is even good with the foster kitties. He likes to run and play and hang out but he is truly about being next to you to be petted. Rascal walks well on a leash and likes to ride in the car. He is a great little guy. He just needs the right person to give him and chance and continue the love he has received from his foster mom. Rascal is neutered, current on all his shots and microchipped. To be considered for his forever family please contact Vivienne at viviennejames@comcast.net.

            "description": "Jemison is the sweetest and most beautiful boy weighing in at approximately 100lbs. He is estimated at 2 years old, and we think his name fits him perfectly because he is just a Jem (Gem)! He was rescued from the South Korean dog meat industry to give him a chance to live a normal dog life. Jemison is very puppy like in his play and enjoys his time out of kennel, showing off his favorite stuffed toys to anyone he sees. Although stuffed toys are his absolute favorite, he also enjoys busy bones, Nyla bones, Kongs, and rope toys (he is so talented...he can hold two toys at once!). His favorite part of the day is enrichment time! He is a social boy and is easily leashed, and walks well! Despite his size, he is a gentle giant, and takes treats so sweetly! Jemison would do best in a home without other dogs as he is still learning how to be appropriate with them. Our precious jemstone is looking to be the diamond of someone's heart, and is looking to find his forever home that will love every bit of his puppy love! Jemison is currently living at an offsite location. If you are interested in adding Jemison to your family, please fill out the application (https://bit.ly/2M27kgo) and submit it to rcorkrin@hswcmd.org. Your application will then be reviewed and you will be contacted if you and Jemison seem to be a good match to set up a meet and greet!",

My name is Monzie and I'm a big love dog!\n\nAnimal Allies of Texas rescued me and I'm living in a foster home with two teenage girls and a female Boston Terrier. I like running around in the backyard. I am 100% house-trained and I love sleeping on my dog bed. I don't chew on anything I'm not supposed to. I have some toys, and I'm learning how to play with them.\n\nI'm a smart boy, but I'm not an alpha dog. My foster parents are good at helping me overcome some fear issues... sometimes I flinch at sudden movements or loud noises. My foster Mom was a little worried about hosting a Pitbull, but now we're best friends and I follow her everywhere. I am extremely gentle and loving. There's nothing I like better than hugs and being close to people. I love giving kisses and putting my head in your lap. I don't display any food aggression, people aggression or dog aggression. I haven't been around cats so I don't know ho I'd act around them. My foster family says I am very quiet and I never bark. I know how to shake hands and I respond well to treats and positive reinforcement.\n\nI do well in the car. I have a crate, but my foster family trusts me when they leave for short periods so they let me stay out. Mostly I like to lounge around on my bed or my blankie. If you let dogs on the couch I am totally on board, although my foster family is teaching me not to get on the people furniture. I do well on the leash and enjoy walking around the neighborhood or at the park.\n\nMy foster family says my fur is super-soft and I hardly shed. They also say I have a big head and big feet. I guess they match the size of my heart! They think I would be an incredible companion dog for the right person or family. I really am a big, goofy, lazy lapdog who just needs lots of love.\n\nThe only thing I need to complete my perfect life is a forever home. If you would like to meet me please contact AAT (Animal Allies of Texas). I'd sure love to meet you!\n\nAnd if you would like to volunteer to same more lives and foster cats or dogs, please go to the Animal Allies of Texas website and inquire. It is wasn't for the kind lady who sprung me from the shelter, I would not be here to tell my story. AAT will educate you on what it takes to be a foster parent.",

            "description": "Meet ZEKE.  He is a young Lab-Pit mix and is a nice medium size. He walks fairly well on the leash. He is curious, but calm. He's a bit shy.  He isn't a ball of active energy & that\u2019s not a bad thing! He loves attention and will likely greet you at his kennel door to look at you with those soulful eyes of his. \n\nWe think he\u2019d adore being a pampered indoor companion who\u2019d love lots of snuggling.  He will need some basic training (as all dogs do), but I get the sense that he is a smart boy who will settle in with you and be eager to learn and please you. \n\nZEKE is sponsored!! That means his fully vetted adoption fee is only $50.   Come visit him Tuesday - Saturday 11AM - 3PM. No appointments necessary, but please bring your masks to wear indoors or outside if in close proximity to others.\n\n*****\nIf don't have room in your home but do have room in your heart, you can help one of our homeless pets find a home of its own by sponsoring them. By sponsoring, you will be paying part of the adoption fee, making it possible for them to be adopted much sooner. \n            \nFor Adoption or Sponsorship  Information please call 270-586-3125.  \nADOPTION HOURS:  Tuesday - Saturday 11 am to 3 pm Central Time. Adoption Fee for our dogs is $95.  All dogs will be adopted fully vetted.  Spay/Neuter.  Wormed.  Heartworm tested and heartworm preventative administered.   Upon adoption, monthly preventative medications are available at a discounted rate.\n",

He has mostly Brindle with white on his neck and chest.  He and his 2 sibling brothers, T-Bone and Tiger are looking for their forever homes.  Owners are now living in a place that they are over the limit with their dogs.  They are all loved so much.  Tiny is UTD on his vaccinations.\nTiny is the one that loves the deepest out of the 3!  He LOVES laps and is playful and loves to play fetch!  If you say, \u201cGo Tiny go\u201d, he will keep going in laps or circles.  He is leash trained and house trained.  He knows the commands sit (with the snapping of fingers), stay & lay.  He is an inside dog but loves to roam in his fenced in yard in the summer.  He is free fed.  He has been exposed to Boxers (large dogs) and other chihuahuas and does fine.  He will chase cats if they run from him and that has happened in outdoor settings only.  He has been around newborn to 8 years of age but Tiny seems to respond well to mature children.\nOwners would love to see this trio adopted together but knows that would be a unique situation.  They would just be happy knowing they were in a loving home. \nDoes Tiny sound like the buddy you have been looking for?\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

I came in as a stray a few days before Christmas. I was in bad shape, my ears were so swollen and infected. After receiving all the good medical care I needed, I am ready for adoption. I do need continued medication for my skin, which is looking amazing these days. I am a happy guy that walks great on leash and the cutest sight is when I get the zoomies. I am sensitive to some handling, mainly because I was in some pain when I came in and still can be unsure of certain handling. I also get a little grabby for my snacks and toys, so kids over 8 years old is best for me. I love toys, squeaky rubber balls especially! I will keep myself entertained and don\u2019t mind if you join in on the fun. I will need a feline free home. I am hard to redirect and I seem to want to chase the kitties. I did not mind the other dog I met here and I think I would do fine with a dog friend at home.\n\nMedical:  Rumple is currently receiving treatment for severe ear infections in both of his ears.  He received a long acting medication in both of his ears on 12/28.  This medication is waxy and yellow in color and will last for 30 days.\n\nDuring his time at HSHA, Rumple was found to suffer from chronic ear infections.  It is possible that he may develop more infections in the future.  Chronic ear infections can result in permanent changes to the ear canal that make them more prone to developing future infections.  Ear infections can be uncomfortable and require veterinary treatment.  Rumple should be seen as soon as possible by your regular veterinarian should he start to show signs of infection (ex: head shaking, scratching at ears, swollen ear flap, ear debris).  Your veterinarian may recommend diagnostic testing and surgical options.  \n",

My previous owner had some changes in their home environment and I was not happy at all with this change so even though it was a heart breaking decision  it was decided that it would be best for me to find a new home where I could be happy and feel safe. I am timid and shy but once I know you I am a very friendly and sweet boy. I am good with the other dogs here and do not mind the cat. I am crate trained and will let you know when I have to do my business outside. I am just the most adorable little guy looking for my happily ever home. You must be an experienced Chi person to apply for me. To apply go to the rescue's website www.flopra.org/adopt and fill out an application if you are selected, you will be contacted to discuss next steps. \nLooking forward to meeting my furever human! \nLove, \n\nTito xo",

            "description": "Trixie, female, 40 lbs, 4yrs,\n-must go to an adult only home as she is very clingy to her human Dad doesn't want to share him, gets along with her dog sibling, does well on walks but some dogs get her excited while other dogs she totally ignores, loves chasing squirrels, has medium level energy, she gets a long walk, sometimes jogging, in the mornings and then she plays with her housemate in the evening in the yard, doesn't play fetch so unless it's a walk or playing with our other dog she just watches the traffic out front or sleeps, she's pretty good on leash so would do well if someone wants to walk a lot for exercise,  I walk her and another 50+ lb dog with a baby in a stroller and have no problems controlling them, can be left home without crating, smart and food driven, content sleeping in a ball or watching us do different activities, gets excited and greets me when I get home, has a drive for food and will steal it from her house mate or even our daughter's hand, but isn't aggressive if you take her food away, is pretty good about going to her \"place\" and staying quietly, but I reinforce with food, so that helps considerably,  good about sticking around in the yard if the gate gets left open or she goes out to greet someone, but if a loud car or motorcycle drives by her instinct is to chase and bark so she'll bolt.  \nShe also loves to chase squirrels in the yard, but is pretty good about not chasing on a walk, unless the squirrels are chasing each other and chattering near her, then she gets excited. She isn't real \"snuggly\", but wants to always lay next to me or near me, will follow me to different rooms and lay nearby, definitely has a herding/shepherd mentality that she keeps an eye on things and lets others know she doesn't approve, an incredibly loud bark for her size. \n\n\nRequirements for Adoption:\nSorry but we only place our dogs in the Columbus area.  For rescues/shelters across Ohio, visit:  ColumbusDogConnection.com/RescuesShelters.html\nMust be over the age of 24 to adopt.\nYour resident pets must be spayed/neutered.\n\nAdoption Process:\nWe do not have an application. Adoptions are pet-adopter driven.\nTo meet our pets:\nCall our office at 614-471-9000 or click on the pet which you are interested in and send email. We will be happy to discuss the adoption process with you and set-up a visit at time of contact. The foster dogs are in foster homes and most of the cats reside at our office.\n\nThe adoption process includes a lease manager reference (if applicable) , a veterinarian reference, a home-visit (in-person or virtual).\nIf you've never owned a pet, part of our adoption process requires that you call several vet offices to compare services, prices, and availability. \nQuestions to ask include:\nHow many doctors are at your practice?\nCan I request to see a specific Vet or would I be scheduled with first available?\nWhat are your hours?\nHow much is:   annual exam, heartworm test & tablets, an x-ray,  vaccines, a non-emergency office call? \nDo you recommend vaccines every year or every three years?  (every 3 yrs as suggested by the AVMA)           \n\nThe pooches that visit your home will not be left there at the end of the visit. We take them back home with us so your family can discuss to ensure he/she is a good fit for your home.\n\nThere is an adoption agreement and adoption fees as follows:\n $300 for Adult Dogs (6yrs  & younger)\n $200 for Senior Dogs (7 yrs and older)\n $80 for Cats  \n\n All pets are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested (dogs), fiv/leukemia tested (cats), & micro-chipped.\nKnown medical conditions are discussed at time of inquiry.",

            "description": "Max is a special boy in need of a special home. Max was adopted from us 6 years ago as a puppy. Unfortunatly, Max's owner became very ill and was no longer able to care for him. Max was removed from his home and surrendered by extended family to animal control. He was brought back to us in hopes of finding him a new, loving, forever home. Max is understandably heartbroken and very confused. He wants nothing more then to be with someone at all times. He finds comfort in companionship and long walks. Max is very nervous being back at the shelter and does take some time to warm up to new people. Once he trusts you, he's a giant love bug. Max is overweight and will require a home with a family who can help him get back down to and maintain a healthy weight. This big boy is entering his golden years and deserves to spend them in the comfort of a new, quiet forever home. We are unsure of how Max is with other animals, but have been told he would prefer to be an only pet.\n\nTo view the adoptable dogs at our shelter, you must fill out an adoption application found on our website. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are showing dogs on an appointment only basis. Please understand that we are receiving a high volume of applications at this time and are doing our best to address as many as we can. Please be patient. Thank you.\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs is $250. Aside from the shelter, food and water, exercise and compassion they receive while in our care, this also includes veterinary services such as Rabies, Distemper+Lepto, Bordetella, H3N2/H3N8 Influenza, heartworm testing, fecal exams, preventions and deworming medications. Spays/Neuters are also included as part of the adoption fee as is microchipping. \nPuppies under the age of 6 months have an adoption fee of $350. The veterinary services rendered include puppies first round of vaccines, fecal exams, deworming medications, preventions, and microchipping. Our facility spays and neuters dogs at 6 months of age. If the puppy is adopted prior to his, or her prescheduled surgery date, a $200 spay/neuter deposit will be taken on the day of adoption. This deposit it refundable and will be returned to the adopter once proof of the procedure is returned to the shelter. \nCOVID-19 NOTE: Please understand that we are looking for forever home for our pets. We understand that many people have a lot of time on their hands during the COVID-19 pandemic, so this may seem like an ideal time to bring home a new pet. Please be sure you are prepared to give your new pet his, or her forever home once our lives go back to normal. They deserve it. Thank you and stay safe.",

Volunteers who answer email do not have information on specific dogs and will direct you to put in an application.  Thank you.\n\nBEAU and BELLA are a pair like no other, round, happy and fun to be around. This middle aged duo found themselves abandoned at Animal Control after their owner passed away and no family member was able to step up and take them in. We saw their tail wagging adorableness on a video and made sure these two were out of harm's way. Beau and Bella are sweet, and are definitely used to car rides and walks. They can stand to loose a few pounds (Bella more so than Beau). They can be adopted separately, but if anyone would like to adopt both, we would be overjoyed for them.\nBoth are around 6 years old, Beau weighs 55 lbs, and Bella is a very chunky overweight 70 lbs.  \nBella and Beau have been vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, heart worm tested negative and spayed/neutered.\nWe are asking for an adoption donation of $250 each dog or $350 for the pair.\n",

            "description": "This very handsome young boy is Jet and he is looking for a kind family to give him the life every dog deserves. We found out about Jet on Thanksgiving when a girl travelled to meet her boyfriend's family and she was told Jet was going to be euthanized. Kindly, she contacted rescue for help for him and we are so thankful she did. Jet was purchased as a puppy and left to roam. He was hit by a car and sadly both of his front legs were broken. A vet set them in splints and soon, Jet was able to walk again. His owners lost their home and one of them died so poor Jet was left tied to a tree, ignored and neglected with no shelter at all. All he could do was bark at people walking by, pleading for help. The owner's wife contacted a shelter to take him, but they were too full so they decided to have him euthanized instead. So Jet was able to come to rescue in the nick of time. Since Jet has arrived to rescue, he is a completely different dog! He is flourishing here, has made new friends and is doing so well. He is now fully vetted and ready for a new chapter in his life with a family who will never abandon him again. Jet may be a bit nervous trying new things, but he is doing well and is eager to learn. He would do great with an experienced family who knows the breed and can continue working with him. He'll need a fenced in yard and would do well with another canine companion to show him the ropes. While we are all so sorry Jet had such an awful start in life, we can\u2019t wait to see him happy in a great home of his own with a family who loves him - he deserves so much better than he has known so far!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

She has mastered the doggy door and loves her foster brother Rocky, 125lb shepherd, the MOST.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Penny is mostly a normal puppy... but has been classified with megaesophagus.  This is a condition in which the esophagus is wider than normal, and special feeding/limited diet is required. In Penny's case she eats with her paws up on a crate, which allows the food to pass easier by gravity.  A Bailey chair has been ordered and she will be trained to use it.  One thing that is helpful... Penny is open to everything we do to help her!  She's a wonderful puppy, a very smart girl, and learns quickly without stubbornness.  Penny is also a love, and she enjoys cuddling on laps or in arms.\n\nFor more information on her condition: http://caninemegaesophagusinfo.com/\n\nTo donate to her ongoing medical care and to purchase a Bailey chair, donations can be made through our main website: www.centralcoastspca.org",

I\u2019m part of the Northern Outreach Initiative here at Animal Services. I am a sweet boy who seems to being getting accustomed to the city life well. I\u2019m friendly towards people and other dogs too. I can\u2019t wait to play and go on new adventures with my family! I think I would be a great addition to almost any family, so please ask about me today!\n\nLeash: Needs to work on leash manners\nObedience: Needs training\nContainment: A fenced in yard\nWith other Dogs: Appears friendly\nWith cats: unknown\nWith small children: unknown\n\n\nAdoption comes with:\n\n* Mandatory spaying/neutering\n* First license\n* Veterinarian check-up\n* First vaccinations\n* Tattoo\n* Microchip implant\n* 6 weeks of free pet insurance\n* Small bag of dog food\n* De-worming for young pups\n * Literature on responsible pet ownership.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n** IMPORTANT NOTICE **\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, dog adoptions are currently being done by appointment only. Contact 311 to schedule an appointment. Thank you!\n\n______________________________\n\nCome Meet Our Adoptable Dogs...\nWinnipeg Animal Services Agency\n1057 Logan Avenue\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nR3E 3N8\n\nPhone: 311 - outside Winnipeg dial 1-877-311-4974 \n\nEmail: animalservicesagency@winnipeg.ca\n\nOur hours for adoption are Monday to Friday from 11:00 am - 5:30 pm\nSaturday & Sunday from 12:00 pm - 4:30pm.\nAnimal Services is closed on statutory holidays.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAlmost all the dogs at Animal Services are picked up as strays running loose on the streets of Winnipeg and therefore they come to us with no known history. For this reason, we are not sure how they will interact with other dogs, cats or how they are with children. We would suggest that if you have younger children you bring them down with you to meet the dogs. We also have an outdoor play area where we can do introductions with any other dogs that live in the home.\n\nAll locally adopted dogs come with a 7 day home trial. If you return the dog within this time period, you will be refunded your adoption fee less the non-refundable deposit.\n\nPlease feel free to meet all the dogs and puppies outside of their kennels, just let the kennel attendants know that you would like a meet and greet with the dog outside of his pen. The dogs are much more relaxed when outside of their kennels. They would love to meet you!",

Take your time answering the questions -- rushing to submit before another applicant does not increase your chances of being chosen.***\n\nName: Wilbur\nNicknames: Wilby. Porky. Silly butt. Snuggle butt. Willllllbur.\nBreed: Olde English Bulldog\nAge: 2 Years\nSex: Male\nWeight: 50 lbs. \nBefore OMD: Surrendered to us by his owner due to significant life changes. \nEnergy Level: Medium-high. He isn\u2019t your stereotypical couch potato Bulldog. He loves to sleep but he\u2019s also all about his walks and zoomies.\nSmart Cookie Level: He knows sit and he\u2019s happy to give his paw but to be honest, he's no Einstein when it comes to most things.\nSnore Level: Get your earplugs ready... \nAffection Level: Extreme. 100% velcro dog who loves to love and be loved.\nDescriptors: Friendly. Stubborn. Exuberant. Affectionate. Demanding. High maintenance.\nBest features: His perfectly compact meatball physique. His smooshable face and jowls. \nWhat we love most: He makes you feel like the most important person in the world. He is always up for a snuggle marathon. He prefers to nap with his head in your lap. He smiles.\nWhat makes us laugh: His high-speed paw offering if he thinks there\u2019s a treat to be had.\nWhat he loves most: Tie. His human and the bag of snackies on the table.\nWhat else he loves: Attention. Bully sticks. Adventures. Marrow bones. Car rides. Watching the world go by from the car window. His blue football squeaky toy, which no longer squeaks, for the record. \nWorking on: Embracing and enjoying his alone time. Jumping when excited. Begging. Hoovering food and treats.\nGotta be honest: He pulls like an ox (let's not forget he has a low center of gravity, meaty neck, and muscles for days) and sounds like a screaming pterodactyl-gremlin when he sees another dog on leash. #workinprogress #yesitisthatbad\nDogs: Nope. Way too overstimulated when he sees other dogs and his common sense goes out the window. \nCats: Another no. \nKids: Yes, but 10+ as he will knock a little one down when he\u2019s excited.\nHouse trained: Yep!\nWanted: Bully-savvy family in search of a co-pilot for daily adventures. Should be attentive and patient and equally dedicated to continued leash training and lengthy cuddle sessions. Appreciation for snoring and love of snacks and sharing the couch are a must.\nWilbur is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative and microchipped.

We are unsure of her background, but ended up in the shelter and her bright blue eyes won her a trip up to MN. Her perfect forever home would have humans that are active, as she is ready for hiking, snowshoeing, walking or running. She could take or leave another dog friend in the home, but she doesn\u2019t like other dogs that are super up in her face. I mean, what dignified girl does? She will chase cats, so a no kitty home is best. Being that she is a husky, and huskies can be quite vocal, she will not be placed in an apartment/shared wall setting. Looking for your next activity buddy, Iris arrives on 2/6 and would love her new owners to pick her up that day. All adoptions have a two week trial period to ensure she is a good fit. \n\nRequirements: Home with yard space. No shared walls. No cats\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104540557144\n\nYou can email laurahhk9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n\n",

They are looking for a furrever home together. They are spayed, current on vaccinations, and microchipped. They need a home with a secure fenced in yard. Hounds have lots of energy. They will attempt to chase any squirrel they see, so someone who knows how to continue with leash discipline would be best. If you are interested in learning more about Fawn and Halle or the adoption process you can call or text Heather at 423.618.6464. \n",

Whatever he is we do know he is simply adorable!!!!\n\nWalter is super sweet, super loving, super snuggly, and just an all around great little dog. He hates the crate and tries to get out but settles down eventually. He'd rather be under the bed or in your lap!\n\nWalter is learning to go potty outside but still wears a belly band inside to keep the furniture safe.\n\nWalter is great around other dogs but we don't know about cats. Because of his personality we're guessing he'd be great with kids but haven't tested this out yet.\n\nWalter is approximately 6 years old and weighs approximately 13-15 pounds.\n\nAdoption fee is $250 + $15 microchip\n\nWalter is being fostered in North Olmsted/Westlake, OH\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our adoption fee includes vaccinations, wormer and in all adult dogs, spay/neuter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where does my adoption fee go? Ask your vet how much he/she charges for the following:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spaying/neutering $150-300</p>\n<p>Distemper vaccination $20-30 x2</p>\n<p>Rabies vaccination $15-25</p>\n<p>Heartworm test $15-35</p>\n<p>Flea/tick treatment $50-200</p>\n<p>Wormer $20-$45</p>\n<p>Dental $100-$300</p>\n<p>Microchip $25-$50 <br /> Not to mention the office visit cost.</p>\n<p>Please consider all that is done for your rescue dog prior to complaining about the adoption fee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mini Mutts Rescue DOES consider adopting to families with young children. Please send an email if you'd like an application to adopt this dog - nels44077@yahoo.com\u00a0<br /><br />A fenced yard is preferred.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We do adopt outside the state of Ohio. However, we require the adopting family to drive to Ohio to meet/adopt the dog applying for. Should this be more than a day's drive, we can arrange transport with the adopting family driving at least half way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"body\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"43%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"15%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.kuranda.com/shop/donate.asp?intShelterID=1201&strFormStage=b\" target=\"_top\"><img src=\"http://www.kuranda.com/images/icon.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Donate a Bed\" /></a></td>\n<td width=\"85%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">We use Patented Kuranda Dog Beds because they are durable, chew proof and easy to clean.

            "description": "Name: Magda\nBreeds: Pit Bull Mix\nAge: Young Adult\nGender: Female\n\nMagda is a beautiful, pointy ear pittie mix who despite her sunny disposition has not had a life of rainbows and sunshine. She came into the shelter as a stray with scarring around her neck from a previously embedded collar. Ending up in the shelter was the best thing that happened to her...she was adored there and they worked so hard to find a rescue to take her. It's impossible not to fall in love with her. From her silly wiggles, her smile when she gets a butt scratch, her joy at racing around the yard with her dog pals, and her champion snuggle skills, Magda is a heart stealer. She is excellent with other large breed dogs and loves to play with them. She would love a playful canine companion in her new home though she loves people just as much. Typical to bully breeds, she can be a bit mouthy when she plays but is learning that toys are for mouthing and to contain her happy exuberance. She has a higher prey drive so needs a home without cats, small critters, or small/toy dogs...they look too much like little rabbits and squirrels to resist chasing and getting rough with them. Walks rank high on her favorite things and she is learning her leash manners.  Magda is housetrained (though expect transition accidents like any dog), crates well for the workday, and is learning basic commands. She is extremely eager to learn and loves to hear what a good girl she is. She would be the star of an obedience class for sure!\n\nRequirements: Home with yard space. No cats\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104997748162\n\nYou can email fostersheadinghomek9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n\n",

They are border collie-corgis and probably favor the border collie more in looks with longer legs and tails.\n\nThey are siblings but do not need to stay together. If they do not go together they do need to go to a home where there is another friendly dog.\n \nBoth girls will be current on age appropriate vaccinations. Their adoption fee is $275 each. There will also be a $100 deposit for their spay which will be refunded upon proof of spay.\n\n \nTippy is the \"leader\" of this duo. She will likely need to be challenged and kept busy to keep her occupied. Perhaps a candidate for agility or some other dog sport. Sugar is a bit more reserve but she too can be devilishly smart. They are typical busy puppies in constant motion.\n\nThey are a work in progress with house-training and other things training like basic manners. These girls must have ACTIVE owners who will keep them engaged. Training will be an absolute MUST. We prefer not to place them in a home with children under the age of 5. We do NOT know how they will do with cats. They are puppies they will probably chase a cat.\n \nInterested persons should submit an application through the website for consideration. www.corgiconnection.com\n\n \n \n",

I'm a Blue Lacy mix, and boy do I like to have a job to do!\n\nMy story starts off sadly I'm afraid.  A daughter of one of the Lucies volunteers is in the real estate business.  A house was being sold, and the previous home owner made the daughter aware that I was a stray that had been coming up.  They had been feeding me and were worried what would become of me when they moved.  They were so sweet and good to take care of me like that.\n\nSo she reached out to Lucies to see if they could help.  They agreed that they could help and would take me to the vet and be boarded and then eventually bring me to the rescue once a spot opened up.\n\nA few days later, I came up to eat and was totally exhausted and in excruciating pain.  Mean, filthy, stinky wild hogs had gotten ahold of me and attacked me!!  I was immediately taken to the vet and underwent surgery to close the large wound on my back, complete with a drainage tube.\n\nEven though I didn't know these Lucies people, I was very patient with them once it was time to remove the tube, and even more so when the stitches were removed.  These are some very special people and I'm very grateful for them!\n\nI'd truly love to be someone's lap dog.  I just love to be held tightly and loved on.  Oh, I do NOT like fireworks.  And one more thing, I truly hate pork now ;)\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

You may be required to travel if approved for adoption.\n\n\nABOUT TROOPER - From his foster...\n\nHurricane Delta hit our small part of the world in Louisiana October 9, 2020, and devastated much of our area, for a second time, after Hurricane Laura had wreaked havoc on nearby cities. We had our power restored sooner this time, on October 15th, although not all of our area had their electricity back. In that night, around 10:30pm, I received a frantic message from a friend who had a tree fallen in her house. She thought she could hear a puppy crying under her home. She felt terrible and was in tears because she told me she and her daughters had heard something the night before, but they have their own furbabies and thought it was was of them making a sound inside their home. Keep in mind this was 6 days after a second major storm had turned all of our lives into a nightmare that we all hoped to wake up from. I ran upstairs to tel my husband that I was driving to Jennings to get under my friend's house to get the puppy. He told me that I wasn't thinking rationally again (he is the police chief), since there was still a curfew plus not all street lights were on. We wouldn't be able to even see enough with flashlights. My friend and I stayed on the phone for a long time that night. We both cried and prayed. A lot.\n\nMy husband assured me that our wonderful ACO Chelsi would go first thing in the morning.\n\nThat she did, with a police officer. Chelsi crawled under the home, and Trooper hobbled away in fear, crying all the way, in the direction of the police officer, who scooped him up.\n\nChelsi took Trooper straight to the vet. It was determined he most likely was hit by a car. He had a fractured pelvis and broken humerus bone in his front right leg.\n\nThat was October 16, 2020. Trooper went back to the shelter and Chelsi made a post saying what the estimates costs would be for the surgery to help this precious little boy. Donations poured in to our nonprofit JDAWG, and we raised MORE than we asked. Trooper's surgery was scheduled.\n\nOn October 17, I had to say the hardest goodbye ever when my foster Teddy left on his Looking Glass Animal Rescue transport to his new family. A piece of my heart went to New York that morning. (I now am overjoyed with Teddy's beautiful family, and he lives like a king.). We had plans to pick up Trooper on our way back from letting our Teddy go. I cried the whole way to the shelter. Then I saw that sweet face that actually tried to smile at me when I held him. He cried when I picked him up; I soon learned how to hold him so he was in less pain. I held him close and cried with him many, many times when he was hurting(he had medicine for the pain). He whines when he can't find me, but is getting better at me not being around 24/7.\n\nHis surgery went well, and a pin was placed to stabilize his bone. He never was crated because he had a hard time moving around, so he is pad trained, and is going outside now, but still has accidents every now and then. He had the pin removed, then was xrayed after being neutered on January 5. His leg is almost 100% healed!!! Our vet said he may have early onset arthritis, but he runs and plays now without the heartbreaking cries of pain that we heard at the beginning with any slight wrong movement. He is just the sweetest boy!! Would truly make a wonderful family companion. So loving and so deserving of the most amazing home!! He is super handsome, too!!\n\nTrooper is UTD on all vaccinations, heartworm negative and takes a monthly preventative. He loves carrot sticks and mostly any food or snack he can get. We feed him 4Health Small bites from Tractor Supply. He is spoiled and very loves attention. He enjoys playing with all our dogs, but runs to me if the playing gets too rough for him. He is a precious soul and we are looking for a very special home for this baby.\n\nI love Trooper so very much and the only rescue I entrust him to is Looking Glass. We have been in communication ever since Teddy left my arms and Trooper came into them.\n\nLooking Glass Animal Rescue is a 501(c)(3) virtual rescue, using a network of dedicated fosters throughout the Northeast to care for our animals until adoption.

Holly is a beautiful girl who\u2019s sweet personality and nice demeanor charms everyone she meets - she always seems to have a smile on her face and a wagging tail. She does well with other dogs and seems to like the cats at her foster as well. Holly is learning to walk well on leash and while she may be a bit timid trying new things, she is eager to learn. Holly was abandoned and left to wander around. Fortunately for her, she wandered up to a good Samaritan's home and decided to hang around as she was getting fed. They contacted animal control and sadly, nobody was looking for her. So, we are not sure what circumstances she came from, but we are all happy Holly is safe now in rescue. She would do great with a kind family to show her the ropes, a fenced in yard and with dog or cat companions...she's a sweetie :)\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Meet Dirk! Dirk is believed to be around 2 years old, and likely an Olde English Bulldog, or an english/American mix.\n\nDirk came in as a stray. The family that had found him wanted to keep him, but said he was getting nippy with the kids - not surprising, as he had wicked ear infections and some angry skin issues. He is always going to have some sensitive handling issues, as he has a lot of scar tissue built up in his ears from chronic infection, and we believe may at one point have had a broken tail. And he *hates* baths. So, we are looking for an adult-only home for him. *Possibly* with an easy-going female dog, but bulldogs are known to often develop issues with other dogs. He's done ok so far with limited meets, but absolutely no small dogs as he will run them over. Prospective adopters should have bulldog or similar experience, and be able to financially maintain future medical issues. He is on a limited-ingredient (non-prescription) food. He is NOT a lazy bulldog, and likes to keep active and is very playful.\n\nFor more information or to request an adoption application, please stop into the shelter, or contact us via email.\n\nshelteradoptions@baycounty.net\nbollmanje@baycounty.net\n(989) 894-0679\n",

He can be a little nervous when first meeting new people but once he feels comfortable you'll see how sweet he is. Gibson enjoys treats and will gently take one out of your hand.\n\nGibson would benefit most in a home that's patient and willing to work with him on socialization and allow him to decompress. Being the only animal in the home might be best for Gibson until he completely comes out of his shell. Gibson would make a great companion!\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY. We do not have a facility that the public can come and view our pets at.",

My foster mom says I am such a happy and energetic boy. I just know I like to play with all people, dogs, cats. Everyone is my friend! \n\nI'm working on this thing called potty training, for now I am wearing a belly band until I get the hang of it. I'm a smart boy so I know I will get it soon. What can I say? I'm just an all around good boy! I hope you want to meet me soon!\n\nAdoption fee is $300 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.\n\nSTS is a foster-based and volunteer-run rescue. We do not have a physical location or set hours for you to meet dogs, and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in foster homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is completed you will be able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs. We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A Petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application.

She is a bit shy at first but warms up quickly. She is good with other dogs. She loves people but is untested with kids. She is food motivated and learns quickly. She is used to being boarded and has been in doggy day care. She was given up by her owner though no fault of her own. Unfortunately due to some family health issues the owner has to travel and can't provide Bianca what she needs. She was very loved by her previous owner and will have an adjustment period to adapt to her new family.\n\nPriority will be given to adopter with German shepherd experience and also wants to adopt her brother Brutus.\n\nAdopter must have a fenced yard, own their own home and have with an established vet. We will be taking applications and reviewing them closely over the next few weeks. A home visit will also be required before adoption can be complete. The first step in our adoption process is filling out our application completely. \nhttps://graingercountyhumanesociety.org/available-dogs",

            "description": "Muddy as he is called, or sometimes Rex which he is also called, is an active, quick learning, high energy, conks out when tired, plays well with others fun dog.  He is just a year old and would do great with someone who is looking for a four legged companion to take on adventures, participate in doggy obedience and spend a lot of time playing outside followed by a nice nap!\nNotes from his foster mom:\n12/26/2021\nSome things to share about Rex:\n-he likes to be outside\n-he has tons of energy and it takes a lot right now to tire him although he does slow down and lay still \n-he gets along well with his foster brothers and has learned to titrate himself down a bit when playing with Jax (with Jax\u2019s vocalization) our older dog\n -his body is slight and he is very fast; we would not recommend a non-fenced yard \n-I let him out one afternoon not realizing there was a squirrel on the bird feeder; \nRex was faster than the squirrel; he cornered it on the ground where two sections of the fence meet and tussled with it until it managed to get away and run up the tree; \nit took a lot of doing to redirect him from jumping up on the tree trunk; a home with small animals may not be a good fit -he is very smart and friendly and learns quickly; he also is sensitive to a stern voice -he does well in the crate and does signal when he needs to go out (sometimes he will ring the bells we have hanging on the door handle) -his relationship with food is complicated; he eats to quickly (I have ordered a slow feeding bowl); he is not food aggressive but does hover very closely over the other two while they are eating; we feed the dogs twice a day and Rex seems to be continuously hungry (nosing at the food bag, pushing the empty bowl on the floor); not sure if he\u2019s still not comfortable here or perhaps he didn\u2019t know where his next meal was coming from in whatever environment he came out of) -Sam and Rex will drink out of the water bowl at the same time -Sam and Jax are good role models for him and he pays attention to both of them\n\n1/7/2021\nRex is doing well with his foster brothers and learning how to take turns.  \nDid you know that he is very active? ?  Oh my goodness! \n He is smart and learns new things pretty quickly including letting me try to wipe some of the mud off his paws before he comes in the house. \n He lifts his feet for me now.  The slow feeder bowl has helped with his eating. \n He does have a bad habit of being very persistent with begging/surfing for people food. \n That correction will take a bit of time.  He loves to be outside and does not seem to be bothered by any element he has come into contact with so far.  Cold, ice, rain, puddles, mud - he takes it all in stride.  Rex and Sam like to play chase.  Rex is faster so he is usually the chasee.  One afternoon Rex ran full blast toward the side of the deck and at the last moment dove under and army crawled the length of the deck underneath exiting the other side covered in mud.  Yikes!  He had a blast and just kept going.\n\nThe one attached photo is a rare moment of complete conk out for Rex.",

He is a 9-10 yr old rough coat Jack Russell. \nRoadie has lived on a farm he is originally from Arkansas.\nHe lost his home when the family divorced.  He is crate and leash trained, and according to the family, completely house trained.  \nVery handsome fella, but VERY overweight.   Needs to be on a program of real food, NOT KIBBLE.  Meat and veggies. \nHas great personality, very sweet and responsive.\nIs good with children and good with other dogs and cats.\nHe has couple of fatty tumors. Seen by vet, determined to be harmless. \nThe owner has just gone through divorce recently and a work related injury and is not working and will not be returning. \nEmail us and share! almosthomerescue@gmail.com------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TO BE CONSIDERED TO ADOPT A DOG FROM ALMOST HOME RESCUE YOU MUST FIRST COMPLETE THE ADOPTION APPLICATION.  YOU WILL FIND THE ONLINE FORM HERE -\nhttps://almosthomedogrescue.com/adoption_application/\nIf you have questions please email us at:  AlmostHomeRescue@gmail.com or you can call us at 941-704-4765\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nALL DOGS ADOPTED FROM ALMOST HOME RESCUE ARE SPAYED OR NEUTERED, MICROCHIPPED, VACCINES UP TO DATE AND HEARTWORM TESTED.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPLEASE READ!  \n1. Jack Russell Terriers need homes with a secure fence.  Underground fencing is NOT safe for a  Jack Russell.  \n2. Jack Russell terriers are bred to be hunting dogs and are not suited to apartment or condo life.  The hunting instincts and prey drive cannot be trained out of  these terriers and they will stay active in this way all their lives.\n3. We do not adopt Jack Russell Terriers to families withe small children (under 6) as terriers are not patient with the antics of a small toddler.   \n4. Jack Russell Terriers can not safely coexist in a home with cats, birds, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, etc, as terriers were bred to hunt and can kill small animals.  They are hunters and they never give up. \n5. Please keep an open mind and consider your lifestyle both today and 10 years from now before you apply for a dog that may not be a good fit for the long run.",

Scout's the first to come inside when it's cold out. She's a smart girl and she'll request to be held or go to the door when she's ready to go inside. Scout loves to cuddle up in her foster mom's lap or plop herself right in the middle of the puppy pile for maximum comfort! Scout will make a great companion for the right person or family.\n\nScout's young and requires a home with someone around and who isn't gone long hours. All family members need to be at least 7 years old. Scout's still perfecting her puppy manners, but she's a quick study. A fenced in yard that is accessible from the home is necessary for Scout, so that she can play safely and continue her house-training. Scout would be thrilled to have a furry sibling in her forever home that can be gentle with her, but it's not a requirement.\n\nScout will be spayed before going to her forever home and she'll be up to date on her vaccines.",

All family members need to be at least 7 years old. Shortbread's still perfecting her puppy manners, but she's a quick study and will do anything for a treat! A fenced in yard that is accessible from the home is necessary for Shortbread, so that she can play safely and practice her house-training. Shortbread hopes to have a furry sibling in her forever home that she can play with.\n\nShortbread will be spayed before going to her forever home and she'll be up to date on her vaccines.",

            "description": "Meet little TInkerbell. This poor old gal lost her human and then got shuffled around family members she didn't know for several months before being dumped at the pound. As a result, Tinkerbell has developed some attitude and will snap/bite if you're not slow and careful with her.\n\nTinkerbell  is older and has been neglected as you can see by the missing fur on her rump. With good food and proper care we expect this fur to grow in eventually. \n\nTinkerbell LOVES human food!! She turns her nose up at bacon treats and gobbles a bite of bread. She is housetrained and will go outside and come back inside when finished. She knows her name and will follow you or just go lay down on a doggie bed somewhere.\n\nTinkerbell sticks to herself and will tolerate a good petting of her back but be careful, when she's done putting up with it she will growl then snap so watch/listen carefully. Of course, all this could change as she realizes she's safe and loved from here on out but we make no guarantee of this.\n\nTinkerbell just needs a loving home who understands she's just a cranky old dog. A home who will love her no matter what, feed her, give her several dog beds to choose from, has a yard for her to wander a bit and do her business, and let her live out her retirement years in peace.  \n\nIs this you?\n\nApproximate Age: 13 years old\nApproximate Weight: 13 pounds\nAdoption Fee: TBD\n\nTinkerbell is being fostered in North Olmsted/Westlake, OH\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our adoption fee includes vaccinations, wormer and in all adult dogs, spay/neuter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where does my adoption fee go? Ask your vet how much he/she charges for the following:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spaying/neutering $150-300</p>\n<p>Distemper vaccination $20-30 x2</p>\n<p>Rabies vaccination $15-25</p>\n<p>Heartworm test $15-35</p>\n<p>Flea/tick treatment $50-200</p>\n<p>Wormer $20-$45</p>\n<p>Dental $100-$300</p>\n<p>Microchip $25-$50 <br /> Not to mention the office visit cost.</p>\n<p>Please consider all that is done for your rescue dog prior to complaining about the adoption fee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mini Mutts Rescue DOES consider adopting to families with young children. Please send an email if you'd like an application to adopt this dog - nels44077@yahoo.com\u00a0<br /><br />A fenced yard is preferred.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We do adopt outside the state of Ohio. However, we require the adopting family to drive to Ohio to meet/adopt the dog applying for. Should this be more than a day's drive, we can arrange transport with the adopting family driving at least half way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"body\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"43%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"15%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.kuranda.com/shop/donate.asp?intShelterID=1201&strFormStage=b\" target=\"_top\"><img src=\"http://www.kuranda.com/images/icon.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Donate a Bed\" /></a></td>\n<td width=\"85%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">We use Patented Kuranda Dog Beds because they are durable, chew proof and easy to clean.

Mace walks well on a leash and always has a toy in his mouth. Mace needs a calm 1 story home without young children to live out his golden years. Mace does have some pain in his hips so a home with very few stairs would be best for this old guy.

He does well with other small dogs and enjoys a good romp in the fenced yard with the other two smaller, but bigger than him by a bit, dogs that belong to his foster mom and dad.  \nhe is smart and learns quickly and can be adept at training the humans caring for him.  For example, he knows to sit in front of the refrigerator just at bedtim and wait for his bedtime treat of a hot dog treat.  Smart boy.\nHe would do best in a home with dogs of likesize and no children under six years of age.\nHe would love a lap to call his own because his absolute favorite activity is to cuddle with his foster dad on the couch.\n\n\nThis dog is available for adoption.  If you are interested, please email us at petsconnect@petsconnect.org to request an application.\nMedical: Our dogs are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. \nCoVid: due to the current CoVid panademic PetsConnect is not holding adoption events in local pet stores.  However, we are continuing to do adoptions.   Email us to request an application, fill it out and return it.  A volunteer will follow up and once approved set up a meet and greet followed by adoption if it works out.\nWant to Volunteer? We run on volunteer power and can always use help during adoption events as well as those willing to foster dogs.  Email us at petsconnect@petsconnect.org for a volunteer application.\nWant to Donate? treats, rawhides, toys, wet food, blankets are always welcome.\nPetsConnect! animals are tech-savvy!

            "description": "Zorri is a 4 year old Male Shar-pei / Black Lab mix that is a stocky 70 pounds with a sleek black coat. Zorri and his sister Zia came to BYC after being surrendered to a shelter where he stood little chance of adoption. However, one look in his eyes will melt your heart when you see the gentle character there. He is so loving and sweet and wants to be a lap dog because snuggling in your lap is exactly where he wants to be! Zorri is crate trained, house broken, great around children. He does jump up as he always wants your attention so he may be too large for young children, but he is redirected well. He is also good on a leash and loves walks. Zorri is truly an amazing dog, and will make one lucky family very happy. Zorri would prefer to be the only pet in the home.\n\nZorri's adoption fee is $250 which includes his neuter, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, lepto), microchip, heartworm test and flea and heartworm prevention. Also, six weeks of obedience classes if you chose to do so.\n\nDUE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS: TO HELP US LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING, OUR ADOPTION CENTER IS OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY TO APPROVED APPLICANTS. PLEASE FILL OUT THE ADOPTION APPLICATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET ZORRI. FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE YOU TO ADOPT.",

They are heartbroken that she cannot come with them and they are hoping to find that great new home for her!\n\nA mix of German Shepherd/Collie/with a bit of Chow thrown in, she is all tan with the most beautiful black ears-so pretty!  And, she is smart!  She has been with us thru levels I and 1 1/2, done very well and is anxious to show you all that she knows!  She is looking for a quiet home, a fenced in yard to run in would be a plus, she presently lives with children but would probably be happier with a less active home.  Being the only pet in the home is exactly what she is asking for!\n\nHer past has included being blinded in one eye from having a bee lodged in her eye (ouch!) and she does have seizures that are infrequent and presently not requiring medication.  She has adjusted to well to both.  She is afraid of the vacuum cleaner so now you would have an excuse to use it less!\n\nStats: 65 lbs, 6 years old, not crate trained but we'd be happy to help with that skill!\n\nIf you would like to know more about Isabell, please contact Our Companions Animal Rescue at 860-242-9999 or e-mail to helpline@ourcompanions.org\n",

I didn't either until just now ;)  I however, am not abrasive at all.  I love to mix and mingle and play!\n\nSo me and a sweet dog friend of mine were found hanging out on this lady's porch. She called up the peeps at Lucies Project to see if they could take us. They had asked her if she had any safe place to put us until they could come and get us. Unfortunately, she did not. No fence or anything. So, they then asked her to take us to the vet for safekeeping, since Lucies was full at that time.\n\nThe technician at the vet said that he lived on the county road that we were found on and he would see if he could find our owners. Surely we belonged to someone! The only thing he could find out was that the people in the area were tired of us chasing their cattle.....oops. We were just having a little fun after all ;)\n\nOur days were numbered, so we sure were glad when Lucies found a space for us :)\n\nI'm very outgoing and I respectfully sit when I want some attention. How about considering me for adoption? I'd love to have a furever home, with a fence of course so I can't wander around :)\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

He is a 2 year old husky, that recently found his way to Paws and Prayers for unknown reasons. He is a very sweet boy, loves to run and play. He is good with other dogs of his size, he hasn't been around small dogs. Glacier would do best in a home with a fenced in yard and a adult only home without cats. We would like for his adopters to have husky experience as well. Glacier doesn't have many manners and will need some work with his jumping habits, his adoption fee is $250 he will be fixed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

Their owner has cancer, and sadly had to go into hospice.\n\nShe is a gorgeous black and tan short hair purebred dachshund. 12 years old, and weighs 13 pounds.\n\nUp-to-date all all vaccinations and vetting. They love to go on walks, and then snuggle together.\n\nFrom their foster: R & L are bonded and are rarely out of sight of each other. Both are lively and energetic. They are very affectionate not timid or shy.\n\nCrate trained and housebroken they are used to a regular routine which includes lots of lap time. Though they've spent most of their lives indoors they now enjoy lots of time outdoors exploring the garden. They walk well on leashes and when off leash both respond to being called by their names.\n\nThey have no problem interacting with the geriatric dachshund already in my house. No aggression regarding attention, food, water, beds, or toys.\n\nThere were no children in their home and there are none here so I cannot say how they would respond to a child.\n\nIf you are interested in giving these two love bugs a forever home, please go to our website\n\nand fill out an adoption application.\n\nhttps://www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/applications/adoption-application\n\nFoster: Kristine",

Their owner has cancer, and sadly had to go into hospice.\n\nHe is a gorgeous red short hair purebred dachshund. 12 years old, and weighs 15 pounds.\n\nUp-to-date all all vaccinations and vetting. They love to go on walks, and then snuggle together.\n\nFrom their foster:\n\nR & L are bonded and are rarely out of sight of each other. Both are lively and energetic. They are very affectionate not timid or shy.\n\nCrate trained and housebroken they are used to a regular routine which includes lots of lap time. Though they've spent most of their lives indoors they now enjoy lots of time outdoors exploring the garden. They walk well on leashes and when off leash both respond to being called by their names.\n\nThey have no problem interacting with the geriatric dachshund already in my house. No aggression regarding attention, food, water, beds, or toys.\n\nThere were no children in their home and there are none here so I cannot say how they would respond to a child.\n\nIf you are interested in giving these two love bugs a forever home, please go to our website\n\nand fill out an adoption application.\n\nhttps://www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/applications/adoption-application\n\nFoster: Kristine",

Biscotti's always down for a good time and he's happy to help around the house, so long as it involves spending quality time together. He's been known to chase the Swiffer and disperse toys around the room. Biscotti's affectionate and he's the first to cuddle in his foster mom's lap when given the opportunity. Biscotti plays nicely with all his foster siblings. Biscotti likes to adventure, play with toys and prance around.\n\nBiscotti's young and requires a home with someone around and who isn't gone long hours. All family members need to be at least 7 years old. He's still working on his puppy manners, but he's eager to please and is very treat and affection motivated! A fenced in yard that is accessible from the home is necessary for Biscotti, so that he can play safely and continue his house-training. Biscotti would be overjoyed to have a furry sibling to keep him company in his forever home, but he'd also be happy to receive all of his family's undivided attention and affection.\n\nBiscotti will be fixed before going to his forever home and he'll be up to date on his vaccines.",

Buckeye's the largest of his siblings and the most independent. Buckeye's perfectly content playing on his own with a squeaky toy or ball, but it seems his siblings have other plans for him. Buckeye is constantly under playful attack from his siblings, since apparently he's the most fun to play with! Buckeye plays nicely, but could do without all the fuss. Buckeye is more laid-back than some of his go-getter siblings, but he still has plenty of puppy energy to keep him busy! Buckeye enjoys affection from his foster mom, especially when it involves a belly rub.\n\nBuckeye is young and requires e a home with someone around and who isn't gone long hours. All family members need to be at least 7 years old. Buckeye's still working on his puppy manners, but he's a quick study and very treat motivated! A fenced in yard that is accessible from the home is necessary for Buckeye, so that he can play safely and practice his house-training. Buckeye would be thrilled to have a furry siblings to keep him company in his forever home, but it's not a requirement as he does well on his own too.\n\nBuckeye will be fixed before going to his forever home and he'll be up to date on his vaccines.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Pit Mix|4 yrs|45 lbs|$400.00Sophie is a 2-year-old, 40-pound pitbull-mix in search of a home that fits just right.\n\nSophie finds that there is no such thing as too long of a walk. She loves to wind through the neighborhood route, and wants to play with any other dog she meets, big or small. Whether too cold outside, too hot outside or just right she is sure to ensure that her family gets out everyday for some time in the fresh air. This girl is happy to be where her people are, whether as co-captain of the car, or enjoying a toy by the fireplace. Her favorite indoor hobbies include finding that just right pressure of the stuffed toy where the stuffing meets the squeaker. She will chew and chew until the squeaker is no longer. At the end of a playful and exciting day I will snuggle up right next to my people ready for a good Netflix binge or deep read.\n\nSophie has gotten along well with mama cat, which she is curious about, but ignores; or papa dog, which she is always trying to goad into playing with her. She enjoys the energy of a baby or young human, but in her playful exuberance may jump up and knock a young tot down, so a home with a young child may not be the best fit. Sophie would also be happy to be the only furry darling in her home.\n\nSophie is still very much a puppy, and will need to continue her leash training in her forever home. She has excellent manners, making her an impeccable houseguest, and will take treats gently from her human.\n\nSophie, like Golidlocks, is in search of a place to dine, play, and rest that is just right. This loving girl is looking for a home with long walks, short bursts of play, and cuddles mixed in throughout the day. Start the first chapter of Sophie's fairytale by filling out an application to meet her at https://rescuecrew.org/adopt-animal-in-need/#adoptionapplication\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

He has a short coat with beautiful dapple markings and stunning amber eyes.\n\nWe expect him to be lab size as an adult. \n\nYou've heard the saying \"old soul\". Well Copper seems to have an old soul. He is pretty laid back and takes new experiences slowly. In a room of puppies he will play and engage but you might find him a short time later laying to the side just watching the other puppies rough and tumble play.\n\nWe don't know the details of his past other than he was found along with 6 other puppies at the dump, presumably dumped like trash.\n\nHe is looking for his own family who will continue working on house and crate training (he is doing great) and teaching him to be the best family pet he can be. \n\nIf interested adopting someone's trash and making him your treasure. please email aarfalabama@gmail.com for an application.",

            "description": "Meet Adoptable PENNY! Looking for the perfect proportions of sweet, sassy, and smart?  Do you find yourself missing that one special ingredient? If so, Penny will add the perfect amount of spice to your life! Penny is a somewhat dominant female with a medium to high energy level, weighs approximately 50 lbs., and is approximately 2 years old.  She is a wonderful, playful little girl who is very dedicated to her people and is happiest being by your side.\n\nPenny co-exists with balanced, male and female dogs in her household, but could potentially do well as the only canine in the household.  Due to natural prey drive, Penny cannot coexist with small animals.  She needs consistent, loving leadership, as Penny will happily take lead without it.  We advise any children in the household are 10 years and older.\n\nPenny will be confirmed heartworm negative in February, is current on vaccinations and heartworm/flea preventative, spayed, crate-trained, housebroken, microchipped, and knows basic commands. Penny is currently on Proin Chewable Tablets 2 times a day for some bladder issues that arose after administration of steroids. Proin helps regain proper muscle tone for bladder control and works 100%! Penny will be weaned down in hopes she will no longer need it. Many dogs are very success at being weaned off. We like to be truthful about our dogs so adopters know the needs of our adoptable dogs so please do not let this minor issue sway you away from considering this wonderful girl that will be a wonderful companion!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Penny, please email streethearts.animal.rescue@gmail.com",

I was sooooo skinny and dirty and totally matted who knows how long I was running loose.\n\nThe nice pound worker called this rescue because it was urgent that I see a vet, I had a lot of injuries and was pretty busted up!\nI went in for emergency surgery cause my hip was broken really badly but they got me help and I'm healing up really good!\n\nThey expect me to make a full recovery and I'm feeling SO MUCH BETTER!\n\nI am a 1 year old Terrier & Havanese mix and right now I only weigh 15 pounds but I still need to put a few more on.\n\nI'm house and crate trained, I love other dogs too!\n\nI can be a little timid at first but once I get to know you I will be your bestest friend!\n\nI'm looking for an ADULT ONLY home-sorry no kiddos-they make me too nervous.\n\nMy favorite things to do are to play and snuggle with a human, could YOU be that human?\n\nIf you think we are goot match please go to www.bulliesandbuddies.com and fill out an application to ADOPT me ok?\n\nI am in the Southern CA area- sorry but my rescue does NOT adopt out of state \n\n",

Hmm, what can I say about me?  The first photo my foster mom saw of me I was skin and bones.  Luckily, a lady nearby started feeding me, she could tell I had puppies stashed away somewhere.  Eventually, I trusted this lady and brought my two puppies to her.  I was right to trust her, she helped find homes for my puppies, one of them traveled to a SNARR adaptor in the NE last year and a SNARR foster mom for me.  Before I could travel, my foster mom was concerned my Heartworm disease was pretty advanced so I stayed with her to complete my Heartworm treatment.  My last injection was at the end of December, so now it's my turn to find an awesome forever home.  I'd love a yard, I'm a country girl so a big yard would be awesome.  My foster mom would like it fenced so I stay safe.  I love a soft place to lay and often can find me in the big dog bed in the living room or on one of the recliners.  I'm a sucker for affection.  Sometimes, I get too excited and a bit mouthy because I love to be loved so smaller kids might not be the best for me.  I love antlers, peanut butter, and generally enjoy most chew toys.  I've enjoyed my canine foster siblings but sometimes I can a little grumpy with my sisters.  I'm crate and house trained and good on a leash.  Well, I guess that's it in a nutshell.  If you are looking for a confident, affectionate walking buddy that love to be spoiled maybe I'm the girl for you.\n\nPearl was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. She will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on Feb 15th ready for adoption! To apply to adopt Pearl, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

He came to BASH after seriously injuring his leg. He is on the mend, though, and is an active young boy looking for a family to love him. He does have some separation issues, so would do best in a home with another active dog where he can have a companion to play with. He is potty trained, but due to his young age, doesn't give a lot of time to let you know he needs out. He still gets excited on the leash and will pull, but is getting better; and he will need some more training as he goes on. He does well at sitting for treats. Due to the continuing treatment for his leg, we can accept inquiries, but he probably won't be available to a new home till the end of January. Contact us if you would like more information Go to BAYAREASIBERIAN.org for contact information on the foster dog.",

            "description": "Howdy,\n\nMy name is Elijah.  It's cool to have a biblical name, don't ya think?  After all, Elijah was a prophet and a miracle worker!  Of course, God hasn't performed any miracles through me like raining fire down from heaven, but there's always tomorrow!\n\nSo me and a sweet dog friend of mine were found hanging out on this lady's porch.  She called up the peeps at Lucies Project to see if they could take us.  They had asked her if she had any safe place to put us until they could come and get us.  Unfortunately, she did not. No fence or anything.  So, they then asked her to take us to the vet for safekeeping, since Lucies was full at that time.\n\nThe technician at the vet said that he lived on the county road that we were found on and he would see if he could find our owners.  Surely we belonged to someone!  The only thing he could find out was that the people in the area were tired of us chasing their cattle.....oops.  We were just having a little fun after all ;)\n\nOur days were numbered, so we sure were glad when Lucies found a space for us :)\n\nI'm a sweet boy and I have the cutest pointy ears, don't you think?  How about considering me for adoption?  I'd love to have a furever home, with a fence of course so I can't wander around :)  \n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "Charley was given up to the Bedford Humane Society at three months old, because the lady and her 12 year old daughter could no longer care for her.  They took her in at three weeks and the constant care was more than they could handle.  She did not know the breed of the Mom and was told the pup was a male so she named her Charley.  She does answer to her name.  So it is only a guess as to her breed and only going by her looks.  Charley is a very active girl and wants a lot of attention.  She is responsive to training and loves to play fetch with her toys.  She is learning not to jump up on everything.  She needs a family that will have patience with her training and give her the attention she craves.  She is crate trained but not completely housebroken.  She is learning to walk well on the leash without jumping all over.  Charley would probably do better with an older child in the family that will be consistent with her training.  She is tentative meeting other dogs but would probably be ok with another dog when she feels comfortable.  At three months she has not had a lot of socializing.  Another dog might be good for her to help keep her active in play.  Charley has been dewormed, microchipped, and has been started on heartworm  preventive and has received the Distemper-Parvo combination vaccine, and Kennel Cough vaccine. \n\n Since she is not yet spayed, Charley is not available for adoption outside of the counties contiguous to Bedford County.\n\nFor more information, please call the Bedford Humane Society at 540-586-6100, or go to www.bhsva.org/adoptions-home.htm to fill out an adoption application.  \n",

He is learning some long-overdue leash manners as he's never been trained. Sadly, Rocky was kept in a cage on a blueberry farm so he's a little behind in his training. Rocky loves other dogs but can be reactive on leash depending on the other dog/s (work in progress). He loves the dogs in his foster home and plays nicely. Rocky will need a strong handler and has not been trained to recall as of yet (no off-leash). He was neutered in early Jan and has fully recovered. House-training has been going great and no accidents since the first day he arrived. We do believe Rocky was mis-handled in the past as he can be hand-shy around his head/collar so patience there is needed. He has some drive but not over the top like some German Shepherds. He loves his toys and is learning to trade. Once settled, Rocky loves to climb onto the sofa and cuddle in for a good movie or show. LOTS of potential in this HANDSOME boy!!!\n",

            "description": "FOSTER OR ADOPT\n\nEarl is an 8 year old, 55 pound Bulldog/Pittie mix. Earl may be 8 years old but he's got plenty of pep and personality. He is sure to make you laugh. He loves to play and chase and rolls over to demand his belly rubs. He thinks he's a lap dog but we won't tell him otherwise.\n\nEarl is a good ole southern gentleman and comes to Ohio from Memphis. His transporter said he is truly the friendliest dog she has ever met. Earl likes to lay the weight of his whole head in your hand while being pet. He is good with most other dogs and children over 8 but we don't know about cats\n\n\nOur Earl is Heartworm Positive. This is a disease that is transmitted via mosquitos and can do damage to the heart if left untreated. The most challenging part of treatment is to keep the dog quiet. Belly rubs definitely will help get Earl to quiet down nicely. Canine Collective will be sent all treatment bills if taken to our vet in Delaware/Orange Township.\n\n\n** If our dogs are posted online, they are available but may have other applications. To meet any dog, please fill out a short application in at CanineCollective.org. Our volunteers will process in about one business day and when approved you can text our kennel manager to make an appointment to meet/adopt your new forever companion. **",

Sadly, kennel life has been so stressful for her! Can you open your heart and home to Meg? We are looking for a foster or furever home where Meg can relax, decompress, and enjoy her new life as a Diamond!\n\nMeg loves being around her people, other friendly dogs, and respectful kids! And she LOVES toys! Meg is sure to bring joy to the right family, and we know that family is out there waiting for her!\n\nIn order to fully decompress, Meg will need a couple of weeks of at least some downtime and separation from other dogs in the home. We do think she will love walks or supervised playtime with other dogs as she adjusts to her new home. At this time, Meg would also probably do best in a home where her people work from home or someone is home the majority of the day.\n\nReach out to us today if you are interested in fostering or adopting Meg!Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

            "description": "Dahlia is 1 in a litter of 8 puppies that were unwanted. Mom had a CSection at a vets office and the vet helped them look for rescue help. We were told Dad is a blue heeler and Mom looks to be part retriever. These puppies are large, all ranging between 19 and 23 pounds. They are very sweet, learning boundaries in a home and when to go outside. Potty reinforcement is going to be needed. Born 9/20/20, the puppies are up to date on vaccines, microchipped and will be spayed/neutered when age appropriate under the rescue.\n\nInterested in adopting me? To fill out an application visit 3 Hearts 4 Paws. Please note: we generally do not adopt out of state unless it is within 1-2 hours of us. Currently due to COVID we are unable to accommodate out of state adoptions.",

            "description": "Luna is a  2 year old, 48 lb. female\nThe best guess at her breed is: Mixed Breed\nShe would be good in a home with: Kids 10+\nShe prefers a home without: Dogs, Cats\n\nLuna is a medium energy, extremely affectionate girl. Her favorite activity is when volunteers visit her in her room for cuddles and to play tug of war. She love to be close to her people and has an endless supply of kisses. She is extremely affectionate!\n\nWhen Luna spends time outside, she likes to play with you and will do a few zoomies around the yard. Luna would like an active forever home who will exercise her by taking her on walks or playing in the backyard. She thrives on human attention and would like a family who isn't gone for too long.\n\nLuna has successfully played with a 60 lb. male shepherd at our shelter but since then hasn't been able to make another canine friend. She would like to be the only dog and will need a family who understands she doesn't like other dogs. This doesn't seem to affect her when she is on walks in the park. She passes by dogs at a distance and doesn't bark at them.\n\nVolunteers enjoy walking Luna and report back that she rides well in the car and walks well on a leash.\n\nLuna knows how to sit and is very food motivated. She appears to be house trained as she doesn't have accidents in her crate or in her room when left loose.\n\n--\n\nOur hours: In an effort to limit the number of visitors at our shelter during this time, visitors are limited to approved applicants only.\n\n\nInstructions on how to fill out our online application are on our website here: https://www.lighthouseanimalshelter.org/application-instructions\n\nWe are receiving a high number of applications at this time. Please be patient with us while we adjust to these new changes and keep in mind that our volunteers process the applications as quickly as their schedules allow.\n\nWe do not adopt on a first-come-first-serve basis, but rather by the best match between dog and family, although we will factor in the order of applications if there are equally good matches.\n\nHow you can help us process your application:\nPlease call all of your references (landlord, if applicable, vet(s) and personal references) before filling out an application to let them know that we will be calling. We are an all-volunteer program and volunteers often make reference calls from their cell phone. It will be a number your personal reference does not recognize. We understand most people will screen their calls from unknown numbers so please tell them to keep an eye on their voicemail and give the volunteer a call back at their earliest convenience. We may end up playing phone tag with your personal references but will reach out to you if we need further assistance in reaching them.\n\nHow we process your application:\nOnce we receive your application, we will check home ownership or landlord permission, personal references and vet references. We will reach out to you if we have questions during the process or if we are having trouble reaching your references either through email or phone. We will contact you when your application is fully processed to discuss how you would like to proceed with your application and to discuss dogs in our care who will be a good match for you and anyone involved in the adoption.\n\nOur adoption fee:\nOur adoption fee is $400 ($415 if paid by PayPal) which covers the costs of vetting (spay, vaccinations, heartworm testing, preventatives while in our care, deworming and microchip) and any boarding or transport fees incurred in each dog's rescue.",

She prefers to be the only fur baby in your home.\n\nThe adoption fee includes my initial vaccines, microchipping and a deworming. Before we consider any adoption, we must have the application filled out so we can better assist you in your search for your next fur baby. We are a BEST MATCH facility. We try to match the pet\u2019s personality and needs with the family\u2019s needs and lifestyle to increase the likelihood of a lifetime happy relationship for the whole family. The online application we provide on our website, achs-pets.com, is a preliminary application. After you have completed the application, please give us up to 5 working days to process it. We check vaccine records for current & past pets as well as Landlord approval if you do not own your home. If you have put in an application and did not get your 1st choice pet, please consider another of our homeless pets in need. We hope you will understand our effort to provide our animals with the best new situation that is possible.\n\nClick here to fill out our online application: http://www.achs-pets.com/Application.html",

He is a people pleaser but he is a very strong and pushy guy so he will need a confident handler to keep him in control. Scout likes to run and play so he is looking for a home with a fully fenced yard. He has lived with another dog in his previous home and they got along well. Any resident dogs will be required to come in for a meet and greet prior to adoption. Scout will need to go to a cat free home. He is unaware of just how big he is (91 pounds) and he likes to run and jump up on people and he can play a little rough, because of this he will need a  home with no children under 13. Scout knows the command \"sit\" and would love someone who will teach him more basic commands and manners. \nHe has lived his whole life as an outdoor only dog so he will need to be taught indoor etiquette in his new home. Scout is a smart dog so he should pick up on expectations quickly.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nRocking her red plaid coat is elegant 11-month-old Russia. Fit and fine at 43 pounds, she percolates with puppy energy, loves engaging in rousing play sessions with her brother Rufus several times a day, then curling up with him for a well deserved nap. Believing she's a lap dog, she also loves snuggling with her foster mom on her couch and sleeping right up against her in bed at night. Fond of toys, ropes and bones, she's slowly learning to enjoy being outdoors, seldom barks and is motivated by food and treats, accepting all of them gently. She understands \"no\" but knows no other commands, is almost fully housetrained, is learning to be less possessive of her foster mom and needs to work on her leash skills. With much still to learn and so much to give, Russia will thrive in a patient and loving home committed to completing her training and educating her fully in return for her own enduring loyalty and love.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours.

My coat is gorgeous like it was designed just for me!. It's silky and shiny and a beautiful pewter color except for my unique markings. My ears, tail and legs are all black and boy am I cute!. I'm nine years old, but you'd never know it because I still have a lot of spunk in me. I love to run outside and play in the sun. I also love to curl up on a warm lap so best of both worlds huh? I'm a new arrival at my foster home and IT'S AWESOME! My foster family has three other dogs and I wasn't too keen on them at first. I've decided they're ok now, but think I would be happier as the only dog in the house. I'm still working on perfecting house training, I sleep all night in my crate and because I only have one tooth I need tiny softened kibble, soft foods or wet food to eat and boy do I have an appetite for a little guy. Since I'm only a tiny 6 pound pooch I would do better in a home with no small children. So how about it? Don't you just want to take me home, smooch my cute face and love me forever??? I am available for adoption through SAVE Rescue Coalition. www.saverescue.org/adoptionapplication",

Honey is a work in progress.  She will need a quiet patient home.  Someone to work through her fear with her.  Honey is very submissive, timid and is not aggressive.  We would prefer for her to have another confident male dog her size in the home to help her feel secure.  We would like to see her in a home with a family who can be present in her life and asking for respectful children over 10.  \n\nOnce you have gained Honey's trust, she is a super playful energetic pup.  She lived her entire life outdoors until coming to her foster home with rescue. She loves being inside and being a family member.  Honey still has a lot to learn so it would be great if she could find a person that has experience with puppy mill dog rescues.  \n\nHoney's adoption fee is $250.00 which includes her spay, current on vaccines, de-wormed, Heartworm tested Negative and current on heartworm & flea prevention.  \n\nIf interested in meeting Honey, please complete a no obligation adoption application online at furgetmenotrescue.org   (In State of Ohio adoptions only)",

I'm vaccinated, neutered and microchipped. I am HW positive, so I will have to go through treatment but don't worry - Camo covers all the cost. I'm good with other dogs..I will chase and bark at cats, but would never hurt them.  I would do good with in any home expect probably not little kiddos, since I'm a \"special guy\". See..I have this little head tilt that the vet couldn't figure out and sometimes I will bark at the air but it's only when I get super nervous. I would love a yard to run and and explore. I'm not great in a crate, but prefer a xpen. I'm potty trained, but need to be taken out every 2-3 hours. I'm leash trained and like to go on \"strolls\" around the neighborhood, but due to my anxiety please don't take me to a dog park.  I love to carry stuff animals around and take them outside with me or just snuggle with them. I'm a happy guy looking for the perfect furever family that appreciates my personality.  I hope to meet you soon!!!\n\nYou can also read more about me here: www.thepupblog.com/post/meet-alberto\n\nAlberto's adoption fee is $300 plus 8.25% sales tax. \n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.

Maybe this was where she was abandoned.  She is a lovely girl, who will quickly roll over for belly rubs. Maggie would enjoy having a home where she can just chill out, maybe have a nice bed or even better a sofa, to lay on. Maggie has been with other dogs, but until we know her better,  we recommend that if there is another dog in the family it should be her size and maybe a male. Do not know about small dogs or cats.  Children in the family should be over the age of 7.\n\nIf you are interested in including MAGGIE in your home, please go to our website http://www.recycledrotts.org/wp/?page_id=150 for the rescue location, placement policies, placement fee and the link to our online application.",

This will give squeaks a good start to being a great family pet!\n\n\nShe will have her vaccinations, microchip and spay certificate.  Owner will sign a contract to have her spayed and will be followed up.\n\nIf you are interested in Alfie, please submit an application at:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/40468849602159",

Leo is a work in progress.  He will need a quiet patient home.  Someone to work through his fear with him.  Leo is very submissive and is not aggressive.  We would prefer for him to have another confident dog his size in the home to help him feel secure.  We would like to see him in a home with a family who can be present in his life and asking for respectful children over 10.  \n\nOnce you have gained Leo's trust, he is a super playful energetic pup.  He lived his entire life outdoors until coming to his foster home with rescue.  He loves being inside and being a family member.  Leo still has a lot to learn so it would be great if he could find a person that has experience with puppy mill dog rescues.  \n\nLeo's adoption fee is $250.00 which includes his neuter, current on vaccines, de-wormed, Heartworm tested Negative and current on heartworm & flea prevention.  \n\nIf interested in meeting Leo, please complete a no obligation adoption application online at furgetmenotrescue.org   (In State of Ohio adoptions only)",

He weighs 22 pounds right now. I can\u2019t see him gaining too much more weight. \n\nHis medical notes show that he had some sort of abscess on his jaw line or neck area, which they drained. I don\u2019t see any problems with it though. He does great with the other dogs and he will come sit beside you. \n\nHe would be a great dog for some growing boys.  If you are interested in adopting Hermes, please go to our website and complete an application for adoption:\n https://www.chloespetrescue.org/application\n\nHermes' adoption fee is $275, which includes his vetting (neuter, rabies vaccination, parvo/distemper and bordetella vaccinations, a microchip, and de-worming).",

Rudy is housebroken and crate trained. Rudy\u2019s ideal home would be one where he is the only dog. He loves attention and does not want to share with anybody. A fenced in yard would also be nice. Rudy would like a family that has rottweiler experience and make a commitment to him.  Rudy would do well with children over the age of 10. \n\nIf you are interested in including RUDY in your home, please go to our website http://www.recycledrotts.org/wp/?page_id=150 for the rescue location, placement policies, placement fee and the link to our online application.",

She is crate trained and house broken. Etta was pulled from a local shelter needing help for her heartworm treatment. She has done fabulous. While we don't normally take bullies in a herding dog rescue, Etta sent out a special message and needed help. And now she is ready to continue her journey.

He had a check up at the vet and we did some bloodwork to make sure he wasn't fighting an infection we couldn't see and he is in perfect health! Also, by the grace of GOD he is heartworm negative!

I am a funny dude that would love someone to go on walks with, or play fetch with (I'm better at keep away right now), or just to sit with. I came from a hoarding situation so I'm a little timid but not too bad. I'm great with other dogs. My foster mom thinks I would do great with kids as well. I love to play and learning what is mine and what is yours but I'm still a puppy so I'll get there. I'm crate trained. I sleep through the night quietly in my crate. I'm working on the potty training but I'm so much better than I was a couple of weeks ago. I'm a super duper pup trying to find my family!

The staff at Pet Helpers and friends in the community searched long & hard for me and it worked! After several weeks of decompression, I am finally ready to begin my next chapter. I'm 11 months old, and still on the skinny side at around 30lbs. I'm still really shy with humans but have gotten so close with a lot of my dog friends here. They help bring out my playful carefree side. I'm going to need  help to learn how to be a confident dog once I'm at home, but with some time and patience I will try to be your best pal! The girls at the shelter will be here to help you and me through things to make sure everything goes great for us. To ensure this, we will schedule several meet and greets at the shelter to answer any questions and go over training tips, and proper handling to set us both up for success!",

He is good around the other dogs and he loves to scratch my back if I\u2019m sitting down.  \n\nIf you are interested in adding Barkley to your family, please go to our website and complete an application for adoption.   www.chloespetrescue.org/application\n\nHis adoption fee of $225, includes all his vetting (neuter, vaccinations and heartworm treatment).\n",

Ringo has adjusted very nicely with us, but we feel it's time for him to find his final forever home. Ringo is a 12 year old, 68 lb, Carolina Dog AKA an American Dingo. That's right! Ringo is a Dingo, and whether that was done on purpose or not, we think it suits him just fine.\n\nRingo lived with another dog his age who has since been adopted. He takes a while to warm up to a new person, but once he decides you're okay, he will reward you with letting you rub his oh-so-soft fur.\n\nRingo knows 'sit' and is working on 'down.' He has no leash manners, but we know once he settles into his new routine with his person, he will learn quickly. Like a true southern gentleman, Ringo prefers ambling in the yard as opposed to zoomying. He will bark in support of his zoomying friends, but Ringo is very much a spectator.\n\nRingo is scheduled to be neutered on January 28th, but we wanted to list him now because we would love for him to recover from his surgery in his new home.\n\nRingo has done well with dogs and has interacted favorably to cats and chickens. We think children would cause him to cower, so an adult home would be ideal.\n\nHe is up-to-date, but still needs to be neutered. His adoption fee is $250.",

I came to CCRC in bad shape with a bullet inside my arm from being shot. They got me the care I needed and now I'm ready to find my forever home! I would love a home without other animals or a calm dog that doesn't want to play. I am a chill dog BUT I LOVE GOING FOR WALKS! I'm an older dude with a young heart! I enjoy showing off what a smart boy I am by showing all the cute tricks I know (for treats of course). Please come meet me - fill out an application and someone will be in touch ASAP.\n\nWe do not have a facility for you to visit.\n\nWE PROCESS APPLICANTS AND SET APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THE ORDER APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED\n\n, so while you are welcome to email\nccrcdogs@ccrcdogs.com\nwith specific questions, you will want to complete the\n\nONLINE APPLICATION\n\nASAP\n\n,\n\nwhich can be found at www.ccrcdogs.com,\n\nto secure your position in line for one of our dogs. You can also find\n\na description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.",

Her name is BELLA, she is very sweet, loves to go on walks, friendly to all, but has always been an only dog, thus she needs to stay an only dog. Doesn't like other dogs to approach. She is spayed, up-to-date on all back scenes, and in great health. She could lose a couple pounds! Someone who would put her on the right diet of grain-free food and a few vegetables each day would be doing her a great favor. Right now she is active and very much a happy girl.

Jack Russell Terriers need homes with a secure fence.  Underground fencing is NOT safe for a  Jack Russell.  \n2. Jack Russell terriers are bred to be hunting dogs and are not suited to apartment or condo life.  The hunting instincts and prey drive cannot be trained out of  these terriers and they will stay active in this way all their lives.\n3. We do not adopt Jack Russell Terriers to families withe small children (under 6) as terriers are not patient with the antics of a small toddler.   \n4. Jack Russell Terriers can not safely coexist in a home with cats, birds, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, etc, as terriers were bred to hunt and can kill small animals.  They are hunters and they never give up. \n5. Please keep an open mind and consider your lifestyle both today and 10 years from now before you apply for a dog that may not be a good fit for the long run.",

She is still a youngster and loves to play - hard! She enjoys the company of other compatible dogs but we suggest no small dogs given her size and exuberance. She is learning manners and etiquette, including proper leash walking. She is respectful of the property and is not a chewer or a digger. Don't recommend toddlers Delilah may accidentally knock them over, she does weigh around 60lbs. She wants a family to be her best friends.If interested, please apply at www.adorepetrescue.org/adoption",

He was taken in initially due to a cruelty investigation after being rescued from a hoarding situation.  Sadly, until this time he hadn\u2019t had any socialization with humans and was considered semi-feral.\n\nHe was terrified of everyone and everything but the shelter staff could see he had potential.  After months of working with him and building his trust, he was making great strides.  Eventually, he became accustomed to his new routine at the shelter, enjoyed being petted and to expect his daily meals.\n\nWe learned about this boy and how far the shelter had come with him and decided collectively, that a foster home would be where he would continue to thrive until he was ready for his forever home.\n\nOur wonderful fosters, together with their special dog, have been working with Ducky for about a month now.   He has reached a point where we\u2019re ready to put him up for adoption with some very specific requirements.\n\nDucky\u2019s new adoptive family will need to be prepared to continue to work with him to overcome his fears and mistrust.  He is wonderful with humans once he gets to know them but is terrified of certain dogs.  \n\nHe will absolutely require a home with a docile, patient dog who is willing to continue to show him the ropes.  An intuitive dog, who can read Ducky well and know when to back off and give him his space.  He will also require a child-free, quiet home in the suburbs where there isn\u2019t too much commotion as he continues to gain his confidence and become the best dog he can be.\n",

This handsome pup is a 5-month-old mixed breed that weighs 35 lbs. He is super friendly and loving! He adores people and has yet to meet a pup he doesn\u2019t love. Hartley can be playful and spunky, which is balanced by his gentleness and well behaved nature. He does really well when on his own \u2014 he can be an independent player and snuggle up when it\u2019s time to chill. At the same time, he also enjoys playing with other pups. Typical for a pup his age, he lives for playtime with other pups but is still working on resting in the company of friends. If he\u2019s joining a pack, he\u2019d likely need a yard to get those excited wiggles out! Hartley is crate trained and potty trained and does well on the leash. He knows some of his basic commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d and is very smart and obedient. Hartley will thrive with an owner who is eager to continue building on the basics that he\u2019s mastered. If you\u2019re looking for a young pup to join your family, consider this sweet brindle boy! He is healthy, up to date on vaccines, chipped, and will be neutered by Wags & Walks. \n",

I tend to be shy at first and prefer to go home to a home with women. I need a little time to warm up but once I do you'll see I'm very loving. My ideal adopter would be one who knows a lot about my breed. I am very dog friendly and would love to go home with a new dog sibling. I would do best with children over the age of 16, I cannot live with cats. I'm looking for a fun and active home if you'd like to meet me please fill out an application and a Dog Adoption Counselor will contact you to schedule an appointment.",

This gorgeous little guy here is all that and a bag of chips but doesn't belong in a home with kids. He does really well in his foster home with other dogs and cats. Diego isn't a fan of strangers so a home with not many visitors is probably best for him. Diego loves to play but also loves to snuggle up with you under the covers. Diego is crate trained.  Only available to adopt in Michigan. NO PHONE CALLS OR TEXTS PLEASE. If interested in adopting Diego please apply at\nWWW.MARYTSCHIS.COM",

            "description": "Cremy is around 10 months old, weighs 50 lbs and was rescued from Puerto Rico. He should grow up to be a medium Sato, known for being extraordinarily loyal and loving dogs.\n\nHis foster mom reports: \n\nCremy is doing well.  He is playing in the snow and with the other dogs and toys.  I think a quiet house would be best for him.  He does have food aggression but not when being fed it\u2019s with treats (he won\u2019t eat them right away sometimes and will growl/snap at other dogs who try to get near it.  I have been able to take it away from him with no issues). He is also mouthy when playing but is getting better.\n\nThe only issue he has is he will bark/growl at strangers who come into the house then he will come and sit by me when they are here.  I\u2019m trying to work on that but between snow storm and COVID we have not had a lot of visitors.  Let anyone know he needs time to adjust to new people.  He would love someone who will snuggle on the bed or couch with him.\n\nI haven\u2019t had the chance to introduce them to kids.  But in my opinion Cremy would be a better fit for kids than Blanky. They have started crate training. \nThey get along well with other dogs, we have 3 little ones and they are super sweet and gentle with them.  No cats at home, but sometimes when they see a cat on the street when we are walking they bark like crazy. I think they are good with both men and women.\n\nIf you wish to meet them or find out more about them that is not included in their profile, please fill out our adoption application at http://bit.ly/PSDAdopt and our adoption counselor will contact you as soon as possible.\n\nIf they are listed on PetFinder, they have not yet been adopted. We take them off PetFinder when we have received enough applications, but that does not mean they have been adopted. \n\nWe do not know who the parents were nor what size they were, so we cannot tell you what breed they are nor what size they will eventually achieve.",

He would prefer a suburban life, without all the hustle, bustle, and noise of the big city. He was rescued from Puerto Rico, so he is a medium sized Sato, known for being extraordinarily loyal and loving dogs.\nHe is currently a little bit overweight and in the process of transitioning to a new food to shed some of those extra pounds. He is good with men and woman.  He is very calm in the home and just lounges around, but is more than happy to romp around the yard with dog friends. \nEco would do best living in a home without other dogs because he has shown resource guarding with his food ( only with dogs, not people ). Eco is good with other dogs in neutral settings (park, yard, playdates, etc.) and really enjoys playing with other dogs! He is totally fine socializing with other dogs out in the yard, on the leash, and does not guard his toys.  He can have furry friends come over as long as you make sure there is no food out.  \nRight now we are recommending a house with no kids for Eco as he has some chronic joint pain (arthritis) that can make him sensitive to the sudden or unpredictable movements small children often make. \nWe are looking for a dog experienced adopter who understands Eco and his needs, who will continue to help him shed his extra pounds (drop that pandemic weight!) and never let him be over weight again as it\u2019s crucial for him to stay thin with his arthritis and minor hip dysplasia. \n\nIf you wish to meet them or find out more about them that is not included in their profile, please fill out our adoption application at http://bit.ly/PSDAdopt and our adoption counselor will contact you as soon as possible.\n\nIf they are listed on PetFinder, they have not yet been adopted. We take them off PetFinder when we have received enough applications, but that does not mean they have been adopted.",

            "description": "Brutus is a big 95 pound boy. He is house trained and knows basic commands. He has some serious protective instincts and is probably going to think he is in charge until you teach him he isn't. He will do better with a female dog than a male. He loves people but is untested with kids. He is food motivated and learns quickly. He is used to being boarded and has been in doggy day care. He was given up by his owner though no fault of his own. Unfortunately due to some family health issues the owner has to travel and can't provide Brutus what he needs. He was very loved by his previous owner and will have an adjustment period to adapt to his new family including who is in charge.\n\nPriority will be given to adopter with German shepherd experience. For adoption success you will need large dog experience.\n\nAdopter must have a fenced yard, own their own home and have with an established vet. We will be taking applications and reviewing them closely over the next few weeks. A home visit will also be required before adoption can be complete. The first step in our adoption process is filling out our application completely.  https://graingercountyhumanesociety.org/available-dogs",

My owner passed away and I ended up in the shelter, and then I got saved and got to come to my goster mom's house. Now, after a while of going for walks and having swimming sessions, to get me some much needed excersize, I still wasn't losing weight. So, off to the vet we went for some tests. Come to find out, my thyroid wasnt working the right way, and now I'm on some medicine that will help that, and is pretty affordable. This means I can start losing weight now, and find a forever family to help me on this journey to a healthier me! I'm completely potty trained, so we could go for walks during potty time. At first they might be short walks, but soon I hope they can get longer. I'm good with dogs close to my size, medium to large dogs, but please make sure I don't have to share my food space, I like to eat in peace. I also like older children, the little ones are a bit too loud and active for me. I show interest in cats, although I'm not motivated enough to chase them, I'm unsure if I should live with them or not. I love humans and my foster mom says I'm a very sweet girl. I really enjoy getting affections from my family. I hope I can find a forever family soon, who will help me on this big journey I have ahead of me. They say slow and steady wins the race, and I'm ready to come in first place! Will you be next to me as I lose weight crossing the finish line?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

He isn't asking for much out of life, just a couple strolls through the park and a warm lap to rest his head on. He is a shy soul and is still learning to trust people since he was recently brought to us after being found in a hoarding situation. He would do best in a home that will be patient with him through his transition, a calm home environment would be ideal for him. He tends to be scared of most other dogs so he would do best as the only dog in the home.\n\nIf you would like to meet Timmy please fill out the adoption questionnaire found on our website www.owar.org",

He knows how to walk on his rear two legs and he also has wheels to help him get around.  He has life all figured out and doesn't let anything get him down.  Dan is super affectionate and eager to please.   He has a wonderful disposition and is described by all as a very special dog.  We think Dan  has the personality and temperament to be a service dog or an emotional support animal .   We know that with the right owner and the opportunity Dan is going to find his purpose.

For that reason, formal applications will be given priority over the aforementioned.***\n\nThe adoption fee for dogs 6 months and older is $150; this includes the spay/neuter, microchip, and current vaccinations as of the date of adoption.\n\nHazel is a sweet, young lab mix who loves belly rubs, treats, playing with her fur friends and lots of activity.  She is very timid with new people until she gets to know them but is friendly once she does.  She is a quiet girl who would be happiest with an active adopter who will continue her leash training for lots of walks (runs?) and who has a lot of love to give this shy sweetheart.  If she has access to a yard, it must be securely fenced because she can jump a 4 foot fence.\n\nAdoption Process:\n1. Submit Application\n2. Interview\n3. Home Check\nand Vet Check\n4. Meet the Pet\nMeet and Greet and begin 1 week sleepover",

We are arranging transport and will know more about him once he arrives and we assess him.  We do know he is a young adult, very people oriented and friendly.  He is an extreme escape artist so will not be a dog that can be left in a backyard unattended!  He has lots of energy and is very smart so might do well in dog sports.  We are guessing he has border collie in him and something much smaller.  He weighs about 10lb.  We will update once Sammy arrives after neuter on 2/3.\nUpdate: We have several good applications for Sammy and will not be accepting more at this point.  We want to assess him before making a final placement.",

He walks well on a leash and knows some basic commands.  Buddy is just the perfect age where he is settled but not yet ready to sleep all day by the fire.  He loves to go for walks and spend time with people.  Buddy is healthy--neutered, HW negative, completely vaccinated and ready to move on to a forever home.

We would like them adopted together. They have already lost their loved one (a family member is now caring for them while we look for a home) and we don't want them to lose each other.\n\nBoth dogs are spayed/neutered and up to date on shots (last vet visit was June 2020).\n\nGinger is a Chihuahua mix and weighs about 9 pounds. She is 10 years old. if you are gone for an extended time and leave a puppy pad out for her, she knows to use it.  She likes sitting by her human.\n\nBenji is a Maltese mix and weighs about 18 pounds. He's 12 years old. He is also house trained but needs a puppy pad left out just in case if you're gone an extended period of time.\n\nThis sweet pair needs a family who can give them love, care and be there for them in their golden years. The family said they mind well and would like do fine in a family with children or a single person or couple. \n\nThere is a $100 rehoming fee for the pair.  If they are not microchipped, we will have that done prior to going to their new home.\n\n",

I love to snuggle and have the softest coat of fur. I\u2019m mostly relaxed but do get excited to play outside with my fur foster brother (although I\u2019m a lot more low key than he is). I\u2019m crate trained, house trained, and am gentle with my human foster baby. I\u2019m learning to walk on a leash but am not a puller. I love to wander and sniff. Will you bring me home to be your new snuggle buddy? He is heartworm positive and being treated by rescue.",

For over four years, Duke enjoyed a wonderful relationship with a lady who gave him a great home. Sadly, Duke\u2019s former mom is very ill now and can no longer care for him, so he is back with us and looking for his next big adventure! He is a great, fun little pooch who needs a dog-savvy owner capable of setting boundaries for him and giving him much-needed exercise, as he loves to take walks! And, psssssst \u2026Duke is a lady\u2019s man so prefers humans of the female persuasion! Duke has some special medical needs that can be easily managed in his next home. He must be the only pet and, sorry, no children. For more information about this sweet, white fluff ball, contact me, Stacey, at stacey.doan@poainc.org.

She is a perfect 30 pound size. We think she could learn to trust and enjoy people. We have some great volunteers that could give you lots of guidance if you are willing to give this girl a chance. She will have her spay surgery soon then her adoption can be completed.

Genelle just had 6 puppies and is a wonderful, attentive mother. She loves to play and snuggle and she is very loyal and happy. We believe she came from a rough living situation; she was very scared of us and protective of her babies. Within a few days of living in a loving home, Genelle now follows us around, sits on our laps, and loves to roll over and show us her belly when we talk to her! She is now so sweet and gentle and smiles at us. Genelle is looking for a loving and patient family, who will give this precious girl a happy forever home.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\nNote: Some apartments and neighborhoods have breed restrictions.

She weighs 30 lbs. now so we believe she will be a medium sized dog when grown.\n\nMarlo gets along fabulously with the other dogs here at the rescue.  If you are looking for a new family member that is FUN then Marlo is your girl.  She loves to snuggle and just be with you but is active and loves to play.  So sweet & happy all the time.\nGREAT will all other dogs. \n\nOh, and simply one beautiful pup! Her coat is gorgeous.   The foster family is working on her potty training & she is 90% there.  \n\nIf you are interested in giving Marlo a wonderful home, go to our Facebook page and download the application from the notes section. While you are there, please Like our page to see our new available dogs and keep up with upcoming events.\n\nHere is the link: www.facebook.com/pages/MAR-Mercer-Animal-Rescue-501c3/374149832631589\n\nThe application can also be downloaded from our website www.merceranimalrescue.org\n\nYou can also email us at merceranimalrescue@gmail.com and we will email an application to you.\n\nMarlo\u2019s adoption donation is $525 which helps to cover her spaying, micro-chipping puppy shots, bordetella (kennel cough), rabies, heart worm prevention, flea/tick prevention, vet examination, certificate of health and transport fee. \n\nALL OUR DOGS START THEIR JOURNEY IN TENNESSEE\n\nMarlo is fostered in Tennessee and will travel to her new family once she has been adopted.  \n\nWe make weekly trips to Chicago to bring the adopted dogs to to their new homes in the Illinois & Wisconsin areas.  The next transport to Chicago is Friday, January 22, 2021.  \n \nOur primary source of funding comes from this adoption donation.

            "description": "Hi there world, I'm Titan. I'm a black male pitbull pup and I'm about 18 weeks old or so. And I am currently looking for my furever home! I am a little ball of energy, so far weighing in at about 25 lbs or so. My foster mom thinks I will get pretty big but I don't remember much about my real mom and dad so we really can't say. Mommy just judges by my feet, or something like that she said. How weird huh? Anyway though, back to me. I love outside time and playing, and I love my foster siblings! I get along great with my dog brother and sister and I like picking on my kitty sisters, but mommy teaches me that I can't be too rough with them, so I know I have to be sweet in the end. I also love my human little brother. He's still really young so mom doesn't let me play with him too too much but I love every second of it when I do get to! I also love my foster mom and dad! Dad is the best though, since I never get in any kinda trouble with him! Lol. I love mommy too of course, but she tells me when I'm being bad so dad is secretly my favorite! Just don't tell mom! I am crate trained and working on house training. I am getting better with house trainng but I'm still learning, especially being able to hold it in the crate at night. I also love nap time and cuddling on the couch with my humans. It's the best. But like I said before, outside is where I'm most happy and spunky! Overall I am a great pup and I just need someone who will love me and teach me things. Oh yeah, and I need someone who will be okay with me having a small medical issue. I have something that they call \"\"demodectic mange\"\". Don't worry, it's not your typical contagious mange that's scary and makes all my hair fall out. My foster mom says this is something that I was born with that was passed to me either through my mom or dad, so it's nothing I can help or change. But mom says it's easily controlled/managed with a liquid medicine that I take by mouth just once daily, and it's not too expensive, so don't stress over that! (Oh, and where you see my hair missing on my leg in my pictures, it's not from the mange. I recently had a small stay at the vet's office and I had to have an IV put in, so they had to shave my hair! But no worries. It will grow back in no time and I'll be as cute as ever!) If you will help me get all the care and love that I need and deserve, I promise to return the favor with furever love, cuddles, licks, naps, walks, and so much more! Please adopt me today!\n\nIf you are interested in giving Titan a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal.

We rescued Li'l Abby, her Momma and siblings, from a risky, dangerous life on the streets of Texas where they were huddled together in the dirt trying to keep warm. That's no life for a dog, much less a puppy, so we picked them all up and now Li'l Abby is on her way to the happy, loving life she deserves. Li'l Abby is sweet, adorable, playful and happy.

She is great with other \ndogs and excellent with cats (no opportunity to test with children). She is initially shy but once comfortable is an excellent couch companion and very outgoing. She is still working on leash manners but is very house trained and has shown no signs of food aggression. \n\nHer foster says she needs to drive her around in the car a bit to get her a little more comfortable with that, but she is becoming more & more comfortable on a leash. She would do well with another dog as a companion. It's still a bit difficult to get her really interested in forward motion if there isn't a second dog to interact with. Her foster also reports her greetings are hilarious! She shows her teeth and closes her mouth loudly (I'd not call it a 'snap' though). And her tail tries to greet you at the same time her tongue does. So cute & funny!\n\nMatilda is up to date on all her shots & has been spayed & microchipped.\n\nFor more information, please contact Susan at daiseymaggie@yahoo.com.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that April is 3 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. April is good with people and other dogs. Life on the rough streets of Texas is hard enough, but not only was April desperately trying to survive, she had a litter of puppies who she was trying to keep safe. AND April had a mangled leg which had become infected causing her severe pain. April was not going to survive. Day after day people walked past April, her puppies and her injury, until one day a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC volunteer walked past and stopped. April and her puppies are now Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pups and their lives have taken a drastic turn for the better. April is at our veterinary partner receiving specialty treatment for her injury, and she will soon be ready to breathe a sign of relief in her forever home and start living the pampered life she was destined to live. If you can welcome April with open arms and never stop loving her, please apply online to adopt April (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Luckily, I have successfully completed my treatment and I am ready for my fur-ever home.\n\nI would be the best fit with someone looking for a companion as I love being right by my human's side. I like other dogs, but I'm happiest when the attention is all on me and I don't have to share my toys or treats. (Absolutely no cats for me.) I'm an easy walker and I do well in public and love to go wherever my human goes.\n\nI am okay around children, but it would be best if you didn't have any younger kids. I can be protective of them and I do not like when they are picked up.\n\nI am mostly calm throughout the day; my foster parents work from home and I love keeping watch over them to make sure they are getting their work done. When I'm not busy making sure my foster parents are working, I love chewing on bones or taking a nice long nap. I enjoy watching tv as I've never seen it before, and it makes a lot of funny noises.\n\nI do require some special medication and food in order to keep me healthy, as I have some skin and food allergies. I cannot have poultry, but I have done well with a single source protein diet, such as, beef or lamb. My foster parents or the shelter can point you in the right direction for food. Something else that helps me stay healthy is a dose of Apoquel daily. This medication keeps me from itching all day long and lets me focus on what I do best - naps and chewing on bones.\n\nJake's adoption fee is fully sponsored, and he is neutered, microchipped and current on all vaccines.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org/applications and fill out an online application.",

            "description": "Hey it\u2019s me Cerberus and I weigh 103 lbs! \nI like long walks on the beach and .... just kidding but I do like going for walks. I like to walk right beside my person when I\u2019m on a leash because it\u2019s too hard to pull them around everywhere (and besides, my foster brother\u2019s got that one covered).  I am also really good at staying with my hoomans when I don\u2019t have a leash on.  It\u2019s nice when I get to run ahead a bit but they\u2019re slow so I come back to make sure they\u2019re staying beside me! Also, wherever I am in the house or outside as soon as I hear my person make a noise, even if it\u2019s not my name, I go see what they need. \nI looooooove getting pets, but ONLY from my person/people.  If I don\u2019t know you I\u2019ll get scared and I\u2019m not really sure why.  It took a day or two for them to trust me and me to trust them, I guess I kinda like when people play hard to get.  After they ignored me for a bit I decided they were ok and I would try to cuddle with them because that\u2019s what I really want.  Now I\u2019m so glad they still want to pet me even after I snapped because I think it\u2019s my favourite thing! \nI usually get extra goodies on my breakfast which I think is great! Apparently it\u2019s to help get muscles on my back legs. Maybe it\u2019ll help me when I need to turn quick, because sometimes my feet get tangled now. \nAnother thing I love is car rides! I get so excited when I hear the keys jingle, it\u2019s sooo relaxing, I just find a spot near the back window to lay down and I stay there until it\u2019s time to get out. \nI am already around 7 years old so even though I like being outside, I don\u2019t have as much energy as those crazy puppies so it\u2019s nice when we can just lay around the house too!  I am really good in the house. I find my spot and lay down when you\u2019re busy, but if you\u2019re not I\u2019ll come over for cuddles. I am fully house trained.  The first couple days in my foster house I was stressed out and I didn\u2019t know how to say I needed to go out so I had a couple accidents but i haven\u2019t done that since the first day.  \nI really like my foster brother and want to play but I think he\u2019s scared of me because I\u2019m so big.  I don\u2019t really know how to ask him to play because I didn\u2019t grow up with dogs.  I\u2019ve found out that toys are really fun though! \nI\u2019ve met a bunch of dogs so far and I just sniff them and continue what I\u2019m doing.  There was one dog who stressed me out but he was super hyper and wouldn\u2019t stop bugging me to play with him.  I don\u2019t get mad though I just found a spot away from him. \nIm good with cats and was ok with the shitzu I met. I tried to sniff her and she nipped my nose. \n\nI don\u2019t like new people touching me and will let you know when I\u2019m comfortable with touch. I do have a bite history but I am not mean, I was simply scared and confused. \n\nMy foster mom says I\u2019m a king, I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m super important and she gives me treats and toys and loves me, it might be because of the kind of dog I am too, I might be mixed with other things but I look mostly like a king shepherd.  \nI am really big and can be clumsy so it would be best if I don\u2019t go to a house with kids. \n\nCerberus is a gentle giant, but requires patience at first.  He is known to nip at hands and does not like being pet until he fully trusts you. If you are the right person for Cerberus, it will be important to let other people know not to put their hands out towards him.  He doesn\u2019t mind being walked by new people, or having other people in the house, he\u2019d just prefer to be ignored by everyone other than his trusted people or person.  He is up to date on his shots and was very recently neutered. He will be your best friend, he just needs someone who will commit to giving him a couple days to get used to new people and places.\n\n4champanimalrescue.com",

            "description": "Meet Opal!\n\nOpal is such a sweetheart and loves everyone she meets!    She knows to sit for treats, she is a smart girl and eager to please. Opal has been in the shelter since 6/19/2020.  Opal needs to be an only pet, she does not get along with other dogs and will not be cat friendly.   She loves attention and will be a fantastic companion to a lucky family.  She has a routine of coming into the office daily when she gets walked, she knows where the treat bowl is at and comes in and waits for her treat.\n\nOpal would be best in a home with older children or only adults as she tends to jump and does not know her size.  She just needs a loving family that will be willing to work with her on her manners. \n\nOpal weighs 65 lbs, she has been spayed, she is heartworm free, current on all of her vaccinations, flea/tick prevention, and she is microchipped. \n\nOpal stays in a shelter in Mississippi, she is available for a virtual meet and greet as well as more videos and photos are available upon request.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

They are good with children, cats, take baths well and are house and lease trained.\n\nThey enjoy spending as much time as possible with their humans, cuddling up with them in their laps or taking naps, sharing treats and loves. Both are very lovable and caring and give you as much attention as you give them, and let you know when they feel neglected.\n\nThey were a little unsure and scared when in a new home, but quickly make themselves at home and become part of the family. They will make good family or single person companions leaving you feeling extremely loved.\n\nIf you are interested in Mia and Bigge - please complete the online adoption application via the link below so that the foster parent can reach out to you directly.\n\nhttps://www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/applications/adoption-application/\n\nthank you for your interest in rescuing!",

He was very scared in the shelter because he did not know why he was taken from a warm bed to a cold floor.   Low Riders was asked to take him in and we did.  He is just adorable and in need of a loving home.  Henry does well with other dogs and would make a great addition to any family.  He loves people and likes to hang out with his human. Let\u2019s help Bandit find a home so he can feel warm and loved and safe.  If you would like to open your hearts and home to Bandit please fill out an application at\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nBandit\u2019s adoption fee is $376.00 - he is neutered, up to date on all his vaccinations and chipped.",

            "description": "Diamond came to us from a shelter in North Carolina. She was found as a stray so we don\u2019t know her history. However, she was clearly someone\u2019s indoor pet as she knows what a couch is and wants to snuggle with her people.  She is also fully housebroken and also does not try to take things off of counters.  She loves to be pet and will nudge people when they stop petting her, as if to say, \u201cHey, Keep going!\u201d  She is super quiet and for that reason is a great option for a family that lives in a condo or townhouse type of setting.  She rarely makes a sound!  She does not require a fenced yard as she is perfectly content burning off energy by playing with her stuffed toys.  By playing with them, that means shredding them and pulling all the stuffing out.  Once the toy is de-stuffed, she will toss around the remains of her stuffie as if it is a new toy.  She is currently being leash walked to go potty in a yard a few times a day, then getting a walk of about 20 minutes at night and that is perfectly fine with Diamond.  She does not need a big yard to exercise in.\n\nShe is a big, strong girl who is estimated to be about 3 years old.   She does not realize how big and clumsy she is and for that reason she is likely not a fit for a home with young kids.  She also is not a great leash walker and thinks that when out on her potty walks at night she is supposed to zigzag her way up the street, pulling in every direction.  She is super strong but is expected to learn to walk better on her walks with practice and time.  She loves going for car rides and would make a great road tripping companion.\n\nThe shelter had taken her into the room where the cats were housed and she was described as curious, especially when a cat was trying to paw at her.  Her current foster home does not have any cats so they have not been able to more thoroughly see how she reacts to a cat. However, on a walk she did see an outdoor cat and was excited, but in a playful way. As for dogs, she definitely seems like she wants to play, but she is somewhat overly excited when first seeing other dogs, and the other dogs that she has encountered seem to be taken back by her over exuberant way of wanting to meet. For that reason, we think that most dogs may not be as fond of her as she seems to want to be of them.  That is just fine with Diamond as she is perfectly happy hanging with her people at home and not necessarily needing a canine companion.",

            "description": "What a good old boy Riley is.  He was abandoned at a nearby Vet Clinic who asked us for help.   Riley is now in one of our fosters homes having a really good time.  He is approx. 9-10 years old and a strong 68 lbs.   He is very leery of men but will be working with a more men soon to come of his shell and build more trust.  He will just cower in fear and try and retreat from men he meets at first.  But with some chicken and steak he is learning that guys are not so bad.   Riley would do best in a quiet home where he can settle himself and get all the love and snooze time he deserves.   He is good with other dogs in playgroups at his current foster home but if a dog confronts him or gets an attitude with him he will not back down.  Therefore we prefer a home where he can be the only dog. Adoption fee 100.00",

            "description": "Toby is 4 months old and weighs about 32 pounds.  Toby came into our rescue from animal control as a stray.  Toby is such a sweet puppy.  He loves to play, loves to sleep with you on the couch.  He is going to be a wonderful boy for any family.  Toby does have a right front deformity in leg but it does not affect him at all.  He plays and runs.  He has seen two vets and there is nothing that can be done.  Toby is a love and not a hyper puppy.  He goes outside and does his duty.  He could use some continued basic obedience training.  He knows how to sit and takes treats gently.  Toby would probably do best in a home with a yard and another dog.\n\nToby's adoption fee includes his/her 1st grooming/bath, spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccinations, fecal, heartworm tests, flea/tick treatment if required, microchip, collar, and any other vet care that's required during his/her stay with us.  Adoption Donation is:  $400\n\nPlease fill out an application at cryforhelprescue.com if you are interested in meeting Toby.\n\nSee all our adoptable dogs and fill out an online application now at http://www.cryforhelprescue.com.

Prior to this, we were best buddies and did everything together, so as you might guess, I'm feeling a little lost with all the recent changes in my life. To add insult to injury, I've also tested positive for heartworm, and I will receive treatment for this. I'm a really sweet girl who seems to do fine with other dogs. More info to come as I settle in. The rescue is hoping that there's a special adopter out there who will provide me with a quiet setting and leash walks until my heartworm treatment is complete. If you're that special person, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application. My adoption fee is $350.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

            "description": "**MIA AND BIGGIE are BONDED and must be adopted together**\n\nMia and Biggie are middle aged dogs with lots of energy and life waiting to be enjoyed with a new family in their forever home. They are good with children, cats, take baths well and are house and lease trained.\n\nThey enjoy spending as much time as possible with their humans, cuddling up with them in their laps or taking naps, sharing treats and loves. Both are very lovable and caring and give you as much attention as you give them, and let you know when they feel neglected.\n\nThey were a little unsure and scared when in a new home, but quickly make themselves at home and become part of the family. They will make good family or single person companions leaving you feeling extremely loved.\n\nIf you are interested in Mia and Bigge - please complete the online adoption application via the link below so that the foster parent can reach out to you directly.\n\nhttps://www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/applications/adoption-application/\n\nthank you for your interest in rescuing!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nIf you are reading about Wilson on a website other than Bfpa.org, please go directly to Bfpa.org since it will tell you more about him than what is listed on other adoption sites. All dogs posted on our website ARE available.\n\nYou MUST submit an application at\n\nBFPA.org\n\nif you are interested in Wilson!\n\nFOSTER COMMENTS:\n\nWilson is a 55-60lb German Shepard mix, whose favorite things to do are, sleep, sunbathe and take car rides! He is estimated to be about 8 years old.\n\nWilson is very chill. He does whine when he sees other dogs and doesn't get along with all dogs. He probably would do best being an only dog in a home where a human is home most of the time\n\nHe had not been exposed to cats prior to his foster placement with us. When he first arrived he was curious and approached with ease. He still demonstrates an interest in \"checking her out\" every so often when she is in proximity.\n\nWe do not have young children, our youngest is 19. In general, I have not noticed any nervous tendencies with people, and I think Wilson would be fine with children.\n\nWilson is house trained, and we take him out every few hours. While we have a crate for him, we have not used it with him because he has great house manners. When we leave the house he has remained out of a crate with our other 2 dogs in the house. There have been no issues and at this point, we have been away as long as 3 to 3 1/2 hours. At night, Wilson sleeps on his dog bed on the floor of our room right next to his foster sister and brother. Wilson has gone about 10 hours through the night and a few 6 hour stretches during the day. He is not a great fan of the rain, so he has chosen to hold himself until it stops or is a little less heavy. He also recently demonstrated a need to go out to the bathroom by waiting at the door we use to go out.\n\nWilson is pretty low key. He likes to spend time outdoors \"hanging out\" and enjoying the sun. A fenced yard is required for Wilson so that he is able to hang out, enjoy the weather and have some playtime with a human or dog friend. He tends to spend a big part of his day sleeping. He does like a walk but doesn't demand one. Wilson walks very well in his harness on a leash. However, when he can become fixated on a scent or a dog in his vicinity. He doesn't want to keep walking and sometimes requires moving him away from the fixation.\n\nWilson is a great dog and needs an equally great forever home. He does enjoy his human companionship and often stays nearby, either on a his comfy dog bed, an office chair with a view, or even cozying up next to you on the couch! Wilson is a very sweet, handsome, easy going boy who needs a forever home to call his own.\n\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Wilson was found as a stray and taken to a rural shelter. No one claimed him so BFPA was happy to admit him into our rescue. BFPA is now trying to find the perfect home for him. Does your home sound like the perfect one?\n\nSome of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based on our expertise and is not guaranteed.\n\nApplicants must live no further than one hour from Cary NC as our dogs must be seen by a BFPA veterinarian for all medical care prior to adoptions being finalized. Our foster guardians deliver dogs to their new homes for adoption trials and we do home visits to finalize all adoptions. We therefore require applicants to live within an hours drive of Cary NC.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING WILSON ?

Spot is 6 years old and was rescued years ago off the war-torn streets in that area.   He comes to us now for finding his forever home in the United States.  Adoption fee 200.00 - ******UPDATE 1/27 FROM FOSTER PARENTS:  Spot is learning to do his business outside and doing well.  He is very leary of having his neck touched and having a collar put on him.   This is probably b/c he was just with a pack of dogs never on leash at the shelter he came from for so many years.  He is timid with new people and surroundings but adjusting well slowly but surely.\nA fenced in yard is needed for him and an adult only home with possibly only older teenagers due to his timid nature and being hand shy.  Prior dog ownership required and a laid back more submissive dog as a companion would be good for him.  We were told at the Nowzad shelter that he liked to be the dominant dog.",

            "description": "So let's first address the elephant in the room...This boy's ears were mutilated and up until rescue, he was treated like garbage. He was picked up wandering the road by a nice police officer who took him to a small, neighboring municipal shelter, where he first received care. He was defeated, severely emaciated (see photo of him wearing a harness), scarred and terrified. The shelter reached out to us and it was there he earned the name Cowboy, because cowboys have to be tough, especially when no one is looking.\n\nAfter a brief stint at the vet, Cowboy gained some weight, was neutered and made up to date on all shots. He is now in foster care where he quickly learned that he enjoys a nice, soft place to lay, he will never again go hungry, and the backyard is for playing or simply hanging out with friends. Even though his advocates are dismayed by his past mistreatment, Cowboy harbors no ill-will toward anyone and is just about the sweetest boy we have ever met.\n\nCowboy would do great in just about any home but we are not sure he is appropriate with small kids and/or cats because he has not been observed in that situation. Cowboy is still gaining weight and will get bigger, although he seems unaware of his large size. Cowboy requires a quiet place to eat and a slow feeder bowl. That's about the extent of the special care he'll need. He is crate/doggy door trained, and gets along with other dogs with proper introduction. He is learning simple commands but sometimes gets over excited at treat time so he just needs to be reminded to be \u201dnice\u201d. We think Cowboy is about one and half years old so he still has a little playful pup in him. He wants to please though so he is receptive to positive reinforcement-type training.\n  \nCowboy is a quiet chap but will alert you of any unknown sounds. He loves to just hang out and chill after some exercise. Have you ever wanted a dog as a best friend? A dog that will follow you everywhere and dote on you?  A dog that wants to be close to you as you sleep? Watch a movie? Do laundry, wash dishes, etc...? How about a dog that snores?  He has the cutest snore and we especially love his liver colored nose! Cowboy's eyes are dreamy too and almost match his coat, which feels like velvet. We hope that one day his velvety fur will grow in enough to help cover his scars.\n\nWe know that his adopter will be unfairly saddled with a sort of stigma attached to his appearance. We also know, from experience, that adopters of previously mutilated dogs like Cowboy are accepting of that burden and often, unintentionally serve as an ambassador for the breed and rescue in general. The reward though, is having such a loyal, true blue friend that thinks you hang the moon. With that, you have Cowboy.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as an adoption candidate, please submit an application through our website. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nwww.NinjaPawsRescue.org\n",

I love chewing on my toys, I'm learning to fetch, and enjoy a daily visit or two to the dog park (where I am working on my socialization skills). I adore naps, snuggles, belly rubs and am happy for attention from kids and adults alike.\n\nI am kenneled trained but do fine when left out alone. I am also house trained and can make it through the night without having to go out. I love meal time (and treats) and will hang with you whenever you are in the kitchen - but I really don't \"beg\" for food.\n\nI hope for a home where people are around a lot and can find time throughout the day to play, rub and snuggle with me. A home with another dog would be great (I am not sure about cats as I don't have much experience with them, but my fosters think I would be okay because I'm so chill). Apply today to meet me!\n\nDate of birth (estimated):\n7/10/20\n\nGood with Dogs: Yes\n\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nHouse Trained: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee:\n\n$500\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting this animal, please read the following before submitting an adoption application on our website - fureverhomerescue.com.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, 4Dx test (covers tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis , Lymes, Ehrlichiosis) as well as heart worm) & de-worming. We ask that our dogs live indoors unless otherwise stated & agreed upon. Applicants must live in MN within a reasonable distance from the Twin Cities Metro Area. We do not adopt out of state.",

They would have gone with her but the facility had a weight restriction and  Juliet and Binky are too big. So they are in foster care until another great home can be found. They are well trained and healthy. Binky is the more confident of the Two. Juliet is shy and a little more anxious about the change but she is coming around. They spend most of their day basking in the sun. They have lived with another dog but have not met new dogs for awhile so a dog introduction is important.",

I seem very interested in other dogs but it is unknown how I do with them. I am meet and greet required which means I must meet any dogs in the household prior to adoption. It is unknown how I do with children. I have been described to be a happy fun guy who is very food motivated. I also have the most adorable squishy face! *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

You may notice I walk funky sometimes- this is because of my neurologic deficit suspected to be from a previous injury. However, I am not in pain and I'm still such a big goofball! I would love a place to call home with a couch to crash on. I'm OK with other dogs, but would probably do best with a female. I take correction well and learn quickly from my furry friends. I will need a family willing to have a working relationship with a primary care vet to ensure I continue to be the perfect boy I am and in tip-top shape! Ask to meet me today! I may just steal your heart. \n\n\nGoofballI'm a fun-loving, happy-all-the-time, glass-is-half-full kind of dog looking for someone who loves to laugh and play around. Must have a great sense of humor and a bunch of tennis balls. \n Primary Color: Brown Weight: 70lbs Age: 4yrs 4mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "All ARCBCR dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on all vaccines, heartworm negative and on preventative, dewormed and on flea and tick preventative before going to their forever homes.If interested in this pup, please fill out an online application on our website, www.arcbcr.org, and an ARC volunteer will contact you regarding your home evaluation to see if you and this pet are a good match.Please consider making a donation to help the ARCBCR Border Collies.  ARCBCR is a 501(c)3 organization making your donation eligible as a tax deduction.  \n\nAdoption Application: http://www.arcbcr.org/apply-to-adopt/\n\nMeet Jingle! Jingle is a sweet, handsome Border Collie/Lab mix that is approximately 1 year old and weighs about 37 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Jingle\u2019s past, but we think he probably didn\u2019t have the best life before becoming part of the ARCBCR family. ARCBCR first learned of Jingle when he was dumped, by his previous family, in a rural, high-kill shelter in NC. Jingle was so terrified of people when he first arrived at his foster home, that he hid in his crate too terrified to stand or walk and had to be carried in and out of the house to potty.\u00a0\u00a0As terrified as he might have been, he tolerated every new and frightening interaction and never exhibited a single sign of aggression, a true sign of just how sweet his temperament is. Jingle now confidently trots out to play in the yard with his foster brothers and sisters. After a good romp he is happy to return inside to settle with a chew bone or take a nap.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJingle is initially a shy but friendly fellow and is still learning that humans are kind and being pet is enjoyable. He is nervous in new situations and around new people but will slowly but surely warm up especially if treats are involved. Jingle has recently started greeting his foster mom with tail wags and flopping over for belly rubs. He has gone from hiding in his crate to happily following his foster mom from room to room, curious as to what fun they will find next. He is a bit of an expert at social distancing as he enjoys being in the same room with his people, just 3\u2019 apart.\u00a0\n\nJingle has learned that toys and balls are fun to play with and loves a good wrestling match with his foster brothers and sisters. He has also learned that the sound of the refrigerator door opening means all the good things! Some of his favorite treats are raw carrots, pineapple, and ice cubes!\u00a0\n\nJingle is house trained; crate trained and is learning to walk on a leash. On the rare occasion that he\u2019s up to something naughty, a sharp \u201cNo\u201d is all it takes to get his attention and redirect him. He still has some puppy tendencies like stealing dirty laundry, digging holes, and if you\u2019ve left something tasty too close to the edge of the counter, he will surely find it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJingle has come a long way in his foster home, and we\u2019ve promised to find him the perfect forever home with a lifetime of love and gentle care. \n\nFor that reason, he has some requirements for his new home. \n\n\u2022 \u00a0A home with a fully fenced yard, no apartments, and no electric fences. \n\n\u2022 A friendly canine buddy to romp with. A dog the same size or larger will be required as he gets rough sometimes and a smaller dog may get hurt. \n\n\u2022 A quieter home without a lot of comings and goings.\n\n\u2022 A family that is home more often than not. \n\n\u2022 A home with no children or age 10 or older.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJingle will need a forever family that realizes he is a work-in-progress and is willing to gently and patiently continue to build his trust. He plays \u201chard-to-get\u201d but earning his love and affection is worth the effort and wait. We feel confident that with continued love and patience, Jingle will be able to let go the hurt of his past and move on to being a happy, well-adjusted, and confident boy!\u00a0\n\nJingle is neutered, up to date on vaccines and is microchipped. He is being fostered near Charlotte, NC.",

LOOK AT THAT ADOGABLE FACE AND THOSE EARS HEAR EVERYTHING YOU SAY! Meet SOOKIE, a 5 month old, 42lb, Shepherd/hound looking for a new forever home with an active, experienced dog guardian, a fun-loving friendly, confident male resident dog and a large fenced in yard where they can romp and play. Her current family rescued her several months ago from a breeder situation where she was confined to a crate 24/7. Although they adore her and she knows it, she's too much puppy for their 3 y/o child and the senior dogs. She asked us to help her rehome Sookie with a family that will love her to the moon and back and give her the great life she deserves.\n\nSOOKIE is a high energy pup who loves to play, eat and sleep and play some more. She is very smart, and highly treat and praise motivated so she responds well to force free or positive reinforcement training. She will need ongoing training and lots of playtime. Her guardian shares the following:\n\n\"Sookie is a very sweet, friendly, affectionate, loving, energetic, sometimes vocal pup. She is the smartest dog I've ever met. I took her to one training class and they had her paying attention and listening to basic commands on the first try. She loves her Kong toy and will chew it for hours. She loves to run and play. She will wrestle with my lab mix all day if he lets her. She's housebroken and crate trained. She is a puppy who wants what she wants and can still be bossy about it. She loves to dig and will chew anything she can find if not supervised. Sookie is so smart. We've been working on good house and people and dog manners and she's making progress but will need an experienced guardian willing to continue with training and get her to the finish line. She is going to make someone a fabulous dog. I can't tell you enough how smart she is.... with the right guardian, she could excel in any dog sport and learn every trick in the book. She's just a wonderful pup who deserves an awesome home with someone who will give her a great life.\"\n\nSOOKIE is up to date on age-appropriate shots. She is not spayed. Her adoption fee is $575. which includes a spay/neuter fee. Please note that training is highly recommended for all young dogs.\n\nAs with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing. Visit WWW.LULUSRESCUE.ORG for an overview of Lulu's Rescue adoption process.\n\nThanks for adopting and saving a life!",

She loves to sniff and track any cats that may have crossed her path on her walkies. Occasionally she'll let out a little howl to let the cats know that she is on to them and ready to play. Her favorite thing in the whole wide world is treats, so try not to get between her and her snacks! While you're a close second to what she loves the most, she will let you know just how important her treats are and will show off by spinning on her hind legs until you toss a treat her way. She also finds treasure in other's trash, but as long as her sniffer is out of trash's way she will be the cleanest dog you ever did meet. She loves to take naps on the sofa while her human is away, but will be ready to cuddle and play fetch as soon as you return.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

            "description": "Dashwood, or as we refer to him as Dash, was dumped on the Haven road in a horrible, makeshift crate with his siblings. He is now the last of his siblings waiting on his forever home. Because he had such a rough start to life, he is still a bit timid towards humans. He, however, is very sweet and is a melt-in-your-hands type of dog. He does best with a doggy sibling who can help him come out of his shell. He has learned to walk on a leash and makes a great walking buddy. He is still young and is going to grow to be quite a large boy. Dashwood has a bit of separation anxiety and would like to be in a home where he can be with someone all of the time. We have had volunteers of all ages around Dashwood and he is patient and kind with all. He loves snacks, especially the bacon flavored ones! We are unsure if he is potty-trained but he has been in our office for a few hours with no accidents. Dashwood is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all shots. estimated date of birth is 10/17/19. Dash weighs 73lbs...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "Chadwick was adopted when he was a young puppy and the owner thought he was cute and adorable. He is STILL cute and adorable but his owner quickly tired of having a dog and didn't spend much time with Chadwick. He spent long days outdoors while she was at work. Sometimes she would just forget him outside all night. Finally she reached out for someone to take him. Poor little guy is VERY TIMID as he hasn't experienced much in life and has never known love and affection from a human. It took him several hours to stop shaking once he got to his foster mom's house. He is beginning to settle in and is very appreciate to have the basic comforts of a warm, soft bed, nutrious food, and affection. Chadwick is very nice to the other dog in the home and has shown his apprecation to his foster by being loving and well behaved. We think Chadwick is a Chihauhua mix. His foster family has 3 other small doggies ranging from 7 to 13 years old and he enjoys their companionship. No possessiveness of food or his people. He LOVES to be a lap dog so we would like to have someone who enjoys snuggles. He is house trained and knows how to use the doggie door.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $300 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

Before he came to us he had not met very many people in his life. He would greatly appreciate it if others could give him plenty of time to warm up to them. To be honest, he doesn't really like everyone he meets -- he's rather picky about humans and he is not tolerant of children. However, when he is around adults he likes then he becomes an adoring social butterfly. Just like his preference with people, Oreo also prefers only calm dogs. He would enjoy being your one and only dog, but could live with a well-matched dog friend (no cats, please!) Oreo is opinionated and well read so he hopes you enjoy random chit chats here and there. He loves walks in the park but also appreciates time to cuddle on the couch. He is always available to sample tasty snacks and is happy just to be with his person. Though he tries to hold up the reputation of a steady and well balanced gentleman, he gets lonely should you leave him so he would appreciate it if you had a more flexible schedule so he doesn't have to be alone for too long. Oreo promises to be a good co-worker and protector if you take him home. Does he sound like he has the potential to become your favorite cookie? Please inquire if you would like to join Oreo's friend circle!",

            "description": "Don't be late to acquaint with Tate. He's great! He's much better than our rhymes, at least! Tate is fun, goofy youngster who is also showing us quite a bit of intelligence. He's currently residing in an APA foster home and should be ready to make the transition to your home. Tate is a real people-lover. He especially loves to cuddle up with his favorite people, and put his head on your lap or feet. He likes to follow his fosters around the house so that he doesn't miss out on anything interesting. But he's also showed us signs of being a serious student. He's quickly learned commands such as stay, sit, lie down, stand up, turn around, back up, roll over, and look at me. He is treat-motivated so he's been easy to train. He also does well in a crate. We're also seeing improvement in his leash manners. Tate enjoys going for walks and has been learning to focus on his handler. He should make a great walking (or running) partner. With treat-based reward training he should continue to make strides! Before arriving at the shelter, Tate doesn't appear to have had any experience with toys - but now that he's getting the hang of it he is starting to entertain himself. He likes to chew on Kongs and is learning to play fetch. He'll burn off some calories as he learns to play new games with his family! But for a younger dog he is fairly mellow. He follows his family's energy level. He'll spend plenty of time curled up on the couch with you. Tate has a comical nature that should keep a smile on everyone's face. He would love to be the only dog in the home, with a family that can establish a routine for him that contains training, exercise, and affection. This dog has all the makings of a great long-term companion for a lucky family! And remember that when you adopt from APA you're not only giving Tate a home, you're also allowing a second dog to join us.",

He recently came to Happy Hearts and we are learning more about him each day. So far, he seems to be very loving, affectionate and playful with the volunteers. He definitely will need to be in an active home, but also a home that will show that there are boundaries and rules that he must follow. As with many husky's, they are stubborn, but crave to learn new tricks, play tug of war and daily mental stimulation as well as exercise. They are a very loyal breed with an owner who is willing to put in the training to give these pups what they crave. Are you looking for a hiking, camping or just a cute looking active partner, then maybe Jimi is your guy! As we learn more about this petite size pup, we will update his profile!",

Meaning, I like to explore, I have lots of energy, I like to give every human and fellow canine a friendly hello, I can jump tall fences, I love walks, I like stealing shoes and pillows, I jump up on kitchen counters if you let me and hey, did I mention I\u2019m a whirlwind? Yeah, that\u2019s me, alright. But I also like to snuggle, curl up in a comfy spot, and my foster mum says I\u2019m a real quick learner, too. Is there anything I don\u2019t like? Well, being left alone for starters \u2013 that\u2019s just scary and oh-so-boring! I like being near you! Not too keen on crates, I must say. And yeah, these wheely things, my foster humans call them bicycles \u2013 I like chasing them. Oh wait, we\u2019re back to what I like! Well, if you like me, then let\u2019s make a deal, shall we? I\u2019ll be part of your family, and you let me do (almost) all the things I like. I\u2019d like that!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Rodger is about 1 year old and weighs 60 lbs.]\n\n(2101)",

She is kind and trusting, gentle and sweet, as she sees the world for the first time. She is still learning to use her legs properly - think drunk person or baby giraffe - ha! - but making progress every day. Her fur was so stained, we had to have it shaved off. \"Starting over\" is the theme for this special girl. She is one of a kind and will absolutely steal your heart. She loves people, kids and other dogs. She is @50 lbs and might be a Saint Bernard mix.",

Griffith\u2019s favorite pastime is cuddling, and he will push his floppy head into your chest and under your arms for hugs. Griffith is around 3-4 years old and 45 lbs. Sadly, he does have heartworm disease, but he is currently being treated and doing just fine. \n\nIf you are interested in Griffith, please complete our adoption application by accessing the following link: https://fs29.formsite.com/RDR1/AdoptionApp/index.html\n\nIf you have any questions about Griffith, please email carol@realdogrescue.org.

He is very confident.\nHe is not good with livestock as he gets excited around them and barks at them. \nHe is active and needs some exercise every day. A fenced yard would be best for him with a dog friend. He is good on a leash but needs practice as he was not trained before we received him at Huckleberry.

            "description": "We rescued Angel baby from the shelter 2 months ago. This is why we do what we do! For these precious faces! I took a chance on her when the shelter reached out to us to help her. Angel was one of the lucky ones out of the bunch we took in at the end of the year. This poor girl was treated like trash! She was neglected, abused, skinny, malnourished, and used for breeding. She had puppies recently which unfortunately all ended up dying. If you look at the pictures you can see what condition she was in and how she came to us. Just breaks your heart! Her skin was a mess and her eyes were so shut down. She had a huge gash on her head. Her boobs were still big full of milk. She had cuts, bites, scars, and sores all over her. I can\u2019t imagine the previous life she had. Humans did this to her!\n\nI have been fostering Angel for 2 months now and I\u2019m finally getting to know her personality. Her eyes have life now! She is absolutely precious and so sweet! Angel doesn\u2019t let her past get in her way! She\u2019s full of confidence and so loving with people! Her skin has healed up and she has gained weight! She is actually a healthy dog now! Angel has gotten along with every dog I\u2019ve had her around. She has acclimated with my pack so good. She listens well and perfectly crate trained. Every day we are working with her and getting her ready for a bright future. \n\nAngel is a 4 year old pit bull mix with cropped ears. She\u2019s around 60ish lbs now that she\u2019s gained weight. Angel would benefit in a active home with other dogs. No cats. She loves car rides and going on adventures. Angel is ready to start meeting potential adopters. If you are interested in sweet Angel please send us a detailed email and request a application! Must be home owners with a fully fenced in yard and have bully breed experience. She is fostered in Sacramento and we only adopt locally in Northern California.",

We took care of his medical and has his cherry eye fixed. He\u2019s learning how to be a inside dog and listen better. He\u2019s a good boy that is still learning manners. He sure knows how to impress with his cuteness! \n\nSolo is under 2 years old, compact 60 lbs, crate trained and has been good with the potty training. He is dog friendly just gets too excited and pushy so he needs slow intros with new dogs. We recommend bigger compatible dogs. He\u2019s a active boy and loves playing with his toys. He can get mouthy when he\u2019s playing so you have to make sure he doesn\u2019t get overly stimulated. Solo is a sweet boy with a lot of personality! \n\nWe only adopt to home owners with a fully fenced in yard and must have bully breed experience. Solo does need a home who will continue working with him and training. No cats and no small children as he is a bulldozer and can knock down a little one. He is fostered in Sacramento and we adopt locally in Northern California.  If you are interested in meeting Solo please send us a detailed email and request a application.",

One of his favorite things is when his humans rub his belly and his tail just goes thump thump thump as he enjoys the attention. \n\nOdin is a big guy at 110 pounds, and he\u2019s healthy as a horse. He still has some energy for a 7 year old large breed dog and does best when he can get out for some exercise and mental stimulation everyday. \n\nOdin has lived with other dogs, but does seem to want to be the top dog. He also tends to guard his food so if he goes to a home with another dog that will need to be managed. He would do best in a mature household without cats. \n\nWe think Odin would be in heaven if he got adopted by an active person who is looking for a best buddy to have adventures with, and then chill out at home with afterwards. And who wouldn\u2019t want such an amazing best friend?\n\nWe are partnering with Big Bones Canine Rescue to find a loving forever home for Odin. If you are interested please email us at woof@olddogsnewdigs.com and we will get you pointed in the right direction. And please help us get the word out about Odin and share share share!!!!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

She enjoys being in your lap, toys, and playing with her brother. She is mostly house trained and good in the car. She is not good with other dogs, especially those that are bigger than her. She strongly prefers sleeping in the big bed with her family and brother. If you are interested in these two, please complete an application at ctdr.org.",

She is timid at first, but warms up with a little time and reassurance. Patches will need to go to a home without any toddlers or small children. She will make a great inside lap and couch buddy.\n...................................If you would like further information or would like to request an adoption application, please e-mail us directly at hss@cablelynx.com.

            "description": "Hello, my name is Huck! I was surrendered because I needed some medical care and my family needed help caring for me. I didn't always get along with the other male dog in my home but I would frequently go next door to play with the girl dog over there. I should not be around cats or other small animals. I have been friendly to all of the people I have met in the shelter. All of the volunteers enjoy taking me out on walks because I walk nicely on my leash. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $95.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included.",

I am not immediately aggressive, i just choose not to socialize. i would make an absolutely amazing companion animal for a single person or younger couple who wants an apartment dog. i am mostly quiet, and housebroken and crate trained! \n\n",

We have no history on him. His age is a guess.\n\nHe is a very sweet senior boy that doesn't get along with other dogs or cats. He is housetrained, does well on walks, and loves car rides.\n\nGoliath takes thyroid medication twice a day and will need to have his thyroid checked every 6 months.\n\nBecause of the lack of history on him, he will only be placed with older children.\n\nIf you are interested in Goliath or any of our fosters, please go to our website at www.mastiffrescueoregon.org, click on adoption info, and submit an application online. Meet and greets will not be done without an application on file.\n\nOur fosters are in private residences. Please do not call prior to 8;00am or after 8:00pm",

            "description": "VERNA LOUISE\n\nVerna Louise is 3 1/2 years old and may be a Golden Doodle (but her face looks like an Irish Wolfhound). This friendly girl is about 55-60 lbs, She is about the size of a short standard poodle.  She IS a barker but a collar that beeps then vibrates can be used and she won\u2019t bark as much...except at her toy balls! She WANTS her balls!!!\n\nThis beautiful girl is REALLY a happy puppy, but needs to be an only dog. Verna is a a wonderful, affectionate, happy, energetic dog that needs a loving, active family. She needs to be in a house without other dogs or cats. She loves to play fetch and usually has a ball in her mouth. She rides great in a car.\n\nShe has gone through basic and intermediate training at the Complete Canine with Jeremy Brown and passed with flying colors. She knows hand signals and will respond immediately to them. She's also had snake training.\n\nVerna is a Doodle and will need periodic grooming. \n\nYou must have a secure, fenced yard, and the time to train a puppy. These bigger breeds have endless energy when they are young. They must be exercised to be healthy & mentally stable nice dogs. This dog must be walked or taken to a dog park every day. They are working dogs, and if they don't have a job, they will find one, like dismantling your couch.\nNot trying to scare you away, but if your energy is limited PLEASE adopt an older more placid dog. If you are gone more than four hours a day this dog is not for you. \n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rottie & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Verna Louise or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, groomed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

            "description": "This handsome boy is Will. He was a stray in TN that was being fed by volunteers. He was eventually rescued and placed in a foster homer. Initially, he was malnourished with little energy, but with good food training and TLC, he is definitely flourishing and coming into his own.\n\nWill is very sweet and just adores love and attention. His foster is home most of the time and has been working with him daily and he has adapted well to his new life as an indoor pet.\nWill would do best with a home where his people can spend a lot of time with him. Another dog would be recommended as he enjoys their companionship and loves to play. \n\nWill does show some resource food guarding with other dogs, so would need to fed separately. After being in the situation he was in, this is to be expected. Will is otherwise friendly with other dogs, shares toys and loves to run and play in the yard. Will would do better with dogs of his same personality/activity level, we would like him to be adopted to a home with another dog.\n\nWill did test positive for heartworm and has begun pre-treatment. PAWS will guide you through his treatment (and of course, foot the bill). This will require you to live somewhat near to one of our partner vets that administer the treatment.\n\nWill is crate trained and will go into his crate and sleeps in his crate at night, but does have to be bribed and nudged to go in, as he prefers to stay by his people. No accidents in the crate. He is progressing well with housetraining, but still needs to be taken out for his potty breaks and encouraged. \nHe also does well on a leash with minimal pulling.\n\nCheck out will playing with his foster sibling: \nhttps://youtu.be/Or-SAqkIV4E\n \nApply today for this striking boy!\n\nName: Will\nBreed: Terrier Mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 2-3 yrs old (estimate)\nWeight: 57 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes, 1/13/21\nVaccinations: UTD\nHeartworm: Positive, started treatment 1/7/21\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Has been around a 7 and 9yr old but not lived with them.\nGood with Dogs: Yes, a canine sibling is recommended since Will loves to play. \nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is PEANUT, I'm a sweet Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler mix looking for a FurEver home. Here's what my foster mom has to say about me! Apply to meet me at tailsandtrails.org!\n\nPeanut aka Buddy has made tremendous progress in his first week with his foster family. After a rough start as one of the \"\"Tennessee Treasures\"\", he is learning to be a puppy. With no prior exposure to treats, toys and snuggles, he has quickly learned to love all three. Buddy is crate trained and will often take a break in his crate where he stashes all his toys! He is working hard on housebreaking and is most reliable if taken outside on a frequent schedule. He has mastered \"\"Sit\"\" and is working on \"\"Down\"\", \"\"Fetch\"\" and walking on a leash. He is an old soul in a puppy's body and often chooses to sit quietly and observe especially in new situations. He gets along well with his rat terrier and Aussie sisters and Aussie brother. He is very curious, but gentle with the farm cats. While comfortable in the house, he is still timid about being outside with new smells and sounds. It helps to have a fellow dog out with him. His owner will need to be consistent with his outside experiences - using the same door, taking him to a regular area to relieve himself. Buddy needs time to feel comfortable in a new environment. Inside, he is a curious puppy, but he responds well when asked to leave something alone. Buddy loves a good spa treatment including bath and nail trim. He gets along well with his human siblings and their teenage friends. He has shown no aggression with food, toys or strangers and is normally very quiet. While cautious and quiet in nature, Buddy still loves to play and be a puppy.",

I'm 10 years old and just 51 pounds, so not super big, which is not very bear like. I'm a real good boy around older kids, but the little ones are just too much for me. I do okay around female dogs who aren't going to be in my face and will give me my space. Please no male dogs though, I'm not very fond of them. Foster mom says although she introduced me to a cat, she can't say that I could live with one. I'm very hyper focused on them, and I would hate to be put in a situation where I would ever hurt anything. I would do perfectly fine in a home where I get all the attention and love from my humans, you know, their one and only. I'm mostly housetrained, but I will need a bit of help with knowing what's expected of me, and being taught that marking things in my new home isn't okay. Luckily, you can put a belly band on me until I know that's not acceptable. I just need my new people to be patient and show me the ropes of my new home!\n\nI'm a gentle, easy going guy who likes going for walks or just hanging out in the back yard with my family. If you have a fenced yard I'd love to play with you or your human friends while you cook out on warm summer nights. I'm pretty social eith all the humans I meet, so I'll be sure to keep your friends company! I can't wait for my new humans to take me home so we can start being a forever family!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

            "description": "Molly is an affectionate, spunky, responsive Border Collie who is about two and a half years old.  She is smart as a whip and will benefit from some positive reinforcement training.  Molly walks fairly well on a leash already.\n\nWe are still assessing Molly's compatibility with other dogs.  As can be seen in the attached video she is perfectly friendly with the pitbull she is currently living with.  However, other introductions have been sketchy.  We will update this profile when we learn more. Currently, we are looking for a foster home without other dogs.  Molly loves people!\n\nHer ideal home would provide her with the exercise, enrichment, and mental engagement she craves. She's a touch overweight so needs some physical conditioning, and a foster guardian who is home the majority of the time.  She is dedicated to the fetch game!  If you have a fenced yard big enough to throw a ball, she'd be happy to play fetch 4 or 5 times a day as an adjunct to her other exercise and enrichment.  \n\nThis girl needs an active home. Our best guess is that she could become neurotic, destructive and/or misbehaved if left alone or confined for long periods, under-exercised, or not provided with enough enrichment.  A home with Border Collie experience would be a plus, as would a family interested in outdoor adventure or a dog sport such as agility, obedience training, nose work, rally, treibball, (or really any dog sport).\n\nTrue to her breed, she can be a little nibbly and nippy - she occasionally takes a treat hard - a habit that is easy to reverse but we wouldn't feel comfortable placing her in a home with young children.\n\nIf you think you can help with Molly, please fill out our application found here:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nPlease note, our application to foster and to adopt are the SAME - just adapt your answers accordingly.\n\nIf you have questions, email us at connellpetrescue@gmail.com\n\n",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting, please apply directly with bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt.\n\nAvailable for adoption in WA and OR. Fostered in Tacoma and available for meet and greets.\n \nPonderosa \"Rosie\" is a wonderful, extremely friendly and sociable, smart, and athletic dog. Her current caregivers have worked extensively on training her - she is house trained and knows basic obedience. They've been working on good leash behavior (although she still pulls) and she has been well-socialized to other dogs. She gets along reasonably well with the resident cat (although is reactive to cats outside on walks, so any future owners should be very cautious and deliberate in introducing them).\n\nRosie is estimated at about 9 months old currently. She is currently about 40 pounds.\n\nHer ideal home would be a very active one, and ideally one that has other playful dogs. She currently goes to doggy daycare several days per week.\n\nOur adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping and transport expenses. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset travel and medical expenses.\n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt",

At first, Bonnie can be shy when it comes to other dogs but after a few minutes, she will eventually play with them. I would like to say that Bonnie would be good with cats too if introduced properly, but I have not personally seen an interaction.\u00a0\n\nThankfully, she is potty trained and kennel trained, plus actually loves to be inside it during bad weather, it gives her comfort within her own space.\u00a0\n\nBonnie loves a good adventure and can lead/guide you on walks or walk beside you, depending on the manner that you allow her to have, she will comply.\u00a0\n\nBonnie\u2019s ideal family is someone who likes to go on long walks, run (exercise) with her, a huge backyard and who are very loving and understanding to her needs. She ask for a lot of love and attention. She would be perfect with growing kids/teenagers to keep her company.\u00a0\n\nI would not recommend a home without a backyard, no to tiny spaces and no to elderly people. Her perfect family would be perfect with someone that has a huge yard for her to run in and exhaust her energy.\u00a0\n\nLet us know if you have more questions and want to meet Bonnie!",

Based on his current size he will likely be around 60-70 lbs full grown but your guess is as good as ours. Jegu is one of the more independent puppies in his litter. He loves to play and snuggles when he's done. He is a big fan of tug toys and jumping on his siblings too. If your family is ready to have a fun loving puppy in your lives and all the puppy responsibilities that come with it, apply today to meet him!\n\nBreed is just a guess, born 12/1/20\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $275___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

He is quick to please and is usually waiting patiently next to his foster mom, ready to be picked up or given a treat.\u00a0We aren't sure on breed and he likely has many different breeds in him, which makes him the perfect rescue mutt. Based on his current size he will likely be around 60-70 lbs full grown but your guess is as good as ours. Photos don't do Raph justice, he is so much cuter in person and the smallest of the boys in his litter. If your family is ready to have a fun loving puppy in your lives and all the puppy responsibilities that come with it, apply today to meet him!\n\nBreed is just a guess, born 12/1/20\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $275___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

I am an adorable, 7 year old, 70lb., Lab mix! I love being with my humans and want to spend all the time in the world with you! I would do well in an apartment setting or a home with a privacy fenced in yard! I am not about those crazy things called car rides so no trucker life for me! I am completely house trained but am working hard on crate training! I think it is going really well! I would love a home with children but it is not a requirement! Have you ever met a feline? I have and let me tell you, those are weird so none of those in my home please! I am letting my faith be bigger than any of my fears! Fill out my application today! \n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $75 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.

DOB tbd), male, 50 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Yes he is absolutely adorable BUT Boss will only be matched with a home that has experience to provide him a structured balanced day and can exercise him. Think Border Collie............ His ideal home would be active, have no other dogs (he gets along with other dogs but does exhibit a prey drive), and no small children. Stay tuned for more information as Boss is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Boss please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He's friendly with everyone he meets and is quite affectionate (his signature move is to nudge or poke you with his nose until you pet him). Leon is incredibly smart, too. He learns quickly and will sit, lay down, roll over, and play dead on command. Of course, he's also smart enough to \"train\" his humans to do what HE wants, and would be most successful with an experienced owner who will continue his obedience training. Leon enjoys playing with friendly dogs--he is most compatible with rough-and-tumble females and sometimes clashes with other strong-willed male dogs. Leon walks well on leash, is good with kids, and enjoys spending time indoors with his favorite people.\n\nDue to Leons size and rough and rowdy play style, he is not recommended to live with small dogs, and no cats as he loves to chase them.\n\nBreed experience is recommended for this wonderful boy.",

            "description": "IN NEED OF LOCAL FOSTER OR ADOPTER/ AVAILABLE FOR FOSTER TO ADOPT FOR LOCAL ADOPTERS\n\nMeet Jasper! More pictures and video to come!\n\nJasper is 13 months old (approx. DOB tbd), male, 56 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Jasper was found homeless by a good samaritan in North Carolina. Jasper had been seen several times wandering in the area but it took him earning trust with visits from a rescuer to recover him to safety! He was very scared of the world. Since being in foster care he has really started to learn about life! Jasper is good with other dogs (needs another dog in the home), may be good with cats (non reactive in Vets office but will chase birds), has medium energy, is scared of new situations, and is a quieter boy. Jasper's ideal home would be experienced with fearful dogs, have older kids, and a well balanced dog/dogs to play with and help him with his confidence to learn not to be scared of people. Stay tuned for more information as Jasper is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Jasper please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are\n\nthere)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

The requested adoption donation for this dog is $275___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption.

            "description": "Name: Howie\nBreed: Doberman Mix\nAge: 1 Year\nSex: Male\nWeight: 75 lbs. \nBefore OMD: Found as a stray and did a short stint at the city shelter until his hold was up and he became a part of our crew. \nEnergy Level: High, but nothing that can't be worked out with a few walks, some backyard play time, and an occasional stuffed toy. \nSnuggle Level: Equally high but only after a serious play session and a sprint (or ten) around the yard. \nSmarty Pants Level: You guessed it....high again. His foster dad says he's unbelievably intelligent and he has never seen a dog learn so fast! \nWords to describe him: Gentle. Athletic. Loyal. Affectionate. Silly. Handsome. Smart.\nWhat we love most: He has a heart of gold. He is always happy. He will do anything just to sit at your feet or by your side and put his head in your lap. He forgets how leggy he is, gets excited and occasionally trips over himself (#doofusalert)\nWhat he loves most: All types of food, broccoli and carrots included. Any kind of treat. Big bacon fan. His stuffed donut. His dinosaur toy. Walks. Playing in the yard. Cuddling up with his foster dad. Sharing the bed with his foster bro. Watching the world from the window. \nLife goal: Toss up...find a buffet and eat to his heart\u2019s content or make a living as a professional cuddler.\nWhat he knows: Sit. Down. Paw. Plus he barks to let you know when he needs to go out or when he wants to come back in.\nWhat he\u2019s working on: Being patient. Reigning in his exuberance when he\u2019s excited, especially over food.\nClaim to fame: He learned his commands in less than 24 hours!\nKids: Yes, but dog-savvy, sturdy kiddos only! He is gentle with little ones but he is still a puppy in a big ol\u2019 body!\nDogs: Definitely! Though he\u2019s more content being part of a smaller pack in a home (he adores his Lab mix foster brother) vs. a large, high-energy pack in a daycare or dog park setting. He also prefers to not share his food with other dogs (we don\u2019t blame him!) \nCats: No problem. He\u2019s made friends with the cat in his foster home and happily shares his space.\nHousebroken: Yep! \nCrate Trained: Sure is!\nWish List: A multi-person home (the more attention the better) with a big backyard and another animal friend or two. Active humans who are equally dedicated to outside adventures and Netflix and chill (with Howie on the couch or in bed).\nHowie is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative and microchipped. He\u2019s available for adoption to residents of CT and surrounding states. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application from Omdrescue.org.",

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Tucker! Here is his video collage in NC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/O6gmsGJLkZc\n\nTucker is 2 years old (approx. DOB 12-15-18), male, 57 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Tucker was found as a homeless stray in North Carolina. Vet conveyed Tucker has some sort of old injury and has an odd stance in his hind end but it does not bother him.\n\nIN HIS CURRENT DAYCARE/BOARDING ENVIRONMENT (we make no guarantees starting over in a new dynamic):\n\nGood with Dogs? Yes\n\nGood with Cats? Unknown\n\nHas a prey drive? Haven't witnessed any prey drive\n\nGood with smaller kids (mouthy, nippy, jumpy, chase, scared)? Older kids, playful but wobbly\n\nEnergy Level (low, low-medium, medium, medium-high, or high)? Medium\n\nScared of people or socially outgoing? Outgoing but scared in new situations\n\nNeeds another dog in the home (if scared of people), ok as only, or either way? Either way\n\nCrate trained? Yes\n\nDoes he like the crate? Good in crate\n\nPotty trained? Clean in crate\n\nSeparation Anxiety from people when left alone? No\n\nVocal? No quieter boy\n\nBehavior on leash when walking near lots of people/dogs? Ok on leash; pulls a little\n\nConcerning behavior: back end wobbly, possibly old injury, does not need medical attention, doesn't hinder him, super cute\n\nBest in the busy City or rural calm or doesn't matter? Rural probably best\n\nHe was incredibly scared at the shelter. Stay tuned for more information as Tucker s a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Tucker please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Lady has a severe fungal infection, osteomyelitis legions in both front legs that are causing her to limp, and then on top of all that she has the papilloma virus. The papilloma virus caused her to have warts on her body and in her mouth. She is going to be on antibiotics and injections 3 times a week, that will hopefully enable her immune system to fight off the papilloma virus and the warts will go away. The papilloma virus is contagious to other dogs but not to humans. \n\nWe have to say that even with everything going on she is one of the sweetest and happy boxer girls you could ever meet.  She is housebroken and very calm. She is going to be starting special meds to help that we had to get compounded.  \n\nIf you are interested in Lady when she is available for adoption, please reach out to Barbara at BarbaraABoxer@gmail.com. \n\nLady\nFemale\nAge: 3/4\nDogs: Males Only \nCats: Unknown\nKids: 10+",

He was born with one eye, which is a trait of the Double Dapple breeding. He is up to date with all of his vaccines and will be neutered this coming week.\nHe is a very friendly to people and a very playful chap with the other dogs. He is house broken, rides well in the car and knows his way around a doggie door. His tail is always wagging and he loves to snuggle next to you under a blanket on the sofa or in the big bed. His one beautiful blue eye is working great but he likes you to approach slowly on the left side.\nIf you are interested in giving Popeye his forever home, please complete an application at ctdr.org.",

Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.

The requested adoption donation for this dog is $300___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.

She would make a great companion for hikes and other outdoor activities but also loves to take time to pause and give you big hugs. We think she would also love to be a couch snuggle buddy. She has so much personality and loves to \u201ctalk\u201d to other humans and pups. If interested in this all-around great pup, ask us today how to meet her! \nPlease stop by the City of Jackson Animal Shelter at 140 Outer Circle, Jackson, MS during their adoption hr (10 - 4 M - F and 8:30-10:30 Sat) to meet Liberty and take a leash with you so that you can take her outside for a walk and get to know her a little better.  For more information, please contact Jillian (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone (601.209.8781) or email (jcrosson@cochlear.com). Liberty is eligible for a free spay thru Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter.  For more pictures and information, please take a look at our Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter page on Facebook.",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

She is very jealous and doesn\u2019t like to share toys or food with other dogs.\n\nCats: Not much exposure\n\nKids: Adult home only, no young kids. She is your typical Chihuahua and bonds with her one person.\n\nHousebroken: Not yet, about 80%, Millie HATES the cold.\n\nLeash Trained: Not yet - she will need a home with a fenced yard - no apartments or condos and she is trained on a doggy door too!\n\nCrate Trained: Yes\n\nSheds: Not Much\n\nBarks: yes, normal barking, not excessive. \n\nCar Rides: She seems to be OK in the car.\n\n\nMillie is very cuddly. A TOTAL SNUGGLE BUG! Her favorite spot is on a lap or snuggled up right next to you. She must be able to sleep with you at night in bed.  She is very playful with people and dogs --- although, she doesn\u2019t like to share her toys or food with other dogs, so Millie will do best as the only dog in the home.\n\nMillie was rescued from the highway weaving through busy traffic in Mexico. She was full of fleas and very skinny. Millie has turned into a gem. She will be the perfect only pet in the home and will keep your lap warm.\n\n\nMillie was rescued in Guadalajara, Mexico and fostered in Mexico through our organization \u201cThe MexiMutt Project\u201d (You can read more about our organization on Facebook and Instagram). Please keep in mind that our dogs are rescued off the streets or were living outside 24/7 --- so they are NOT always 100% housebroken and will need time to adjust and transition.\n\n\nAdoption fee is $550 - that covers all of the vaccines (DHLPP, Rabies and Bordetella), current on flea/tick treatment, fecal testing, deworming, sterilization (spay/neuter), Heartworm-Lyme-Ehrlichia-Anaplasma Blood Test, dental cleaning (if needed), Distemper and Parvo blood test to make sure the dog is disease-free, Health Certificate, Microchip with registration, grooming before transport and the flight transport from Guadalajara, Mexico to Portland, Oregon. We will also send the dog home with a brand new collar, ID tag, leash and a small bag of the kibble.\n\n\nFill out an online adoption application here: www.BAPBR.org\n\n\n*Please know that we are a 100% volunteer ran organization, with no paid employees and we work full time jobs and have our own families to care for as well. Due to the large number of applications we receive - we are not able to reply to everyone individually. If we think you are the right match for our dog, we will reach out to you and set up a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for understanding.",

            "description": "Meet Honey Toast!\n\nHello, we would like you to meet Honey Toast. She is a 9 yr old, 30 lb mix, although the vet said she could afford to lose 3 to 5 pounds. We do not know any of her background other than she came up from the south. Her behavior & sweetness would suggest that she was loved at one time and something unfortunate happened. You can't tell from her pictures, but she is blind. Please don't feel sad or sorry for her because she does not let that stop her. Toast just relies heavily on her other senses and does just fine. She is a happy, sweet, loving girl, who moves a bit slower due to some arthritis. Toast gets around by smelling her surroundings or follows the sound of your voice or other sounds like patting your leg. For the first few days she is going to rely on you to help her learn her new surroundings. She loves all the attention you are willing to give her. Please remember to talk to Toast as you approach her or before you touch her - it's just not fun if you pop out of nowhere and touch her without warning. Remember, she needs to hear you since she cannot see you. She will be so very happy to receive your attention. She really likes ear scratches and belly rubs. She would love to sit up on the furniture with her family, she is respectful when asking. If she is not welcome on the sofa she is happy to just curl up at your feet on a pillow or dog bed. She will kennel up if you need her to and probably a good idea if you are going to be gone for a long time to keep her safe, although she would probably just sleep all day but kenneling would give you a peace of mind that she is safe. Toast is house trained, if on a regular potty schedule. Her cues are a little hard to pick up so a regular schedule is just easier. Toast is being fostered with 5 other dogs, two her size and 3 smaller. She has yet to engage them in activity and she just leaves them alone. However, she is very willing to share a bed with them. Toast is a good eater, very food motivated, and she will try to follow her nose to other food bowls if she finishes first. She has not been around children but her calm easy going demeanor would suggest she would be fine around older more respectful kids that understand her specialness. We don't believe cats would be a problem either as she would not see them to chase them, and she's a slow mover. Her ideal forever home would be a calm clutter free environment. She can manage the two steps off the back porch with a little guidance, but since she can not see a flight of stairs it would be best to keep her clear from them so she won't fall down them. If you have a comfortable dog bed regardless of size in any room that you are in, she will find it and curl up on it just to be near you. If you have room in your heart, and time for a sweet easy going girl who has lots of love to give her new family. Please consider Toast. She is such a loving girl!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

It doesn\u2019t take much to fall in love with this girl and recognize that her life hasn\u2019t been easy, and that she\u2019s amazingly inspiring to be so\njoyful! Her past was full of massive neglect, extreme over breeding and most of her life caged awaiting her next heat cycle. This beautiful being deserves a cherished home and a heart felt apology on behalf of mankind. Her resilience, loving, calm temperament, loyalty and appreciation for the simplest things,  sunshine, cuddles, kisses, car rides even just back and forth to the vet and her authentic joy of life is humbling. She is discerning at first, why wouldn\u2019t she be, and then when she sees that a person\u2019s intention is kind, her grateful eyes and trusting submissive invitation to rub her face and belly makes you feel so good to be recognized as earning her discerning rating as kind and trustworthy. \n\nShe is 4 years old HW + and awaiting the next portion of her treatment. The treatments costs will be covered by the rescue. Her original X-rays show both her heart and lungs had been affected, though and her body is responding very well to the vetting and other than an occasional cough, she is thriving. \n\nDuring treatments, she will need to stay low active and luckily she truly prefers a very calm lifestyle anyway and will be very easily cooperative thru the recovery time. She absolutely loves couch cuddling with her people, loves walks, sleeping outside in the sunshine, any treats, being with the family, car rides and often appreciates the sanctuary of her crate preferably in the family room. She is great with other calm dogs and moderately tolerates the rambunctious ones. Great with all loving people, good with respectful children, wary of strangers, protective of intruders though fabulous in a crate when workers come when shown you have it covered.   She is very smart, knows sit, and stay, has a very gentle mouth, sits and waits her turn for treats while respectfully allowing other dogs to get theirs. She has no food aggression and once trust is earned, easily allows even her highest value items to easily be removed.  She is extremely responsive, wants to please , a fast learner and is a true love. A blessing to be around one so forgiving and resilient.  \n\nShe will need someone compassionate and generous who understands and loves the breed with the ability to give her the love she so badly deserves and never got until rescued. \n\nThere\u2019s a beautiful video about her at the below link. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/706989103/posts/10159099478929104/?d=n",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

            "description": "How's about a handsome black cur mix or maybe a little bit of hound/mastiff in there - honestly, we have zero clue what he's made up of but goodness it's a great cocktail!!\n\nHe had what we think was a tough life before he was rescued by our friends at All 4's - he was tied up with a chain in someone's back yard. Eventually they were able to convince the owner to let him go so his vetting has been done and he's ready to start his life.\n\nHis foster mom reports he absolutely LOVES LOVES LOVES stuffed animals or \"\"babies\"\" as she calls them. He leaves the toys all over the house, she picks them up, puts them in the \"\"toy box\"\" and he then takes them out again and distributes them throughout the house.\n\nHe's \"\"super loving and sweet\"\" with her and her nieces and nephews that come to visit - he is tentative around strangers but is getting better all the time!\n\nHe is walking really well on a leash and his recall is getting really good!\n\nNeed an adopter with dog experience. Prefers smaller men.\n\nHope you'll consider this guy.\n\n\nName: Chaco\nBreed: Black Mouth Cur/Terrier\nSex: Male\nAge: 2 years approx.\nWeight: 75\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Yes Older\nGood with Dogs: Tentative\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "MARLEY, 9 years, was brought to Babylon Animal Shelter as a stray last Oct. The only indication this weathered senior once had a home was a filthy yellow collar around his neck. Shortly after, it was learned MARLEY was a known dog who had spent most of his life on the end of a chain. The man who placed that yellow collar around his neck never came for him, which was the most fortunate act in MARLEY\u2019S entire life. \n\nWhen we met MARLEY during our shelter outreach initiative we promised we would be back for him. Today, we made good on this and picked him up as a transfer to our #OneLuckyPup program. \n\nSomewhere in the euphoria of warm hugs from the incredible shelter volunteers, smiling shelter staff, elation from our team on the ground and the camaraderie of adding a new foster to our organization, a worn but robust dog wearing the gentle anxiety that comes from something unknown but decidedly good happening, became ours.\n\nMARLEY\u2019S unkind past included another dog, but he is not well socialized and is reactive to more dogs than not - this may be stress or he may be dog selective. He would like a home where he can age gracefully as your only pet and reverse the years of living outside, restricted to the boundaries of his chain. MARLEY has skin and dental issues we will  be addressing before he is adopted. Mostly though, MARLEY is everything you see in the video!\n\nTo adopt MARLEY within a four hour drive of Long Island visit the below link for an online application: www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt\nQuestions? elli@mrbonesandco.org\n\n#AdoptMarleyMBC \n",

            "description": "Euro is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nEuro is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~3 years \nWeight: ~42lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle but overall doing well with his crate training\nDog sociability: Selective with dog pals. May be a match for some, but not all. Doesn't particularly enjoy meeting dogs on walks and may do best with slower intros. \nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Euro is looking for a home in a quieter neighborhood. He is heartworm positive and will need to maintain exercise restriction for the next ~9 months, so lots of enrichment should be in his future! He is also a tripod, but that doesn't slow him down one bit!\n\nEuro is the sweetest guy with three legs and one big heart of gold! He has the silkiest black fur that will make you want to pet him endlessly. Euro loves to be with his people and is always content to sit next to you and take in some snuggles. He hasn't really gotten the hang of toys too much yet, but he might with some more time! He very much enjoys walks where he can sniff all the things on the sidewalk and explore his neighborhood. He has been a little iffy with other dogs, and may like some but probably wouldn't want to be in a dog park environment - slower intros are more his speed. Euro is looking for an adopter that can provide lots of good mental enrichment (puzzle toys, treat balls, etc) while he needs to be kept calm these next few months as he undergoes his heartworm treatment. Euro came to us as tripod and we do not know why he's missing a limb, but this guy gets around just fine and is adaptable to many living environments. \n\nEuro is heartworm positive and will be undergoing treatment at our Ellis Veterinary Clinic. OTAT will cover the cost of his treatment until he is heartworm negative. For information on the heartworm treatment process, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nEuro's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date (3/4/21) and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

The owner is not married and there are two other dogs in the home. Wraith gets along better with females and less dominant dogs. He is currently in his second fear period and is very afraid of new stimuli, strangers, and new places. He warms up well given about 30 minutes. \n\nWraith needs an experienced owner due to his lack of socialization and training. He knows a few commands like sit and down. He walks very well on a leash. He rides very well in a car and just settles down in the back. \n\nWraith lived with children in his prior home on a part time basis, however it is recommended that he go to a home with no children or only older more experienced teenagers. \n\nWraith has absolutely NO ball drive.

Smiley was raised in a hoarding situation in an outside pen with many other dogs, and was not socialized as a puppy, so she is nervous around new people. If you give her time and patience, she will come for pets and ear rubs. She is a good girl, who is quiet and very gentle, and she loves car rides. Both dogs enjoy toys and wrestling and napping together. \n\nBoth of the girls are young adults, so an ideal home will be willing to take them for walks and have a securely fenced yard.\n\nThis pair is NOT recommended for a family with young children. \n\nIf you are reading this, we are still accepting applications on this pet. \n\nOur Adoption Process:\n\n\n\tMeet the Adoption Criteria. Before you do anything else, make sure you meet our adoption criteria. You must be at least 21 years old. You must live within a 60-mile radius of Richardson, Texas. You must share veterinary records for all pets currently in your home and all pets owned in the last five years. All pets in the home must be spayed or neutered. If you rent your home, you must provide verification that pets are allowed on the property. You must be willing to be interviewed by an adoption counselor and you must undergo an in person or virtual home visit from an RHS representative.\n\tComplete Application. https://www.richardsonhumanesociety.org/adopt/\n\tPhone Interview. Compatible applicants will be forwarded to a counselor who will contact the applicant for a phone interview.\n\tHome Visit. If all the steps above are completed satisfactorily, we will set up a visit where you can meet the pet you are interested in. We will try to include the foster parent so you can learn more about how the pet is in a home environment.\n\tComplete Adoption. If all feel it is a good match, we will schedule the adoption at your home or an off-site location. The applicant will need to complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies (under 1 year) and $125 for cats. Discounts are available for senior-aged pets.",

            "description": "Gidget and Smiley are a bonded pair of girls who will only be adopted TOGETHER. Gidget is a lively fun, little dog and these two love to play together. Smiley was raised in a hoarding situation in an outside pen with many other dogs, and was not socialized as a puppy, so she is nervous around new people. If you give her time and patience, she will come for pets and ear rubs. She is a good girl, who is quiet and very gentle, and she loves car rides. Both dogs enjoy toys and wrestling and napping together. \n\nBoth of the girls are young adults, so an ideal home will be willing to take them for walks and have a securely fenced yard.\n\nThis pair is NOT recommended for a family with young children. \n\nIf you are reading this, we are still accepting applications on this pet. \n\nOur Adoption Process:\n\n\n\tMeet the Adoption Criteria. Before you do anything else, make sure you meet our adoption criteria. You must be at least 21 years old. You must live within a 60-mile radius of Richardson, Texas. You must share veterinary records for all pets currently in your home and all pets owned in the last five years. All pets in the home must be spayed or neutered. If you rent your home, you must provide verification that pets are allowed on the property. You must be willing to be interviewed by an adoption counselor and you must undergo an in person or virtual home visit from an RHS representative.\n\tComplete Application. https://www.richardsonhumanesociety.org/adopt/\n\tPhone Interview. Compatible applicants will be forwarded to a counselor who will contact the applicant for a phone interview.\n\tHome Visit. If all the steps above are completed satisfactorily, we will set up a visit where you can meet the pet you are interested in. We will try to include the foster parent so you can learn more about how the pet is in a home environment.\n\tComplete Adoption. If all feel it is a good match, we will schedule the adoption at your home or an off-site location. The applicant will need to complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies (under 1 year) and $125 for cats. Discounts are available for senior-aged pets.",

She does well with dog savy cats also, although she will bark and paw at them alittle to initiate play. She is not food or toy aggressive. Probably best with kids who are alittle older (12+) because she jumps when she's excited and will run into your legs when she greets you or playing. She sleeps in her kennel all the way through the night, although sometimes she will cry for a few minutes when she is first put in. After all, humans are here thing, and being in the kennel is being away from her peeps. She loves to give hugs and kisses first thing in the morning. She had a few accidents in the house, but nothing in the last two weeks. She is learning about the bell on the door trick and catching on quickly. She is a very smart girls that needs a loving home with people who can help her burn off some energy.",

She gets along with most all the dogs with the proper introduction. \n\nAs part of Peanut's $250 adoption fee, she is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and current on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. If you have questions about this sweet girl, you can email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Peanut, you can fill in an online application for her under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org.",

            "description": "Bonita would like you to know one thing... giving birth is tough. Giving birth in the back of a moving vehicle is WAY tough! Sweet Bonita found herself pregnant and at her wit's end in an overcrowded Oklahoma shelter. Pulled for rescue and en route to Muddy Paws, Bonita settled in for her long ride to freedom. Now, whether it was the vibration of the vehicle or the relaxation of rescue we'll never know... Either way, Bonita decided it was as good a time as any to bring her 11 little surprises into the world! This set off a change of plans as the transport had to turn around and head back to Oklahoma so that Bonita and her babies could ALL be deemed healthy and ready for travel. Whew! After all that, Bonita and family are finally here, safe and cozy in a foster home. Bonita is rockin' the new mom life and we'll have more updates about her over the coming weeks! *Please note: We are currently accepting applications for Bonita but she will not be available for physical adoption until she is finished caring for her pups.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Bonita is $400. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Pooky has puppy energy and is at the perfect age to begin obedience training.  He is very busy and would do best with another dog with whom to play. \nHe is new to the rescue and his profile will be updated as we get to know him better!\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Pooky, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nPooky\u2019s adoption fee is $400 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.\u00a0\u00a0The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.\u00a0\u00a0Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.\u00a0\u00a0Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.\u00a0\u00a0We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human.\nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason.",

They knew no one would dare try to reclaim her, given her conditions. They would be instantly charged with animal cruelty. Their very first instinct was bait dog. Noel had bite marks all over her head and legs. Her teeth are worn down, she's been bred over and over and she's emaciated. But really we have no idea Noel's story or how she ended up at the shelter.\n\nShe's clearly had a really rough life. She loves people and is very sweet. But just doesn't like other dogs. Can we blame her? She's never known kindness.\n\nAre you the one to give her the happily ever after she deserves? Please apply online today!\n\n** Thank-you Joyce for your Sponsorship donation for Noel!! Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

He LOVES to cuddle in your lap when he isn't playing. Ice rides well in the car. He doesn't like his crate & will need work training with it. This boy is a total sweetheart! He will make an excellent active companion!\n\n\n\nIce, his mom, and his sisters were all picked up as strays and taken to a high kill shelter in Alabama.  These great dogs were never reclaimed.  The shelter staff loved them because all of them were so sweet and calm.  We saw a video of them and we had to go and save them!   \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have!

Emails that don't include your location may not receive a response. \n\nIf you send more than one email you will not receive a response. It clogs our inbox up and slows down our response time.\n\nMeet Frisco. This cute 1-2 year od, little 10lb fluffy boy had been running loose and was trapped by a good citizen.  While Frisco is adorable, he does have some behavioral challenges.  His most serious challenge is an adversion to strangers and he will bark, chase and display ankle biter tendencies.   He also is territorial and has barrier reactivity which may subside since he is now neutered. Frisco's good qualities are that he does warm up quickly when taken out of his territory and once he gets to know you, he will be your protector.  He also has been good with other dogs and cats as well.  Frisco has been neutered, vaccinated, tested negative for heartworm, dewormed, microchipped, on flea and tick preventative and heartworm preventative.  He is now available for adoption to a very special quiet, low traffic home with no children and someone that is willing to set him up for success. Frisco is leash trained, crate trained and working on potty training.\n\nA home check is required. Yolo County adopters preferred, but will consider other locations. If you are more than 100 miles away from Yolo County please be aware that there may be a small additional expense associated with travel cost. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Frisco, email us and we will send you an adoption application. (include your location in the email) The adoption fee for Frisco is $250. \n\n*Vetting includes: Neuter/spay, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, heartworm test, flea preventative, heart worm preventative (including the remainder of their 6-month supply), and any other necessary vet care.",

            "description": "Fonteyn was rescued from under a car.  She danced her way into the rescuer's heart, but doesn't care for his dogs, so is waiting for God to send her forever family.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Jan. 2020, Fonteyn weighs about 15 lb.  Although she's initially timid, once she attaches herself to her person she wants to be where they are.  \n\nFonteyn would prefer to be an only dog.  She doesn't mind dogs her size, but doesn't like to share her people (resource guarding).  She'll growl at her favorite doggy friends if they come too close when she's on her person's lap.  \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

He was a very well loved dog which can be seen in his trust of people. He is blind and during his time in rescue it was discovered that one of his eyes had a pretty severe case of glaucoma so had to be removed. He does well on a leash, does not mind the crate, is housebroken and learned how to use the dog door in his foster home quickly. He has a very gentle temperament and is not an excessive barker. Paco is around 10 years old and around 10lbs. He is very sweet and friendly kind-hearted. He likes having lap time but is also pretty independent and very adaptable. He would fit into many different types of homes...maybe yours?",

            "description": "When you first meet DONOVAN, he melts your heart with those gorgeous brown and blue eyes and his warm, friendly demeanor. He will walk right up to you with his tail wagging and lean in close for some hands-on attention. He loves being loved! Just 2.5 years old and about 60lbs, this sweet, friendly lab mix would do best in a home where someone is home most of the day, i.e. a guardian who has a home office or is semi-retired, etc. He needs at least one friendly, low/medium energy canine companion to help with confidence building and learning the ropes, together with a fenced-in yard where they can play or chillax and enjoy the sights and sounds of the seasons.\n\nHis guardian describes him as follows: \"Donovan is just an awesome, loveable, and super sweet boy who is going to be someone's Furever Heart Dog. He's snuggly and affectionate and loves his people. Donovan wouldn't make a good jogging or high intensity hiking buddy. He is generally a mellow fellow but enjoys a good ball game outdoors and a casual walk. Generally a quiet pup, he may be talkative when he wants to play ball with you. He'll lay down with a ball and beckon you to come and throw it for him to chase. Once he gets it, more often than not, he'll lay down and bark to me to come get the ball and throw it again. He may be fine with cats since when he met them at boarding last week, he was a scaredy cat. AND he loves meeting new people. The moment he spots someone new, he starts wiggling his butt and wagging his tail and working his way toward them to say hello and share a moment.\"\n\nDONOVAN hasn't received much training in his life. His foster has been working on some basic commands and where to go potty, and he's doing great. He is treat and praise motivated and would benefit from some positive reinforcement training and mental enrichment activities. He isn't crate trained and doesn't like it at all. He may do best in a gated, dog friendly area when left unsupervised.\n\nDONOVAN is neutered and up to date on age-appropriate shots. His adoption fee is $425. which includes a spay/neuter fee. Please note that training is highly recommended for all young dogs.\n\nAs with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing. Visit WWW.LULUSRESCUE.ORG for an overview of Lulu's Rescue adoption process and/or to request an adoption application.\n\nThanks for adopting and saving a life!",

He is great with all other children and adults, it just seems to be this child. It may be the loudness and high energy common in this age group. He is also great with all dogs and we think he is okay with cats. Andy is housetrained and can be left with the run of the house while you work if necessary, he does not get into any trouble. We do prefer he has a fenced in yard due to his breed and no children under the age of 15. Andy is about three years old and weighs 44 lbs, a nice manageable size. His adoption fee is $175. He will make an wonderful best friend. If interested in Andy, please email hartmanshounds@gmail.com.",

            "description": "MEET CORKY! He is a little Italian Greyhound mix. Corky is only 2 years old and weighs 6.5 pounds. Corky is being fostered in Titusville, FL.\nDue to Covid-19 all dogs fostered in the state of Florida must be adopted within the State of Florida.\n\n\nUPDATED BIO 01/10/2021: Who would have thought that an adorable, tiny little Italian Greyhound Mix would be in a Yorkie rescue group? When you know there is a shelter dog that needs you, one who needs to be out of the shelter and in a quiet, safe place, there is no question that our hearts would open up to little Corky and make him our first United Yorkie Rescue Italian Greyhound Mix rescue boy.\n\nCorky was found by Animal Control wandering the streets back in late December no microchip was found. He was posted on the shelter website and he waited and waited for his family to come find him and take him home. No one came for him. This tiny dog didn't belong in a shelter with so many big loud dogs. Finally, the shelter was ready to put him up for adoption, then their vet resigned and there was no one to neuter Corky. The shelter knew the only place for him was a rescue and so this little guy became a United Yorkie Rescue dog.\n\nCorky has only been in his foster home for several days, but that is long enough for his foster family to know that he is the sweetest little boy and they already adore him. He yearns to be around his new foster family and loves to be held and cuddled and snuggled under the covers at night. Corky likes to talk to his family - not a bark or whine - but something in between. He is most likely letting them know how much he appreciates being rescued and finding a temporary loving family to show him that he is safe and that he will never ever end up in a shelter again. His foster family is working with him on reinforcing house-training. He is young and smart and will catch on quickly.\n\nCorky didn't take long to make himself right at home. He hopped right into the bed as if that's what he is supposed to do, and proceeded to sit in a chair at the dinner table. Why not? Of course, this isn't proper puppy protocol, and he is learning house manners and catching on quickly. He thought when he saw one of the resident chickens in the yard that he was supposed to chase it, but that's a no-no lol! The Italian Greyhound is classified as a sight hound, so it's best that Corky's forever family only have perhaps one other dog. Cats, rabbits, etc. would probably not be a good idea. Corky prefers the company of the humans in the home over the other dogs in the home, so he would also be fine as an only doggie.\n\nBecause Corky really loves attention from his foster family, it would be nice for him to have a home with at least one stay-at-home parent. Italian Greyhounds are highly social dogs and love attention from their family. Corky still needs to be neutered and have some deciduous baby teeth pulled, and once that is done, he will be ready for his forever home. There is so much more to learn about this sweet little boy, so come back soon to learn more about him.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to Corky's small size, he needs an adult only home or a home with children over the age of 13. Keep in mind Corky is very young and since he has already lost one family, his forever family needs to be one that will be with him for his expected life span of 15 years or more.\n",

I came to AHF will Jill, who is also a Bassett Hound mix. We are very close and do not like being away from each other, so we are looking to get into a home together. I am neutered, current on my vaccinations, and I am microchipped. Jill and I are even good with cats. As I mentioned, Jill and I need to go into a home together, but what is better than double the fun. We both love people and love to have fun. One thing about me is that I did test positive for heartworm, but I have already been treated and am doing well.\n\nIf you are looking for a pair of fun-loving characters, please check us out. You will not be sorry.\n\n\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the suburbs surrounding Schaumburg (Illinois Residents only)\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

            "description": "Meet Blue... the most Will Ferrell of dogs. He embodies Will from the movies Elf to Step Brothers. His goofy personality is so fun and derpy. He wants everyone to be his friend. At 65lbs and 2 years old Blue doesn't have many secrets in life, he lays all of his feelings out on the table. From his dying cow impersonating (shared walls are not a great idea) to his clumsy antics, Blue is an awesome dog that just needs some fine tuning (Such as maybe Ricky Bobby). He needs some work in the areas of knocking him down a peg... in his words \"I'm kind of a big deal\" he's got a giant head (literally and figuratively) and wants all the attentions. He also talks back but doesn't win most arguments. If he has experienced something unfavorable to him, he will tell you all about it. He is just so smooshy and lovable, full of wrinkles and fun. He's pretty much a overgrown puppy learning how to use his paws and mouth gently. His foster mom calls him an idiot, but Buddy the Elf would call him a Cotton Headed Ninny Muggins. He is great with all dogs, a little scared of cats and with humans, he's never met one he didn't like, however tiny human are probably not a good idea because he has no idea where his body his at and he sits where he pleases. Even if that is on their head. This boy deserves some adventures! Give him a try - you will not be disappointed. Blue's adoption fee is $350 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

It's time for Max to have his very own home so he can run around. He has gone through some awesome training, he knows lots of commands plus so much more, and the rescue will continue his training for life for FREE....\n\nWhy have I not found a family? I'm about 2-3 years old, and I am a quick learner (especially if you have treats!) I don't react to the dogs around me and I'm already neutered, and up-to-date on shots. I love water, toys, car rides, puppacinos, and just being a dog. However, I feel sad, depressed, and lonely each day and night when people leave and I'm once again in my kennel alone with nothing to do. This Phoenix heat is terrible and all I want is to have a home with air conditioning, love, a secure yard, lots of toys, yummy treats, and someone who will spend time with me. I get overexcited sometimes, I will feel much more secure, confident, calm, and will be your loyal companion. I told you I am a quick learner, so much that my best friend Bob is teaching me to dance!\n\nHe's friendly and likes most dogs but he needs to go to a home with no other pets. He will do best as an ONLY DOG at this time........ Max is great with older children since he gets excited at time 12+ years, Even though he's a really good boy, Max is always eager to learn more. A comfy bed, new bowls and a bag of treats will accompany Max to his new home. And of course he'll bring along his favorite toy.\n\nMax would love to have his own yard and family to love. No apartments or Condo's/townhomes\n\nMax need to have a home with a backyard, he likes to run around and play with secure fencing.\n\nContact 480-359-7109 for more information\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

Gorgeous Farlo, with his beautiful markings, is good with people, and, after a slow introduction, other dogs and even cats, although he would do best with older children. Farlo is housebroken, he loves riding in the car and walks well on a leash. He enjoys playing with other dogs and with his toys, especially his stuffies! Farlo has low vision, but it doesn't stop him from any adventures or activities. Farlo's forever home will be in the suburbs with an experienced owner who will continue to provide him with the structure and exercise he needs to be his very best self. To bring this happy, stunning boy into your life, please apply online at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Name: Bella\nSuspected Breed: Lab/Pointer Mix\nApproximate Age: 4 years old\nApproximate Weight: 61 lbs\nObservations with Dogs: Reactive on leash, but has done well with other dogs with proper intro\nObservations with Cats: Too interested in kitties \nObservations with Kids: Best in a home without children\nCurrently Living at: DC-area foster home\n\nSee Bella's adoption video here: https://youtu.be/h7OOGYp-wv0\n\nPlease meet our beautiful Bella! She is loyal, sweet, and playful, and she has so much love to give. Even though she is 60 pounds, she still thinks of herself as a lap dog. She loves belly rubs and generally any kind of scratches. \n\nBecause of her anxiety and reactivity, Bella needs a calm home without children. This means that if you have children under the age of 15, frequently have children in your home, or are planning on having children, she is probably not the dog for you. She also needs slow introductions to visitors, whatever their age.\n\nShe's smart and eager to please, which makes her highly trainable. Bella is a very energetic dog, so she needs an adopter who either is active and can take her running or can commit to lots of play. If her adopter is not a runner, she'll need a fenced-in yard to play with her adopter to supplement daily long walks.\n\nBella does beautifully in the home when there is no chaos and she has had plenty of exercise. She thrives on routine and predictability. In the right home with plenty of exercise, Bella is a calm girl who loves to snuggle. She can live in the city with someone who is willing and able to work with her on-leash reactivity, but she would also do very well in a more suburban or rural area. Bella has previously done well both in rural areas and in urban areas with appropriate training.\n\nBella is doing well in her foster home and is very affectionate. Her foster reports that she loves to keep him company on her sofa while he works and that when she's happy, her tail goes in circles like a propeller. Bella has done well in the crate with positive reinforcement and has not had any accidents in her foster homes. She is a highly intelligent dog and enjoys puzzle toys. \n\nBella is working with her foster on leash reactivity. While she likes other dogs with proper introduction and has been fostered with other canines in the home, she gets scared and nervous when she sees other dogs on a leash. When that happens, she sometimes pulls on her leash, whines, or barks. Right now we are taking Bella on walks in the early morning and later at night in order to avoid other dogs until she is more comfortable. We also have enlisted the help of a top area trainer who specializes in reactivity. With patience and positive reinforcement, she has already improved dramatically.\n\nWhile she would do fine as an only dog, Bella really likes to play with other dogs that she knows and likes. She needs to be properly introduced to other dogs and doesn't take to all dogs she meets. If you have a dog who could use a companion to wear them out, Bella may be the dog for you!\n\nBella needs an adopter who is willing to consistently help her cope with fears, which she is exhibiting less and less but will always need some management. We recommend additional work with a trainer for her with her adopter, since training is about teaching the human as much as it is about teaching the dog! A class also has the benefit of building a closer bond between dog and human. We want to ensure her forever family continues to reinforce the positive behaviors and helps Bella continue to build confidence.\n\nBella requires a diet free of chicken, and she takes medication to manage her allergies. She has suffered from persistent ear infections and allergies. We have figured out the right combination of diet, medication, and ear maintenance, and it has really helped her disposition.\n\nLike most shelter dogs, Bella may need a refresher on house training and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS' fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350. If you are interested in adopting Bella, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/.ABOUT US & IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPlease note that you must use our official adoption application in order to be considered for adoption. Applying through other sites (i.e., Petfinder) will not work. The following are our applications:\n\nDog application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=1\nCat application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=6\n\nDC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.\n\nOur shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and are completely transparent about any known issues prior to adoption finalization. \n\nABOUT DC PAWS RESCUE\n\nOur rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based dog and cat rescue in the DC area. We rescue locally from Prince Georges County, MD, and from rural shelters in the south (presently Pickens County, Anderson County, and Greenville County in SC, and Raleigh County, WV).\n\nWe partner with a local rescuer in Pickens County, SC, who saves adoptable cats and dogs from the three area shelters. For the animals in this rural area, rescue is a critical lifeline, and often the only lifeline. Our rescue partner not only works with DC PAWS to save as many dogs and cats as possible, but she has also established a successful spay/neuter program in the community to decrease the number of homeless and unwanted animals over the long term.\n\nFOSTER AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFosters make it possible for DC PAWS to save and care for homeless, neglected and abandoned animals! To learn about fostering dogs or cats for DC PAWS Rescue, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/volunteer/fostering/foster-application\n\nSPONSOR AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFor any of our animals! Sponsors help us provide critical medical care, food, boarding, and other support for animals facing euthanasia. Individuals who sponsor a dog or cat receive special recognition on the animal's profile. Sponsorships can also be made in honor or memory of a loved one, and you may designate to whom DC PAWS Rescue should provide notice of your gift. Sponsorship levels of $250 and $150 include \"\"naming rights\"\" for a future dog or cat (respectively) that we rescue.\n\nTo learn more about sponsorship, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/donate/",

This is very disturbing to us as he is only 7 weeks old and puppies should not be adopted out until 8 weeks. We had no choice but to take him in early considering the other siblings fate.We know that he is very, very shy. Cannot look at you in the eyes and very scared at first. We are still monitoring his behavior to see how long before he will come out of his shell. He will be available for adoption on Feb. 10th. By then, we will have a good idea of how his personality is. We can start reviewing applications in the meantime.\nmuttsandrunts.org/application",
