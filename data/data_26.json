            "description": "Spunky and sweet. Fun loving and cuddly. Playful and friendly. Loves her people, loves her doggie friends and loves her kitties as well. Edith (Edie) is the perfect family pet and companion. She's highly trainable and picks up new commands and routines quickly. Edie is housetrained but is still learning to signal when she needs to go out. She absolutely loves to play and a home with a yard where she can get the zoomies or enjoy a good game of fetch would be ideal for Edie. She's crate trained and although she is a full-on puppy, she can settle down after working off some of her energy. Edie will need to work on manners such as not being mouthy or jumping up but she has already shown signs of being able to break these puppy habits quickly and she is working on basic commands such as sit and wait. Edie has a big, loveable personality and will definitely bring joy to any home. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  While this Lab may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. \n\nFor more information on this Lab, please contact INFO@BROOKLINELABRESCUE.ORG.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, www.brooklinelabrescue.org, for more information on our adoption process.

So far we know that she is about 1 years old and weighs 50lbs and has been good around people and other dogs.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Lakin, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Lakin, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgLakin. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

He is working on his potty skills and if very friendly with other dogs.\n\nRemo is approx 2 yrs old\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Breed mix info is the best guess of ScratchMyBelly and our vets. There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test, so we have no way to know whether or not this dog is \"hypoallergenic\". Since he/she is a mixed breed, and could have as many as 4-5 breeds in his/her mix, it is safest to assume this dog is NOT hypoallergenic.\nHomes with doggie doors will not be approved, sorry we are seeing a lot of problems with unsupervised animals and wild life.\n\nWe require a Home Check to set you & our Dog up for a successful transition into his/her furever home. This is only about the safety of the dog & in no way a judgement of you or your home. Our contract states that should you not want our Dog for ANY reason we will happily take our Dog back into our Rescue.\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\n1. Submit Application\nGo to our website www.scratchmybelly.org/forms. Your application is not a guarantee of placement, our process is not first come, first serve and we have the right to refuse the application. If you \u201crent\u201d please make sure you check with your Landlord you can have a pet prior to submitting your application, many landlords have weight and/or breed restrictions.\n\n2. Interview\nWe endeavor to make sure we are matching you with the right dog so a phone interview helps to insure we are all on the same page.\n\n3. Meet the Pet\nWe can Meet n Greet at Home Check or you meet the foster. Every situation is different. We try to accommodate each on a personal level.\n\n4. Home Check\nWe check for safety for the dog. We know our dogs well & can spot a potential problem quickly. We also call this a meet n greet.\n\n5. Sign Adoption Contract\nContracts are signed the day of adoption, we accept PayPal to the Rescue Group & the Dog goes to his new home.\n\nDue to the hundreds of inquires we cannot guarantee anything. ALL THE APPLICATIONS ARE SENT TO THE FOSTER FOR REVIEW.   IF THE FOSTER CHOOSES YOUR HOME FOR ONE OF OUR DOGS, SHE WILL \"CALL YOU\" WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIVING YOUR APPLICATION.   OTHERWISE, YOU WILL NOT HEAR FROM THE FOSTER.\n\nIt does not help us if you are sending us multiple emails, texts and calls. \nWe are a volunteer based rescue organization.\n\n",

Rocky will most likely need a little time to settle in as he can be a bit worried in new situations. Once comfortable, he's happy to sit on your lap or ask you to shake hands. He may be able to live with another dog, but he can be particular about who he likes to be friends with, a mellow dog would be the best fit for this good boy. And of course this means that Rocky will not be a dog park kind of guy nor will he want to meet every dog he may see. With a slow introduction, Rocky can have a cat friend in his new home and as an extra bonus, he has a good history around chickens. He says older kids are fine as long as they give him some space while he settles in. If you think Rocky might be for you, please start by filling out the form that is provided in the link below. mspca.org/nevinsadoptioninquiry",

            "description": "Simone, our wild child! And we say that with lots of love in our heart! She is aaaalllll the things - young, energetic, frustrated, adorable, silly. The shelter is such a tough environment for Simone... she sits in her kennel all day watching people and other dogs go by and her frustration grows and grows. We need to get this little nugget into a foster home stat! Simone is such a different pup when she is away from her kennel and other dogs. She's wiggly, affectionate, trying to get as close to her person as possible. Simone gives the sweetest kisses, and offers up her precious little belly to get rubbed... of course, we oblige! At just over a year old, Simone is still pretty much a puppy, and puppies should not grow up in the shelter. We have no doubt that once Simone is in a home, and has time to catch up on her sleep and decompress, she will be such a lovely - and silly! - companion. She arrived as a stray so we don't have home notes on her but of course we are here to offer you all the support and tools you need to set her up for success! An ideal home for Simone is with an active person/family who will exercise both her body and her brain. A house with a fenced yard would be ideal. Simone is likely too much doggo for young kids. Let's get this youngin out of a kennel and into a home so she can flourish and learn and just get to be a dog! I weigh approximately 45 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

            "description": "My name is Opal! I kind of have it all... I am fun, smart and affectionate. I have heard people describe be as a very sweet dog that just needs the right home to thrive in. I am a young dog and still have a lot of puppy energy. I tend to get mouthy and jumpy when excited or when I am being ignored, so I cannot live in a home with children under the age of 12. I can be loud when left a lone so I am not suitable for an apartment and will need a fenced in yard in my next home. Because of my rough playstyle, I should not go to a home with cats. I am required to meet all household residents, including any dogs, before going to my forever home. Opal is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Opal A1320612 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

Hercules is a big, strong boy who is learning how to use his power to be a hero, but he needs a guiding hand and a happy home to become the best! He will need a little work on leash, but will always try his hardest! Come meet Hercules today and you will find the best champion, the best protector, the best Hero you will ever know! \u201cI will face the world, fearless, proud, and strong\u2026I can go the distance.\u201d\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n\n\n",

Her teeth have been ground down, and we don't know how it happened -- it could have been done by a cruel person using her as a \"bait dog,\" or from chewing from inside a metal cage. Whatever happened, the important thing now is that she hasn't let that trauma destroy her trust in humans. Quite the contrary -- she loves affection and is in heaven when she gets to cuddle or be petted. She has done well with other dogs here at the shelter, so bring yours over for a meet-and-greet. She's spayed, microchipped and up to date on her shots. Abby deserves a loving home where she will see only the good side of people, and she'll reward you with total devotion (and that beautiful smile). Please come see sweet Abby!",

She was surrendered to The Animal Care Society by her previous owners because she was too much for their small senior dog. Miami likes to play rough so if she goes to a home with other dogs, they will need to be able to keep up with her. She is very strong and doesn't have great leash manners, so she needs a home with a fenced-in yard. She also loves to play with toys and chew on bones. If you are interested in meeting Miami, head over to our website www.animalcaresociety.org and submit an application.\n*Miami cannot go home until after her spay, which is scheduled for 2/3/21. Primary Color: Tan Weight: 51lbs Age: 1yrs 3mths 0wks I am available for adoption at the Animal Care Society.",

I am just maybe 6 months old; my foster brother said that my feet indicate I might be on the larger size. I think I will be a perfect what ever size I grow to. I will most likely be the size of a Boxer, for that is what I am, with some Mastiff and Heinz 57 mixed in. \nI eat in my crate, I have a slow eating bowl, I tend to gulp my food, and my foster mom tells me that is not good for me. I eat two times a day, if you leave food out, I will eat it.  I just can not help myself.  \nI have a foster fur brother, he is a Mastiff, (we are not related,) we play inside and outside together. I have had no accidents in the house, and go out several times a day. I am used to being in my crate, I do require a treat to get in. \nI had a forever family, but they couldn\u2019t keep me, they surrendered me to 4 the Love of K9\u2019s. I had other dogs there that I played with, and a young child too. I don\u2019t know if I like cats or not, haven\u2019t been around one, I don\u2019t think. \nI need bones, toys and kongs to chew on, I like to chew. Foster mom said something about I could possibly be cutting more teeth. Speaking of teeth, I play hard, I would do better with a family who are familiar with Bully breeds. My foster mom says, I need boundaries. A fur brother or two would be fun, they need to be about 60 pounds and like to wrestle. A fenced yard is a must too. \nI have been vetted and spayed, and am excited about a new adventure with my forever family. \nI don\u2019t know if I like to walk on a leash, foster mom and I haven\u2019t done this. I suspect I will like walking and seeing the sites. \n\nIf you would like to meet Sarah send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...spay, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam.",

She walks well on her leash, and she's quite a lover -- she's always happy to sit by your side (or cuddle in your lap) and enjoy hugs and kisses! She needs a home with no cats, but she's friendly with other dogs here at the shelter, so bring yours over for a meet-and-greet.  She knows how to sit and has a gorgeous blue and white coat. She's already spayed, microchipped and up to date on her shots. She's a big girl with a big heart, and she'd love to meet you today -- please come on over and see Athena!",

He is a senior at 10 years old but in good health despite a little arthritis.  His ideal home would be a retired couple or senior that would spend a lot of time with him loving on him and spoiling him.  He is ok with larger children but small children hugging  and squeezing him is not his thing.  If you are interested in meeting him please email:  \npifanimal@yahoo.com\n",

            "description": "Meet Butters! He is approx 1-2 yrs old and about 6-7 lbs, he was rescued from the streets of TJ. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and dewormed. He is doing really good at potty training and he is already a professional cuddler.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Breed mix info is the best guess of ScratchMyBelly and our vets. There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test, so we have no way to know whether or not this dog is \"hypoallergenic\". Since he/she is a mixed breed, and could have as many as 4-5 breeds in his/her mix, it is safest to assume this dog is NOT hypoallergenic.\n\n\nHomes with doggie doors will not be approved, sorry we are seeing a lot of problems with unsupervised animals and wild life.\n\nWe require a Home Check to set you & our Dog up for a successful transition into his/her furever home. This is only about the safety of the dog & in no way a judgement of you or your home. Our contract states that should you not want our Dog for ANY reason we will happily take our Dog back into our Rescue.\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\n1. Submit Application\nGo to our website www.scratchmybelly.org/forms. Your application is not a guarantee of placement, our process is not first come, first serve and we have the right to refuse the application. If you \u201crent\u201d please make sure you check with your Landlord you can have a pet prior to submitting your application, many landlords have weight and/or breed restrictions.\n\n2. Interview\nWe endeavor to make sure we are matching you with the right dog so a phone interview helps to insure we are all on the same page.\n\n3. Meet the Pet\nWe can Meet n Greet at Home Check or you meet the foster. Every situation is different. We try to accommodate each on a personal level.\n\n4. Home Check\nWe check for safety for the dog. We know our dogs well & can spot a potential problem quickly. We also call this a meet n greet.\n\n5. Sign Adoption Contract\nContracts are signed the day of adoption, we accept PayPal to the Rescue Group & the Dog goes to his new home.\n\nDue to the hundreds of inquires we cannot guarantee anything. ALL THE APPLICATIONS ARE SENT TO THE FOSTER FOR REVIEW.   IF THE FOSTER CHOOSES YOUR HOME FOR A PUPPY, SHE WILL \"CALL YOU\" WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIVING YOUR APPLICATION.   OTHERWISE, YOU WILL NOT HEAR FROM THE FOSTER.\n\nIt does not help us if you are sending us multiple emails, texts and calls. \nWe are a volunteer based rescue organization.\n\n\n",

Submit application to meet dog if interested - yes an application is required********\n\nRequired: Sturdy physical fenced yard as this boy loves to run and play but will climb a 4 ft chain link fence. A buddy for him to play with would be great.\n\nSunny is (best guess) a lab mix who is 10 mths old and around 45 lbs. He has ears that are designed to make you smile every time you see him. \nSunny is one big happy kid! He is full of personality and will 'talk' to the foster. He also is a shadow to her if allowed and enjoys cuddles and she says shows nothing but love and devotion to her. He loves to play with the other dogs and toys. He especially loves playing fetch with a ball. He is learning to play less rough with kitties, so probably no cats in his forever home. He bonds quickly and is completely house-trained. He uses the dog door easily and loves his time outside, especially if one of his buddies is out there, too. He enjoys treats and learns new things pretty quickly.  He needs an active home and no toddlers/young kids as he is higher energy. He will climb a 4 ft chain link fence so more solid or higher fencing is needed. If you would like to meet this adorable pup an application must be filled out https://www.cognitoforms.com/New2URescues/AdoptionApplication\n\nYou can learn more about our rescue and process at www.new2urescue.org or find us on facebook at https://new2urescue.org/adoption/adoption-application/ must be filled out to meet one of our dogs.  You must be 25 yrs of age or older to adopt through us. We are in the Rochester NY area and adopt dogs out to area residents.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.cognitoforms.com/New2URescues/AdoptionApplication\nAn application must be filled out to meet any of our dogs, to apply go to \nhttp://new2urescue.org/adoption/adoption-application/ so foster can contact you. We do not have a shelter, dogs are in foster homes.\n\nAll animals are kept in foster homes so there is no shelter for you to visit animal. Please go to https://new2urescue.org/adoption/adoption-application/ if you would like to meet the foster animal or learn more.\n\nAll our dogs have been spayed/neutered; treated for worms; heartworm tested (if age appropriate -7 mths or older); treated for fleas/ticks; microchip; and examined by veterinarian and given age appropriate vaccinations. We take every effort to ensure the health of the animal and you will receive a copy of all vet work performed.\n\nYou can find us on Face Book at https://www.facebook.com/New2Urescue and our main website at https://www.new2urescue.org\n\nNew 2 U Rescue is registered as a New York State Shelter / Rescue.

Sophie is a little less energetic than her younger sibling, so they would prefer a quieter home.\n\nSophie is 9yo, black and white female pom mix. When she first came into foster, she could not walk very well, but as she has been slowly introduced to more exercise, her joints have improved! She now can take short walks and is able to walk across hardwood floors. The vet checked her out and said she needs gentle exercise to keep her joints strengthened. She's in great health overall!  She a sweet, loving, calm girl. Rarely barks.\n\nSantanna is a 7yo male tan pom mix. He is playful and fun with a medium energy level. He is more outgoing than Sophie. The vet says he's in great shape! He's sweet and spunky, and his foster notes he rarely barks.\n\nThe adoption donation amount is for both Sophie and Santanna together. Please contact us if you would like to welcome this adorable pair into your home.",

I am a total sweetheart once I warm up to you! I am a little nervous here, but I\u2019m sure I will come out of my shell once I get used to a home environment. Once I\u2019m feeling comfortable, I really like to play! I\u2019m a sweet girl, who really wants to have a best friend! I think I would fit well into almost any family, so please ask about me today!\n\nLeash: needs work\nObedience: needs work\nContainment: a fenced in yard\nWith other Dogs: unknown\nWith cats: unknown\nWith small children: unknown\n\n\nAdoption comes with:\n\n* Mandatory spaying/neutering\n* First license\n* Veterinarian check-up\n* First vaccinations\n* Tattoo\n* Microchip implant\n* 6 weeks of free pet insurance\n* Small bag of dog food\n* De-worming for young pups\n * Literature on responsible pet ownership.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n** IMPORTANT NOTICE **\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, dog adoptions are currently being done by appointment only. Contact 311 to schedule an appointment. Thank you!\n\n______________________________\n\nCome Meet Our Adoptable Dogs...\nWinnipeg Animal Services Agency\n1057 Logan Avenue\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nR3E 3N8\n\nPhone: 311 - outside Winnipeg dial 1-877-311-4974 \n\nEmail: animalservicesagency@winnipeg.ca\n\nOur hours for adoption are Monday to Friday from 11:00 am - 5:30 pm\nSaturday & Sunday from 12:00 pm - 4:30pm.\nAnimal Services is closed on statutory holidays.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAlmost all the dogs at Animal Services are picked up as strays running loose on the streets of Winnipeg and therefore they come to us with no known history. For this reason, we are not sure how they will interact with other dogs, cats or how they are with children. We would suggest that if you have younger children you bring them down with you to meet the dogs. We also have an outdoor play area where we can do introductions with any other dogs that live in the home.\n\nAll locally adopted dogs come with a 7 day home trial. If you return the dog within this time period, you will be refunded your adoption fee less the non-refundable deposit.\n\nPlease feel free to meet all the dogs and puppies outside of their kennels, just let the kennel attendants know that you would like a meet and greet with the dog outside of his pen. The dogs are much more relaxed when outside of their kennels. They would love to meet you!",

She has a nice disposition and is available for meet/greet only at this time. She will need booster vaccines and her spay surgery before leaving B&B. In the meanwhile, email your application to get an appointment to see her. Plan to bring the entire family and any other dog/s in the home.\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available.

            "description": "Allison, or Allie, is a very sweet, quiet little girl - 8-10 yrs old and 9-10 lbs. Came from a home - her family's health causes her to find another family. Poor eyesight, but she loves her walks- she'll even go on a walk when it's cold and windy! She is spending her time in our office with a few other small dogs - relaxing on a big pillow. She is taking proin to help her \"hold her water\" - might need to put a little doggie diaper on her. But maybe not - could be that the deteriorating health of her people was upsetting to her. She is usually good about where she does her business, as long as you pay attention to when she needs outside.\n\nAccording to the shelter she originally came from, she would be 7 and a half; but the family that gave her up thinks she must be older, up to 10, because of her eyesight and low energy level. Her teeth are bad and we plan on giving her a dental. She has trouble eating hard kibble.\n\nEmail your application to beaglesandbuddies.com - see \"adopt a dog\" section. She loves her senior people!\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com.

I may be able to have a canine friend outside of my home. I do well with male dogs and I am selective with female dogs. \n\nWhat do you think about cats? I have an unknown history with cats.\n\nSo how do you feel about kids? I would do best with older kids. I can be protective over my food. So I will need kids old enough to know to leave me alone while I eat.\n\nWhat's your energy level like? I have a medium to high energy level.\n\nWhat is it that staff and volunteers love about you? I am a sweet girl who enjoys yard time! I would prefer a home where my owner is home most of the time! \n\nIs there anything else we should know about you? I am 5 years old and I weigh between 60-65 pounds. I do have a behavior waiver the staff will discuss with you.\n\nI came into the shelter as a transfer and the above information is all recommendations based on my previous history and the behavior seen at the shelter. Expect to learn more about me after adoption.\nIt is unknown how this animal will do in their new home as all animals can be different with each person. It is important to take this into consideration when thinking about adopting and making sure you are prepared to work with any potential medical or behavior issues that occur after adoption.\n\nMy adoption fee includes my spay/neuter, current vaccinations, permanent microchip identification, certificate for a free veterinary exam, post-adoption support and more!\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! If you think we would be a good match call and ask about me! I'm looking for my forever home and it could be with you!\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION: If you live in the city of Eugene or in Lane County you will be purchasing a dog license in addition to the adoption fee. You will get to choose between a one year, two year, or three year license. \nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503. See all of the pets at this shelter by visiting www.green-hill.org.",

            "description": "Barney can be a bit hesitant when meeting new people, but once you've earned his trust he is playful and very energetic. This guy loves to run and jump- especially if he can jump on furniture to pose for the perfect picture. He likes to play fetch with toys and will bring it back and trade it for treats. He is food motivated and loves to learn new tricks for a treat. He gets very excited to sniff and see other dogs, which can lead to some pulling on the leash. With practice and positive reinforcement he can easily learn to walk perfectly. Once all worn out he loves to cuddle up next to you for a nap. Come and meet this sweet boy today!\n\nTo self-schedule an appointment to meet available animals at CHA Animal Shelter, visit:\nhttps://www.signupgenius.com/go/8050f4dadac2aa4fa7-adoption",

She loves kids and cats, but would be better in a single dog home. She is very timid and cautious of strangers but eventually warms up. She loves to play tug of war and eats ice cubes like treats! She prefers a couch or bed over the floor and loves to be wherever the people are. She is great in the car and on a leash, though she tends to get excited about squirrels and needs reminding to stay close. She chases lasers and light reflections just like a cat and will do it for hours if you let her! What a Doll!!!

I love to play fetch, cuddle in your lap, and of course run. I can be content to sit and chew on a toy bone or rope while you work, but I prefer to be close to you at all times.\n\nI may require a physically fenced in yard, pending your previous experience, location, or other plans for containment.\n\nI may match with another dog, pending a meet and greet. I was not interested in cats, but will need training to learn my boundaries with them. I am best suited with children 8+ that are use to being around herding/energetic breeds. I am NOT a fit for an apartment. I am not quite when I am kenneled and alone. I may lay down after a while but any commotion set me off barking again.\n\nI am beautiful and smart. I will make a great companion for the right situation.",

My previous owner found me in traffic last year, so not much is known about my history, but as best as the vet can tell, I am a Chihuahua, Jack Russel mix. I weigh fifteen pounds, and I\u2019m around 3 yrs. old! I am a very happy and loving boy. My favorite things include sniffing for treasures in the backyard, eating, and giving kisses. I am energetic, but also enjoy a good cuddle. I am very playful and submissive, making me an agreeable friend for other dogs. Kids are ok too but probably older would be best.  I\u2019m housebroken and crate trained and I\u2019m excited to find my forever home!\n\nIf you would like to meet Snitch send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

No out of state applicants, please. \n\nCrate Trained: Work in progress. He is very unhappy in the crate but if he\u2019s got a dog friend near him, for comfort, he does well. \n\nKids: No kids. Soup is child friendly but we\u2019ve witnessed some food resource guarding. We want to ensure a long term home so we think no young children is best. \n\nSoup is a super sweet boy that is still learning the ropes. He and his buddy Malcolm have been inseparable since they\u2019ve gone into their foster home together. We think Soup would benefit from another dog. \n\nSoup definitely has German Shepherd in him so he\u2019s got one of those personalities. He can be quite noisy at times. We\u2019d like Soup to go to a GSD experienced home who understands their traits. Soup really needs the security of living with another dog. \n\nHe\u2019s an overall really nice boy that should be a great addition to a family of GSD lovers. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Soup, please fill out an application at animalheartline.org and a volunteer will contact you.",

He is about 20 pounds right now but will certainly get bigger, probably to around 45 to 50 lbs. when full grown. He was found by one of our local Veterinarian and no one came forth to claim the cutie.  \n\nEarl is your typical happy, fun loving puppy!  He is sweet and loves to run around and play, especially with his Bully sticks.  Earl will need some basic training and structure to help him develop into a well-mannered adult dog as is needed with any puppy.  He is up to date on his vaccines and is neutered. \n\nPlease contact Animal Medical Center at 205-758-7295 to inquiry about this darling boy and on how to fill out their adoption application. \n\nThis animal is presently in the care of a person who hopes to find it a good home. The Humane Society of West Alabama does not sponsor or foster the animal, but provides this courtesy information to help the animal find a permanent home. Please contact the individual and not the organization.\n\nPlease note the Humane Society of West Alabama is not liable for the behavior of courtesy listing dogs.

            "description": "\nNova has been in the program for 4 weeks now and has 4 more weeks to go. He is a fun, playful pup who enjoys people and other dogs. Her ideal new home will have plenty of room for her to run and lots of activities to keep her busy. She is jealous of other dogs getting attention so a home with a limited number of existing dogs is required. She will growl and push the other dog out of the way.\n\n12/28/20--Nova is currently housed and enrolled in the Puppies for Parole Program at the Boonville Correction Center where (s)he will stay for 8 weeks of basic obedience training. (S)He will learn commands such as \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, \u201cheel\u201d, \u201ccome\u201d, etc. (S)He will learn crate and house training. Nova will be available for adoption while (s) he is in the Program, but will not be released to his/her new adopting family until the end of the 8 weeks when (s)he graduates. The adoption fee for a Puppies for Parole dog is $100. For questions regarding adoptions, call the Marshall Animal Shelter at (660)831-0420\n\nNova was originally found by a citizen at an abandoned gas station along a busy highway. They brought her back to their house where they unsuccessfully attempted to find her owner. They fostered her until the shelter had room to take her or find rescue placement for her. She was brought to the shelter after an altercation with one of the existing dogs in the home over a bone. She happily interacted with the families grandbaby who has Downs Syndrome. He's actually the one who named her! They report that she likes to go on walks and car rides.",

Loki is slowly getting used to being in the shelter, although he likes to bark at people if they walk by his kennel. Loki is suitable with children 10-years-old and up.

No out of state applicants, please. \n\nMalcolm is your average puppy who is sweet and cute as can be, but he\u2019s also quite mischievous. Malcolm loves to find things to chew and eat. He even finds things that it appears he only knows the hiding spots for. ?\n\nMalcolm was surrendered to a local animal control due to his family not having enough time for him. It appears he spent a good portion of his short life, in a crate. \n\nHe really likes other dogs but he\u2019s still working on his confidence. He\u2019s shy and worried when meeting new dogs but he\u2019s done amazing with all the dogs in his foster home. He just needs time to build more confidence. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Malcolm, please fill out an application at animalheartline.org and a volunteer will contact you.",

            "description": "Big Joe has been with us for a few weeks. When he initially came in, he was very thin and unable to put weight on his back left leg. During his stay here with us, he has gained weight, become more confident, and made some new human friends. He will need to \ncontinue to gain weight and muscle, which will help improve his mobility, but his left hind leg appears to have healed from previous trauma without residual pain. If pain begins in the future, a follow-up FHO type procedure may need to be considered. He has started on a joint supplement that should be maintained lifelong. Joe walks well on leash, appears to be semi-housebroken, and has the best smile! Other animals are unknown at this time; if placed with cats, we ask for a slow, well-managed introduction. Dogs are required to have a supervised visit with staff prior to adoption, as well as children. Due to Joe's previous leg injury, if placed with children, we ask that his interaction and play be monitored. If Joe is the big blue guy you've been searching for, please apply to meet him!",

            "description": "Champagne / Male / 10 Months / 24 lbs / Street Mix / Brampton\n\nMeet Champagne! Champagne and all his siblings were brought to a spay and neuter campaign in Puebla City, Mexico. Their owners later called to say they would not be coming back for them. The puppies had already overcome a lot, so the selfless volunteers decided to give them a second chance. They were taken to the loving care of our partner shelter where they were prepared to fly to Canada. When they were ready, they were flown here in search of forever homes!\n\nChampagne is the ultimate cuddle buddy and just wants to be close to his people. He loves tennis balls and cat toys that chirp! He is described as quiet, shy, affectionate, snuggly and social. He is always interested in what his people are doing and will follow his family from room to room. His ideal family would be home more often than not and have a confident doggy pal to show him the ropes!\n\nWith his family Champagne is a velcro dog. With new people he is shy but warms up quickly. He prefers if he is awarded the opportunity to come around on his own. He would be good with children, as long as the adults advocate for his space as needed. Paying close attention to his body language will be important for his comfort and success with all people.\n\nChampagne has some mild separation anxiety and will cry when his humans leave. Even though he prefers to be with his people - he will settle in his crate after a few minutes. He is a very good boy and is becoming more confident every day being alone. Champagne is still learning house manners and will counter surf if given the chance!\n\nOn leash he is naturally a good boy. He will walk calmly and closely next to his people. He is still very much a puppy and will need ongoing support with commands and obedience skills. He knows sit, stay, lie down and is working on his recall. He is medium energy and will need at least two walks a day plus additional time to use the washroom. Granted he has received adequate opportunities outside, he is fully potty trained.\n\nChampagne would do best in a detached house, with a fully fenced backyard. He would appreciate a safe and secured place to run and play with his canine siblings. He is easily startled by loud noises so he should always be supervised outdoors, and leashed if the space in not secured. The city would likely be overwhelming for Champagne, so he would prefer to be in the suburbs or quiet country. Champagne loves other dogs and cats!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Champagne please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nChampagne\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

            "description": "Boris / Male / 2 Years / 65 lbs / Catahoula Leopard Dog / Toronto\n\nMeet Boris! Boris comes to us all the way from Hohenwald, Tennesee! This handsome and gentle giant is the ultimate cuddle buddy. His tail is always wagging and he is happiest when near his people. Wherever his person goes - he is sure to be close behind and curious about what they\u2019re doing. He is described as shy, sweet, happy, friendly, calm, curious and affectionate. He loves playing with other dogs, chewing his bones, and exploring the outside. He would make the ultimate companion for an active family who shares his love of adventure!\n\nBoris is the ultimate gentleman and never jumps up on anyone. He is very excited when his family comes home but is always calm and respectful. With new people he will go in for a sniff, and generally warms up very quickly. Based on his nature, he would make an incredible dog to grow up with respectful children of all ages.\n\nBoris is currently getting 4 long walks a day. He is a working breed so he will need structured walks throughout the day to ensure he is successful. As long as he\u2019s had enough exercise, he is extremely well mannered in the home. Boris is also fully potty trained!\n\nWhen left alone Boris is crated and settles right away. Occasionally he whines a little at bedtime, but even then only takes a few minutes to settle completely. Once is comfortable he will sleep through the night without issue.\n\nOn leash Boris is a puller. He is a powerful dog so he should never be walked by children, only strong handlers. His leash etiquette should be a primary focus for his training moving forward. He is quite skittish outside and will jump or startle easily to loud noises. He will also need support with basic obedience and commands.\n\nBoris\u2019s ideal home would be a detached house, with a fully fenced backyard. He is used to wide open spaces to run and play, so would do best with a safely secured place to enjoy the outdoors. He could potentially adapt to an apartment if his family is committed to lots of exercise and mental stimulation throughout the day. Boris is only looking for homes outside of the city, where he can really start to thrive. Boris would do best with at least one other playful dog in the home, but has not been tested with cats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Boris please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nBoris\u2019s adoption fee is $700.

Then keep scrolling - this is not your dog! Clementine is a couch potato better suited to binge watching Netflix during a pandemic. She is an adult (~4 year old) Coonhound mix who loves laying on the couch, chewing on bones in the yard and taking short walks through the neighborhood. She loves other dogs but we don't know about cats or small pets. She is 100% hound and needs people who can be strong leaders and will understand her breed. She has shown some possessive behavior with toys but is easily redirected. Car rides are a big hit and she likes being tucked in with a blanket at bedtime. Clementine is a dog built for comfort, not speed. Spayed, microchipped and housebroken. Ready for your couch!\n\nDue to Godiva/Clementines size and resource guarding of toys we are asking for an adoptive family with large dog experience and kids over the age of 16.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs). Ruff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.

She also loves to sit right by your side (or in your lap!) and be petted, and to give you kisses on request. She's a \"leaner\" who will gently lean in on you to soak up all the loving she can get. She's medium-sized, with a gorgeous tan and white coat and \"mascara\" eyes. She's spayed, microchipped and up to date on her shots.

He loves his people and enjoys snuggling on the couch and sleeping in bed with them, but he's also crate trained and housebroken. In addition to snuggles, Henry loves to romp & play; we believe he'd benefit from a calm, playful, social dog companion who reads and respects other dogs' body language and verbal cues. As always, a meet and greet with resident & frequently visiting dogs is required. He is not good with cats or small dogs. We're recommending only older, respectful children ages 13+ at this time; due to his size, strength and energy. This cutie knows basic commands (sit, down & here), but could uses some help with his leash manners and relaxing on car rides. We believe Henry and his forever family would benefit from a basic training course with a professional trainer (we will provide suggestions on request); learning together is a great bonding experience!If your looking to add an adorable, sweet goof to your family, please fill out an application to meet handsome Henry today!Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

He would make the perfect companion for an active person. His foster says he enjoys watching TV, playing with his ball, and, most of all, belly rubs! We call him \"corn chip\" because of his tiny corn chip ears. Roscoe is a sweet boy looking for a home with a backyard. Apply to adopt Roscoe today! \n\nSee below!*\n\n*Please kindly note: We do not respond to inquiries as we are a very small team! The submission of an application is the first step in our adoption process and is required to schedule a meeting, without exception. All of our dogs are housed in private foster homes.

Caroline thinks she is a lap dog and will crawl right up for some love. She just really wants to be loved. She can be nervous of new people at first, but warms up quickly. Caroline is a total people pleaser and learns quickly. She will sit and come on command, but will need some training  reinforcement in her new home. Caroline walks well on a leash and would love an afternoon stroll with her bestie. She loves to stop and roll in the grass for tummy rubs.  She has good manners and is almost house trained. She just finished nursing her babies, so she is able to really work on herself! \n\n* The adoption fee of $425 includes age-appropriate vaccines, initial de-worming, spay/neuter surgery, microchip and transport fee.\n* The application is the first step in all inquiries and adoptions  \n   https://www.fordogssakerescue.org/application\n* Questions?

He's about a year old, and he's a true rescue dog. Check out that great smile! He's not a big fan of being stuck in a kennel when there are people to meet and things to do on the other side, but once he's out our staff says he's \"awesome.\"  He walks great on his leash. If you already have a dog, please bring your pet over for a meet-and-greet. He needs someone who can handle a large dog, and in return he'll give you large amounts of love and devotion! He's neutered, microchipped and up to date on his shots, and ready to go home with you. Please come on over and meet Winchester!",

Evidently, he was kept in his kennel for 20+ hours a day so learned to use the bathroom in there. Luckily, he's learning house training at the BCC. He has a bad habit of jumping on people, but is also learning good manners at the training program.\nPromethius has been in the program for 4 weeks now and has 4 more weeks to go. He is a fun, playful pup who enjoys people and other dogs. His ideal new home will have plenty of room for him to run and lots of activities to keep him busy.\n12/28/20--Promethius is currently housed and enrolled in the Puppies for Parole Program at the Boonville Correction Center where (s)he will stay for 8 weeks of basic obedience training. (S)He will learn commands such as \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, \u201cheel\u201d, \u201ccome\u201d, etc. (S)He will learn crate and house training. Promethius will be available for adoption while (s) he is in the Program, but will not be released to his/her new adopting family until the end of the 8 weeks when (s)he graduates. The adoption fee for a Puppies for Parole dog is $100. For questions regarding adoptions, call the Marshall Animal Shelter at (660)831-0420",

I like dogs my size and smaller so if you have one like that that would be ok.\n\nIf you would like to meet Mozart send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

Please contact the owner for more information or to adopt: \nPLEASE CONTACT emilia.moncayo@aspca.org\n\nPLEASE CONTACT emilia.moncayo@aspca.org FOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR ADOPTION. NOTE: THIS IS A COURTESY POSTING ONLY! THIS DOG IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH BROTHER WOLF ANIMAL RESCUE\n\nThanks for stopping by, were you stunned by my glamour shot?! My name is Archer and I'm looking for a home of my own. As you may have noticed, I'm a petite fella, but don't let that fool you, I have lots of energy to share with you! I enjoy going on walks and chasing after scents or wild critters that come by, which is why I learned to walk on a harness and sturdy leash. When I'm hanging out at home, I like to play with plush toys, chew on appropriate bones and practice some self-care by taking naps in my crate.\n\nThough I've gained several skills while at the BRC*, I will do best in a structured home where my people can help me continue to become comfortable in the world. I gain a lot of confidence from being with other dogs, so I am looking for a home with another dog, preferably a social and confident one. Once I'm comfortable with you I will keep you entertained with my silly antics - I can't wait!\n\n*Archer is a recent graduate of the ASPCA's Behavioral Rehabilitation Center (BRC) in Weaverville, NC. The BRC is the first and only facility of its kind dedicated to the study and rehabilitation of extremely fearful dogs.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName: Garnet\n\nDOB: 1/20/2018\n\nWeight: 14\n\nAdoption Fee: 375\n\nInfo from my foster Parent below!!\n\nHe is working on potty training. He will have accidents when in his crate and inside still. Also he does not like the snow. I'm not sure he understands the concept of going for walks because he often stops, looks confused, gets EASILY distracted if anyone walks by. He can only walk in the cold for so long until he gives up. His little feetsies get cold.. I doubt he's encountered much snow where he came from. It's going to take a lot of patience and work to get the walks down and learn they're for going potty.\n\nNot too good in the crate as far as being left alone, especially during bed time or when we are away at work. I believe he may have separation anxiety because when I leave for work he will bark loudly. So no shared wall living situations. He needs lots of attention and I don't think he should be left alone for very long. I think he would do best with someone who works from home or a few adults who have staggering shifts so that as soon as one leaves him alone, the next one will be along shortly for the remainder of the time until the primary comes home. Something like that.\n\nHe's okay with my cat. Only snapped at him once I wasn't looking at the time it happened but I believe it was in defense of a chewable bone. Aside from that, the resident cat and Garnet have been tolerating each other nicely. Both curious. I even got them to lay within a foot from each other for nap time . He gets jealous if I pay attention to the cat so I'll try to split the affection equally. He will lay in his bed and act like he doesn't notice, but is staring the entire time with the side eye of me paying attention to another animal. How dare I! Haha\n\nLoves his belly rubs and starting to have fun with all the new toys and treats I bought for him. He's really warming up to me. I can't say how he is around kids as I haven't really been around any. And as for dogs, same thing, but when going for walks, if he sees another one, he's curious, but hasn't barked or sniffed or tried to attack another one, so he seems to be okay with the fact that other dogs exist. :)\n\nSince Garnet is heartworm positive. He will need to be treated at a clinic in St. Cloud.\n\nHeartworm treatment consists of 3 injections. The first injection will be in roughly 30 days after coming into rescue. The the 2nd and 3rd injections happen 30 days after that. When a dog is going through heartworm treatment, they should be on \"restrictions\", meaning a lot of lap time, crate time and always on a leash. Heartworm disease is NOT contagious, it is transported via mosquitos.\n\nHere is a great article explaining what heartworm is and how it's treated: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

            "description": "Hello, meet tiny Greta. She is an honorary Great Pyrenees, disguised as an eight-pound Dachshund. She is four years old and enjoys the company of other dogs, cats, and older kids.\n\nGreta is your typical Dachshund, who will steal your heart away with her sweet personality and make you laugh with her clownish antics and silly looks. She loves to burrow under blankets and snuggle with you. She is house and crate trained.\n\nDue to Greta's tiny size, she would thrive in a home with adults, no small children, dogs her size or smaller and a yard to dig, run and exercise in. If you are looking for a loyal companion, complete an Adoption Application for Greta. She is only available for adoption in OR and WA.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 . (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

            "description": "Poor Leroy was a hunting dog who was abandoned by his owner. As you can see in the 2nd photo, he was severely underweight. He is a 7-8 year old Hound mix. He is a sweet boy in spite of the neglect he has suffered. He's friendly with people & dogs, loves to play and is eager to please you. Won't you give him a chance?\n\nFrom his foster mom-Poor Leroy was found wondering around a remote area of thick woods in NC. He was flea infested, starving and near death. Luckily, he was found and taken to one of our partner rescuers who took him to a vet and nursed him back to health then contacted us. As a result of parasite infestation, Leroy was anemic and developed a heart murmur. Once in NJ Leroy was evaluated by a Veterinary Cardiologist who administrated a echocardiogram and diagnosed the murmur as a result of the anemia. Follow up bloodwork is normal and Leroy got a clean bill of health!!! Leroy is easy, laid back and gets along with dogs, large and small as well as cats. He seeks his human's attention and eager to please. He is playful and well behaved in doors, no crate needed. He is housebroken and has zero food aggression. Leroy is good on a leash and loves car rides. He has interacted with younger children and did well. Leroy would be a great first time dog owner or second dog since he is so easy going.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Leroy, please visit www.ehrdogs.org and ask for him by name, LEROY GIO!",

            "description": "Oreo #7621 is a 10-year-old male Pomeranian mix. He is friendly, sweet and calm. He has a low energy level and likes to chill. His foster mom says he is perfect! Oreo is good with other dogs, cats  and kids. He is both crate and house trained. He responds to the command: sit. He walks well on a leash. He is not very interested in treats. Oreo is picky about the dry food he eats. He prefers canned food. He loves to be held and carried around. He does have arthritis and will need to be on joint supplements. He just had a dental and has a shiny new smile.  He weighs 15 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

Merlin is a typical rambunctious puppy who loves to use his brain...and his mouth! He would do best in a home where his family could manage his enviornment and spend lots of helping him learn manners. Merlin is already a big boy at 5 months old and still has growing to do, so we want to make sure he grows into a well behaved boy. Merlin likes other dogs, but play rough and can be a bit of a bully. He could potentially live with another dog who was very tolerant and had good manners to help teach Merlin the right way! If you are looking for a fun buddy to do lots of training with Merlin might just be your guy!",

He came from a tough situation, so he is a little more timid than most dogs.  However, within an hour of knowing you he warms right up. Then he is a very playful and silly pup.\n\nCosmo is flourishing in his foster home where he loves to play with the smaller dogs and does well with the cat.  He is crate-trained, although he doesn't like it during the day.  At night he is cozy in the crate or his foster parent\u2019s bed, where he loves to put himself under the covers.\n\nCosmo does well on walks, although loud noises and cars do make him cower a bit.  He also gets car sick, but that might change as he grows. \n\n* We do not recommend him for small children as he is still a little skittish.\n\nCosmo still has more training and relaxing to go, but he is doing so well. He needs a forever home that can understand his fears and help him gain his confidence, which we are seeing in him already. \n\nThis dog is currently being fostered as part of Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue. An application is required, along with a home visit and small adoption fee.  Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. **FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED**\n\nPlease visit us on our Facebook page for additional photos, give us a like while you're there! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondsintheruffNC\n\nAll of our dogs are fostered in homes and are INDOOR dogs. We believe all dogs are family members and should be treated as valued members of the household. \n\nAll applicants must be 25 years of age or older.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines for further information on adopting from Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue before submitting an application. www.DITRnc.com.\n\n\n.",

He is an absolute sweetheart.He is dog friendly, people friendly, and kid friendly. I'm unsure how he is with cats since he was not cat tested. Ernesto loves to cuddle and he is curious as well. He is very submissive and has an amazing personality that anyone will fall in love with. He's also unique and special while having only 3 legs. He'll make someone truly happy and will be a wonderful companion to someone. He'd be great in a moderate-active home and he would love to go on brisk walks and hikes. Preferably a house without stairs would be nice for the little guy! He is excited to meet his furever family! He is being fostered in Moses Lake,WA until he finds his perfect home\n\nHe is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed/neutered, comes with 2-6 months of Heartworm preventative, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\nFor any questions of inquires please directly contact violet@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30285/generic\n\n**Application is required to be considered*\n",

Apply today! \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form!

This handsome guy is a 3-year-old Boxer/Pittie mix that weighs around 65 lbs. If you\u2019ve been wishing for a real life Scooby Doo - he\u2019s here!\n\nThis boy is super goofy and has a fun personality that is larger than life! Scooby is social, loves meeting new people, and is super affectionate. When Scooby came into our program, we quickly learned that he is a large dog with puppy tendencies who has little control of his limbs ?. We decided it\u2019d be best to do a board and train with @fullcirclecanine to improve his manners and master his basics! In the week that he\u2019s been there, he has made tremendous progress. He will thrive with an adopter who is dedicated to continuing his training and can provide him the structure he needs. Scooby will benefit from a home with a yard to explore and an adopter who lives an active lifestyle. He\u2019s now ready to find his forever home, and be the Scooby Doo to your Shaggy!",

            "description": "Willie Nelson is an approximate 9 year old pure breed Pomeranian that is an owner surrender from southern Iowa. He came into foster care on July 30, 2020. He was in horrible condition from what we thought was severe neglect for an extended period of time. After getting him to the vet, immediately, it was determined after a thorough exam and testing, that Willie has an autoimmune disorder called Erythema multiforme. This condition triggers his immune system to attack his skin cells and destroy them. He lost all of his fur and several layers of skin over several months before we got his condition stabilized. He is on medication to stabilize his condition but it is something that can not be cured. We hope he will regrow the fur on his back, but only time will tell. Willie was also diagnosed with dry eyes and has ulcers on his eyes. He can see good enough that he can navigate in his surroundings, but he is not comfortable doing any stairs on his own for the most part. His close vision is the worst. He does require a medicated ointment for his eyes twice daily and artificial tears applied a few times a day as well. Willie is house trained but due to his bad eye sight he is carried outside to go potty and carried back in by his foster mom. He will not be able to go on leash walks but he does enjoy sniffing around the yard and laying in the shade when the weather is nice. Due to not knowing what triggered his disease, he is on a special veteranarian diet and will need to stay on that for the rest of his life as well. He will require baths with a special shampoo on occasion and ointment applied to his ears every few days to help remove the scaly thick skin that does not shed off normally. His condition can be painful so a gentle touch is required when touching and picking him up. He does well with dogs as long as they leave him alone. He would be best with other older dogs or no dogs in the home. He has no interaction with the cats in his foster home. Due to his condition and the pain he can experience some times, he needs a home with children 13 and above or no children. Willie is very affectionate and loves to be held and petted. He spends most of his time lounging on the couch on his 'special Prince pillow' as his foster mom affectionately calls his soft and cozy pillow. His resilience is amazing and the fact that he is such a loving, sweet, and happy boy is testament to just how special this boy is. The cost associated with Willie's continued care is about $100 per month right now but it could go up as he ages. His adopter will need to work closely with their veteranarian to keep Willie's conditions stable and be willing to put in the time to maintain his strict personal care every day.\n\nAdoption fee is $150 (senior rate) which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.\n\nIf you would like to meet Willie Nelson, please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application",

He enjoys long walks and has good leash manners. \nHe is up to date on shots, neutered and microchipped.\n\nIf you feel you would be a good fit for Mocha please send a completed application to vicki@nokillarc.org.

I mean, look at that face! She is around 2 years old and weighs around 35-40 pounds. Cora loves to play with her foster dog brothers. She plays hard and naps harder. Cora isn't a huge fan of the crate but won't fight you to get in it. We are working on potty training but she has had very few accidents in the house, knows what \"let's go outside\" means, and is doing so well. Cora loves to snuggle with her human fosters and wants to be by one of their sides at all times. All in all, Cora would be perfect in any home but would prefer a family with an active lifestyle and a canine sibling for her to play with.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

He was surrendered because his previous owner didn't have time for him. Poor Hippo. He really needs a family willing to spend time training him. An active family would be best because he is a high energy boy who is strong on the lead and needs exercise. We are unsure how he is with kids, cats and other dogs.

We could not believe no one came to claim this special pup, but we were glad to give him the second chance he deserves! Chico is a typical happy retriever boy where no one is a stranger and he loves everyone he meets, both two and four legged! He loves attention and is very playful and silly. Chico seems to have been well socialized and has done great meeting other dogs. He walks well on a leash and is eager to learn and please his people. Chico would do well in many types of families as long as there is lots of playtime, love and belly scratches! Please help us find Chico the forever home he's searching for! \n\nInterested in adopting?

This handsome boy walks well on a leash and will even smile up at you as he shows you his silly side by walking through your legs!

            "description": "Brandy is an 11 month old spayed female lab/boxer mix who weighs 52 lbs. Brandy and her brother, Brownie, found themselves at risk at a high kill shelter after their elderly owner could no longer give them the attention and exercise they deserve. We were glad to be able to step up to offer Brownie and Brandy a safe place to go, and have promised them only the best from here on out! Brandy is a sweet and social girl who enjoys getting lots of love and attention! She isn't as confident as her brother and she seems happiest when she has Brownie or another pup around. Brandy enjoys playing with other dogs and gets along well with everyone she meets. Brandy walks well on a leash and seems eager to learn and please. She would make a great running or walking buddy and promises to be a wonderful adventure buddy for her new family. We can't wait for Brandy to find a family who will give her the spoiled life she deserves! Could that be yours?\n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Hi, I'm Stella!\n\nDo you like other dogs? I do not seem to enjoy the company of other dogs. I would likely do best as the only dog in the home. \n\nWhat do you think about cats? I have an unknown history with cats. \n\nSo how do you feel about kids? I would do best with older kids that can give me my space when needed. \n\nWhat's your energy level like? I have a medium to high energy level.\n\nWhat is it that staff and volunteers love about you? I am a super sweet girl who enjoys walks and attention!\n\nIs there anything else we should know about you? I am 3 yrs old and I weigh between 55-60 pounds. I do have a medical release the staff will discuss with you.\n\nI came into the shelter as a transfer and the above information is all recommendations based on my previous history and the behavior seen at the shelter. Expect to learn more about me after adoption.\nIt is unknown how this animal will do in their new home as all animals can be different with each person. It is important to take this into consideration when thinking about adopting and making sure you are prepared to work with any potential medical or behavior issues that occur after adoption.\n\nMy adoption fee includes my spay/neuter, current vaccinations, permanent microchip identification, certificate for a free veterinary exam, post-adoption support and more!\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! If you think we would be a good match call and ask about me! I'm looking for my forever home and it could be with you!\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION: If you live in the city of Eugene or in Lane County you will be purchasing a dog license in addition to the adoption fee. You will get to choose between a one year, two year, or three year license. \nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503. See all of the pets at this shelter by visiting www.green-hill.org.",

I love running in the yard, and barking at the huge flocks of geese that hang out near the fence. I can be kind of jumpy, so I'll need help learning some manners, and I haven't entirely figured out the leash, but I'm working on it!

He quickly became friends with everybody in the area and stayed, on his own, for about two years. Recently, Bo made his way to the local Aninmal Services facility where no one came forward to reclaim him. Despite his freewheeling history, he walks great on a leash, has no body handling issues, and happily greets everyone he meets. Bo is also good friends with MJ, from their former homes. Both dogs were happily reunited and will continue to play together while here! If you are interested in meeting Bo, please complete the adoption application through www.orhspets.org. We look forward to hearing from you!",

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nSweet Nala is a 3-4 year-old Boxer/Mountain Cur mix female with perhaps a little Pittie in her family tree who has a very kind and gentle disposition. She found herself homeless at an overcrowded rural county dog shelter and after being in the shelter for several weeks, made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she could relax in a foster home while searching for a permanent new home. While we don't have any history on this lovely girl, she has been the perfect houseguest in her foster home since arriving here with us. Nala has enjoyed meeting new people and has gotten along well with every dog she's met since her arrival here. She has had several litters of pups in the past but her days as a mom are now over as Nala is spayed and ready to live her life as someone's pampered pup for a change. Nala was very stoic in front of the camera but she always greets her foster mom with a big smile and whole body wag. She walks quite well on the leash, knows the sit command, and takes treats very gently. Nala can get quite playful at times now that her hard days are behind her. She may jump up seeking attention from her human friends when she's excited but is very responsive to training. Nala has had excellent crate manners in her foster home and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. She might enjoy having a canine buddy in her home but would likiely also be fine as the only dog in the home provided her family has plenty of time to shower her with lots of love and attention. We can't wait to see this sweetheart settle into her very own home. Nala weighs about 65 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Nala. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Nala and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

He knows how to indicate to the other dog when he needs a time out and will go into his crate for that. He sleeps quietly through the night and loves the smallest dog bed that is at his foster home (despite larger beds being available) and will curl himself up into a contented ball. He doesnt seem to know commands yet, so his Foster Family is working on 'sit' as a first step. He walks nicely on the leash when it's quiet out (loud noises scare him, but he recovers quickly), he does require dedicated leash training which we're working on. He's a hound and can be determined to stay on the scent, so someone who can help him learn leash etiquette would do great with him! Abraham is still learning the ins and outs of the house, like which is a toy and which is a shoe, and just which toy he wants to chew! He'd love someone that's patient with him and can bring him out of his shell more, he's warmed in his foster home and would love to melt your heart!",

            "description": "ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS\nFenced yard\nCanine sibling\n\nMy name is Markie. I was found running the streets and no one ever came looking for me so I am in the market for a new home. I am about 4 years old and weigh in at 14lbs. I am a super fun little dude and like to be on the go but I am also a snuggle bug my foster mom says. I love going for walks and hanging out playing in the yard. I would do best with a dog sibling that likes to play also. I am fine with kids but probably a little older would be best. I am fine with cats but if they run I will chase them. They run because they want to play, right?? I am a little shy at first but that passes quickly. I am crate trained and still working on be housebroken. I came with a nasty infection that has since been cleared up but during the time I had it I couldn't hold it and now I have to be reminded where I am supposed to use the bathroom. \n\nIf you would like to meet Markie send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back to you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

Niihau, currently, lives in her foster home with two other dogs. She\u2019s working hard on her potty training and sleeps in her crate at night. She also loves children of all ages. She has been spayed it is up-to-date on her shots. If you would like to meet this amazing girl please submit your application.\n\nI will come with the works (Neutered/Spayed, up to date on everything, micro chipped, fecal, heartworm tested if age appropriate, heartworm, flea and tick preventative, one month insurance and free vet visit).  What more could a new family ask for?  COVID 19 restrictions:  If I have not been altered by adoption I will have to return to my vet for my procedure.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and thinking about adoption, please visit our website http//www.wagginghearts.org and submit an adoption application. Include the name(s) of the animal(s) you are interested in the subject line of the email. Due to the high volume of applications we receive we are only able to process fully completed applications. We do not reply to inquiries. Since we are a foster based rescue we are unable to set up meet and greets until a completed application is on file and has been approved. \n\nWagging Hearts is a 100% foster-based, non-profit rescue organization. \n\nOur mission is to rescue abandoned, neglected, and stray companion animals. Please visit http//www.wagginghearts.org if you would like to adopt and provide a forever home to one in need.",

We are in the process of having him neutered.\n\nLong story short... I'm from India! When I was three months old, I was found by locals laying in the middle of the road with my throat cut open. I don't really like to think about that anymore though, because ever since I was rescued, I've been living the life! The wonderful people in India took care of me until I was fully healed and ready to fly to New York. Can you believe it?! Me, a little puppy from India, traveling all the way around the world to find my perfect forever family in New York!\n\nMy foster mom in Hudson, New York says I'm a happy-go-lucky, very energetic and super sweet puppy with lots of love to give. I'm looking for an active family who is willing to train me and give me lots of exercise. Even though I'm still young, I'll always be high energy, so a big fenced-in yard and lots of walks/runs/hikes is what I'd love. I'm great with other dogs who also want to play all day long. I'm currently being fostered with three dogs and a cat. My foster family has worked on crate training me, which I'm doing well with, and I'm already housebroken. Another thing I love-- my family. I like to be around them all day, but because I'm high energy (but not aggressive), I'd do best with kids 10 years or older. I cannot wait to meet you!\n\nMy ideal family:\n-A very active family who likes to go for walks/runs/hikes/to the dog park\n-Big, fenced-in yard\n-Another young dog in the house who likes to play a lot\n-A family who is firm with training and willing to work with Benny\n-A family member who works from home or is home a lot\n\nMeet and greet/adoption will take place in Hudson, New York. If you are interested in adopting Benny, please fill out our application here: http://www.paws4survival.com/dog-application. Do not directly reply on petfinder. Post will be updated when Benny is adopted.",

            "description": "This breathtaking five-year-old, male Siberian husky, \u201cHappo,\u201d weighs 64 pounds, loves treats, and can\u2019t resist a belly rub. We believe he was an outside dog being used as a breed dog, before he was surrendered to the animal shelter. He bonded quickly with his handler, whose company he prefers over that of other dogs. He\u2019s a little shy at first,  but loves the attention he is now getting. Happo can take a few minutes to warm up to strangers, but offering him a few treats speeds up his interest in new people. He still prefers to be outside, probably due to his super dense fluffy coat. He tolerates his crate and kennel but they are definitely not his favorite. He LOVES walks with his handler, which also fulfills the typical Husky need for exercise. Happo enjoys being mentally and physically stimulated, learning new tricks, and exploring new places. He is initially excited when on the leash, but once in a steady rhythm with his handler, he quickly matches stride. Hippo needs an experienced guardia, in a home without other animals/livestock, as he has a decent pray drive. He can live with other dogs, preferably submissive/passive females or young pups, and after more socialization we believe he\u2019ll do well with most other dogs. Happo is a lovely fellow, who must find his FOREVER home. To get more information on a Pups On Parole dog, please contact a representative of the Lassen Humane Society at 530 251-7247 or e-mail ilovepopdogs@yahoo.com.  The Pups On Parole Program started in June of 2007 to help give homeless dogs a second chance at finding an adoptive family.  All dogs in the program spent time in our local county shelter, surrendered by their owners or picked up as strays and waiting for their owners to redeem them or to be adopted by new families.   The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.  To meet any of the Pups On Parole dogs, arrangements must be made in advance.",

I've been to a vet and have been all fixed up and I'm now ready to find my forever home.  I'm going to be a big, smart boy when I grow up. I'm still young, estimated DOB 11/9/2020 and probably have some Black Mouth Cur in my ancestry. I'm learning so much now that I'm in a home with other dogs and I love the whole family. I'm just a puppy and can get into a lot of trouble so you'll need to be willing to give me lots of gentle guidance, so I can learn all those big dog things, like how to behave in a house, what a crate is for, how to walk on a leash without pulling, and all those verbal commands every dog should know. I may even treat people like I treat my sibling with rough play or decide that new pair of shoes or a table leg would make a great chew toy, so a lot of appropriate toys should be in my future. The good news is that with the right training and LOTS of love, I'll be the best addition to your family ever and your best bud. If you are interested in me, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.  \n\nIf you are interested in me, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.\n\nAdopter for this dog must reside in the immediate Houston/Galveston area and be at least 25 years old.  A home visit may be required prior to this dog going to any home. The adoption fee for a dog is $190 (or $245 for puppies) which includes State of Texas sales tax.

He not only had swimmers syndrome he also has some pretty severe out turned hips & knees that make it difficult for him to get around. \nLeo needs daily physical therapy to keep his muscles loose and help him get around, he\u2019s oh so cute but we really want people to try to look beyond that and understand this boy will probably always be special needs. \n\nHe needs a non slippery surface in the home, his out turned hips and knees could be an orthopedic issue as he gets older so that needs to also be kept in mind and could be costly. \n\nHe\u2019s the sweetest guy that makes the funniest noises, he loves to play with playful dogs and snuggle with his favorite human. \n\nWe are looking for a breed experienced home for him, and he is 7 months old!\n\nPlease visit our website and fill out an application to be considered. \nwww.animalhelpalliance.org \n\nYou will not be contacted if you don\u2019t not \n1 Have an approved application on file. \n2 Don\u2019t fill out an application. \n",

I have a lot of energy and I really like to smother my people with love and affection, it seems that all my other homes didn't have enough time to teach me how to be a good boy so I keep getting moved from house to house. The people at Mended Souls say I am a really good boy but I need a kid free home and I take a long time to warm up to other dogs, but I can! They also think I would do best with a high energy person that is home a lot or likes to take me with them. I get lonely when you leave so I cry and bark, but i am working on that I promise. I am three years old and I am just learning how to be a dog so please be patient with me. \n\nI am told I am way to curious about cats and so we agreed I would live somewhere that kitties do not. \n\nThanks for listening, please share my story! \n\nXoXo Buddy ?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Buddy please call \n  207-319-5065",

But, she has a sturdy figure (weighs 17 lbs) , I would say resembles a dachshund, but not as long in length, with legs more on the Chi side (long).  Missy\u2019s first home was so wonderful for 10 years, but her owner passed away and her veterinary promised her mom that she would make sure Missy was well taken care of and help find her a second home to live her golden years.  I am blessed to get to foster this lovely dog.  She is so sweet, low-maintenance, smart, loving, I could just go on and on with all of her greatness.  She is awesome with other dogs, great with cats.  Missy may be 10 years old, but she is fun, loves to run around backyard and play.  She loves her toys and of course, her treats.  She is house trained, leash trained, enjoys car rides. Missy has actually never had any flaws while being with me, she is easy going, and just fit right in my household.  She shares her food with others, no quarrels, no aggression.  Missy loves to cuddle, she also enjoys just lounging around in her dog bed as well taking life on day at time and enjoying every minute.  She has no health concerns at this time and her physical was great.  She has always been well-cared for and deserves to live her golden years as a spoiled companion.\n\nIf interested in adopting Missy, please complete our application at www.secondchanceresq.com\n\n\n-----------PLEASE READ----------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest (with stops in Seattle, WA; Portland; OR) through a partnership with Project Freedom Ride.

And if there's room for a little tootsie roll dog named Tootsie, in your life, if so then I am just the loving, cuddly playful dog for you and your family.  How I came to be here at the rescue: my human passed, and their friend contacted them, and they welcomed me with open arms. I am ready for my new human which would be YOU! Yes you, to take me home and spoil me, FYI I can give her all the looks and she still will not give me people food, that look usually does the trick...my rescue mom just says \"No Ma'am\" I am 10 years young totally house broken and come with a few tricks. How about we met and get to know each other I guarantee lots of kisses and wagging tails! I am spayed, Up to date of vaccinations and HW and Flea Prevention.  No underlying medical conditions to speak of.  Please apply for Tootsie at sger.petfinder.com",

As a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.

He is a little shy but it's likely due to a change in circumstances for him as he was with a family, but they moved and could not take him.  We'll provide more info as we get to know him.  \n\nBlitz is neutered, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. His adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nBlitz is sponsored by one of his transporters, Carol Spring. Thank you! \n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

That you came on here looking for ME? Truly? You saw my picture, and said I was a beautiful, old girl in Waynesville, GA, who needed someone JUST LIKE THEM to be totally happy for the rest of her life? Well, that is amazing! I guess that means we are going to be best friends FOREVER! And to think it all started when you looked into my eyes. Let me just explain how I came to be here at the rescue, my long time human and a friend of hers contacted them which they took me in.  It is time for me to find YOU! My forever family.  Do not let the little grey around my muzzle fool you.  I am 10 years young and love to play love children and other furry family members. I am totally house broken, quiet and would love to have YOU! as my new family. I am spayed, Up to date of vaccinations and HW and Flea Prevention.  No underlying medical conditions to speak of.

He currently weighs around 50 lbs. but is quite thin and probably has a bit of growing to do yet.  Finley just seems to be an all around nice dog. \n\nFinley is neutered, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. His adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nFinley is currently sponsored by: Roberta Gray Debra Beatty, Arlene DeJesus, Thomas and Elizabeth Tarpley, Amy Schmidt, Bob and Karen Davis, Jerry and Marilyn Bertges in memory of Mandy, Bob and Trudy Sensel, and Bob and Lorna Barrie.  Finley is also sponsored by Meg Thering in memory of \"Bella\" Sarek Diate. Thank you everyone!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

            "description": "This is Rooney. He is an absolutely adorable freckle-faced 5-year-old, 47 lb. Aussie mix ready to bust out of the kennel. He was surrendered to us because he growled at the new baby in the home. \n\nRooney reminds me of the movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" because all he does is growl. He growls when he's happy, he growls when he's sad. He growls to growl.  He loves to growl! I feel like there should be a poem in here somewhere.   Growling is his jam, but he's not aggressive! Kinda like me :) You MUST watch the video attached to truly understand.\n\nHe cat tested fine at the kennel, and he would be great as an only dog.  Any dogs in the home need to understand he will growl at them even when he's having fun and is playing. He also plays rough.  We are saying no kids because of his previous situation.  12 and up only, please.  Fenced yard not required if you commit to leash walking.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ then email Debbie@BigFluffyDogs.com.\n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Athena! I am approximately 2 years old. I came to SparKY after I was found with a broken back on the side of the road in April 2020. No one claimed me so SparKY stepped in to help me get better, I had a long recovery as my back took several months to mend. I am able to move my hind legs but unfortunately, I am no longer able to support my weight on them due to the nerve damage in my spine. I have a doggie wheelchair to help me walk when I go outside or in the house. I also have drag bags which I use inside so as I don\u2019t get carpet burn on legs, my foster mom says I am the fastest two-legged dog you will meet. I am very much a beagle, I love to smell things when I am outside and will follow my nose if you allow me. I know the song of my people and have a very soulful beagle voice. I wear diapers as I leak urine a little. My foster mom will express my bladder so that I stay drier but it is not necessary for me to have it done as I can urinate when I go outside or if you hold me over a toilet or a pee pad. I love yard time outside with my fellow doggie housemates. I require a fenced in yard or someone to stay with me outside because I like to follow my nose wherever the smells take me. I will come with my cart, drag bags, and cloth diapers. I have a very soulful expression. I love to have my head patted and my neck rubbed. I am looking for my fur-ever home, will you please adopt me? I promise to be a good girl. \nAthena is up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, microchipped and spayed.  If you are interested in a Sparky pet , please go to www.sparkyrescue. com/adopting and fill out an application \n",

Dusty is about 15 lbs currently and expected to be in the large size range when full grown. He\u2019s good with other dogs and cats. He LOVES kids and truly brightens up when one comes around. Dusty is a very active boy and would do best in an active home. He\u2019s working on house and kennel training as well as his puppy manners. \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

I was surrendered to a local shelter by my owner who said I could be snappy with their child and did not like being in a crate so the rescue will look for an all adult home for my next home. However, the foster home has had NO issues with me going in a crate as long as you do not shove me, just ask me to go in and off I go. I have not be tested with kids but I have been tested with all kinds of folks and I am a bit guarded but only with men but very friendly to woman. I am good with other dogs and do not know what to make of the meow here. I am crate trained and working on my house manners. I am ready for the right home, if you would like to be considered to adopt me, please remember that the first step in adoption with this nice rescue is to fill out an application on the website www.floprva.org - please do not send emails that just slows down the process. Only an application will work~ also, you will only be contacted if you are the lucky selected home. \nLove, JoJo xo",

Maggie is shy but has been very sweet with all of the volunteers.  More info soon.  \n\nMaggie is spayed, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nMaggie is sponsored by: Chelsea Barber, Elaine Tschari, Paula E. Stern, Lisa and Jason Weaver and Matthew Fowler. She is also sponsored by Steve and Diane Mogavero, Don and Joanne Pochopin m John and Susan Harrell, Tom and Betsy White and Wanda Hardy. Thank you everyone!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.

He is a country boy at heart - he also loves to ride on tractors and gators! :) He likes to chase the planes that go by in his yard and try and hunt the mice in his barn. He also loves toys and cuddling. He is such a sweet boy that just wants to be with his people. He is currently living with a cat and rabbit! Rowdy has also been around horses, sheep and goats his whole life. He is not a fan of other dogs because he can get anxious, so he would do best as the only dog in the home.\n\nRowdy is also crate trained and loves his crate, it is his safe place. He has had professional training so knows all of his commands and likes to have his human guide him.\n\nThis handsome boy is a cuddle bug that would love nothing more than to lay in bed with you all day and that deserves a quiet, safe place to relax and be loved on. If you think this could be you please fill out an application! Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

He thinks he's a small lapdog and loves to snuggle with his human. He loves car rides and going anywhere he can be near his human.\n\nMidnight is great with his female furry foster sisters and with the older children in the home. He would not be good with another territorial male or cats. Nor should he be in a home with small children just because of his size - he may get excited and accidently knock them down or step on them. Despite his large size, Midnight loves to play and has a lot of energy.\n\nMidnight is housebroken and crate trained. He's very well behaved in the house and is not a trouble maker at all. His adoption fee is $125. For more information, please call 662-342-9448; email us via info@desotoanimalrescue.org or submit a pre-adoption application here: http://desotoanimalrescue.org/dog-adoption-application.html\n\n1/28/21 4:10 PM",

Weighing in at only 8 pounds, Bandit needs a home that is going to help him grow big and strong like the dog he already thinks he is while at the same time he needs a family that will be able to keep up with his endless energy. Bandit would do best in a home with no smaller children as he is little and quick and could easily be tripped over. Bandit loves to give kisses and get attention, when he stops long enough to get them and when it is time for him to take a break he is ready and willing to find a lap to climb in to. Bandit's adoption fee is $200. which will cover vaccinations, microchipping, neutering, heartworm and tick testing as well as he will be started on a heartworm preventative. Bandit is scheduled to be neutered on February 16th, and would be placed as a foster to adopt until his neuter surgery occurs. If you are interested in Bandit please email jrein@carrollcountymd.gov to request an adoption application which has to be filled out first.",

Her favorite thing to do with volunteers is cuddling on the couch while watching Netflix on their phones. She likes dramas the best.

I haven't had a lot of socialization but I am hoping to find an owner who will help me overcome my fears.

He does have some ongoing health issues which makes him a hospice adoption. He gets along with other dogs as long as they aren't in his face trying to boss him around. Cliff is deaf and will require someone with a fenced in yard. He will also need a quiet home without young children. For more information on Cliff you can call or text 765-969-4782.

            "description": "Joey and Katie came to the Sanctuary together and have always been together. Joey takes all of his cues from her. He is a timid boy which takes some time to get to know. Once he loves you he will follow you anywhere, as long as Katie does too. After working with him a couple of months we are able to walk him with the pack of dogs at the Sanctuary but he still needs vigilant supervision with them. He is good with Katie but doesn't seem to know how to interact with the others and can become agitated with them. Joey and Katie seem to have had little socialization outside of their own yard. A positive reinforcement trainer would be great to have on hand when adopting them. They do need adopted as a set currently. We were hoping to work on Joeys socialization skills enough that they could be separated but it hasn't worked out as so. Katie would do fine but we fear Joey would fall apart. They are both large teddy bear dogs and would do well in a large fenced area. They like to come in but as long as they don't get too hot or wet they like hanging out outside. If your interested in adopting Joey and Katie it will take multiple visits before they are comfortable with you enough to go home. To adopt them please go to www.libertyacresunited.com and submit your application. Their adoption fee together is $150. For more information you can call or text 765-969-4782",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nHandsome PRANCER is a 1.5 year old 55 lb. mixed breed boy looking for a furever home. He's a playful young dog who loves to fetch and chase squirrels. He also loves to cuddle and thinks 55 lbs. is the perfect size for a lapdog. Prancer has had basic training -- he knows shake, sit and stay. He looooves kids but needs a home that's on the quieter side because meeting new people makes him very anxious. He's fine with family activity, but not well suited to a home where lots of strangers are stopping by. Prancer would be happiest in a home with another dog who's confident and playful. He needs a physically fenced yard where he can fetch and fetch and fetch. Prancer is fully housebroken and crate trained. We aren't sure what his breed mix is, he's likely a mix of multiple breeds, but we believe he's part Labrador retriever, maybe some American Staffordshire terrier and who knows what else. If you'd like to meet this big handsome lovebug, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at dreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

The nice folks at RDR will update my profile when they learn more about me. I can't wait to share all the love I've got to give!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nColin has tested positive for heartworms. Treatment will be paid for by RDR once they are adopted and settled in their home. Please note that this will require exercise restriction for 60 days and 2 visits to an RDR approved vet for treatment. For more information on heartworms click here:\nhttps://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

I\u2019m a very happy girl with a lot love (& kisses) to give! I\u2019m a very smart girl who has already mastered sit and I\u2019m working on some more basic commands. While I was at the vet getting my shots and snips, I learned that I am heartworm positive. They told me no worries, the rescue will take care of me and I will be 100% healthy in just a few months. The best news is that I don't have to wait to be adopted - I can go home with my meds and just need a few more appointments at one of the rescue's partnered vets!\nI love all people, I get along great with the smaller human in my foster home and I do awesome with other dogs! I\u2019m working on going potty outside and I do well in my crate at night.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about or meet Piper, please fill out an adoption application on our website at k9s4u.org under adopt a pet, then contact Autumn @ 517-861-0619 once application is completed.\n#K9s4uPiper\n",

I am still learning my crate training, and am doing well with it. I like to go for walks where I get to see all kinds of new things in my new environment. I like to play with toys, but sometimes I like to chew them up so I get hard toys only. I love when it is time to play and learn with you. Getting pets and cuddle time is my favorite part of the day. I pick a comfy spot next to you and take a nap while I get that special attention. Come on in and meet me today.",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nIf you love dog kisses, Kismet is your girl! This very friendly and affectionate 1 year-old Black Mouth Cur/Catahoula mix spayed female came to us as a stray from an overcrowded county dog shelter. When she wasn't claimed, she made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she could enjoy life in a foster home while searching for the perfect new home. While we don't have any history on her pre-shelter life, we have found Kismet to be a friend to everyone-human and canine alike. She even met the resident kitty at the vet clinic with a wagging tail and friendly demeanor but given that she's still very puppyish, she might chase kitties for fun. Kismet loves to play but can be a little mouthy when playing with her human friends. She would do well having a playful canine buddy in her new home to roughhouse with. Kismet is very food-motivated and seems to respond to the sit command so should be a quick study in obedience work. She has had excellent crate manners in her foster home and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. Kismet gets very excited going for a walk so does pull some on the leash. She would do well with a harness as she works on her leash manners. If you're looking for an active and energetic canine buddy, Kismet would love to meet youu. Kismet weighs about 47 pounds and her adoption fee is $350. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Kismet. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Kismet and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

She and Haru were among the 1,000 dogs rescued from the Aerinwon shelter after the Korean government shut it down for neglect and corruption. Despite losing her eye due to cataracts at a very young age, she is thriving with her foster family, and her spunky and sweet personality is developing more by the day! She\u2019s getting straight A\u2019s for her crate training, house breaking, and appetite.  While she can get spooked by the loud noises of NYC, she walks very well on her leash, and is a polite little lady with other canine (and human) passerby\u2019s.  Has this one-eyed lady melted your heart yet? Apply to adopt Aeyoung!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nOur adoption radius is now within 30 miles of the following locations:  NYC, Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley, DC, Baltimore, MD, and Western & Eastern CT. You must be able to pick up the dog at our office in Astoria, Queens (no exceptions). You must wear a mask and practice safe social distancing when traveling and picking up the dog.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\n\nPlease check our Adopt page (www.koreank9rescue.org/adopt) and our Adoption FAQ (www.koreank9rescue.org/adoption-faq) to learn more! These pages include our requirements, adoption fees, adoption procedures, currently adoptable dogs, answers to frequently asked questions, and the link to our online adoption application!\n\n\nNOT READY TO ADOPT BUT LOVE OUR DOGS?\n\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) dog rescue, we rely on donations to continue saving these precious dogs.

This lovely 8 year old lab mix is a happy go lucky girl who will definitely melt your heart.\n\nPrissy came to us from West Virginia after she was discarded for a younger dog. How awful\n\n. But, that was Prissy's best day. This beautiful girl is fully housetrained, and there is no need to crate her because she is perfectly behaved when left alone. Prissy is UTD on all of her vaccines and is spayed and microchipped as well.\n\nPrissy loves to follow her people so she can get all of the cuddles. She is wonderful with children (she absolutely adores her human foster sister) and is ok with another calm dog. Prissy is great on a leash and will take long walks with you or a nice jog. Prissy is not a huge fan of toys, and we think she just does not know what to do with them. A warm bed or spot on the sofa suits her just fine. Prissy does not know she is 8 years old, so she can keep up with an active family.\n\nTo be considered to adopt Prissy, please submit our Dog/Puppy Adoption Application as this is the FIRST step in our process:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/203643479832159\n\nNOTE: we are a foster-based rescue in Southeastern Pennsylvania which means we don't have a physical location (our sanctuary is for our farm animals only). We only set up meets for approved applicants and you must be located within 2 hours of Philadelphia.",

He is all Goober and a lot of wiggle.   Odie gets along well with large and small dogs, and ideally would love a place where he could romp and play.   He is a happy smiley boy with energy and his happy shows with his tail wag.\n\nAt the time you are seeing this post, Odie is still available for adoption. But please know that we may be working on multiple applications already, and any one of them could be approved at any time. Please READ THIS ENTIRE DESCRIPTION and complete an adoption application, if you are interested in any of our animals. Application at www.greendogsunleashed.org   If you send an inquiry to ask if the dog is still available, or just tell us you are interested, your inquiry will not be answered. FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. We can do NOTHING without that. No, we cannot tell you if he would be a match for your family without seeing an application.  PLEASE KEEP READING for info.\n\n*/*/* PLEASE NOTE:  The first communication you will receive after completing an application will be an email response, which will have instructions on how to proceed. Please check your inbox AND spam folders for the next 48 hours, for this email. We will not begin processing an application without the information requested in that email. */*/*\n\nWe are happy to consider applicants from out of state on most dogs. Please read the description to see if this dog is an exception.  If the applicant is approved to adopt, they MUST be willing to come to our location in Troy, VA, for a meet and greet. If all parties agree that the pup and family are a good fit,  they would take the pup home at that time.\n\nFor more information about our mission and for an APPLICATION for adoption, please go to www.greendogsunleashed.com.\n\nGDU does ask a minimum adoption fee of $300.00. This does not even come close to covering all expenses created by animals while in rescue. We are funded solely by the angels and volunteers willing to donate time and finances. This minimum fee includes DAPP, rabies if age appropriate,, heartworm test and preventative, if age appropriate, and flea and tick treatment, as well as neutering or spaying, if the animal is medically sound to undergo surgery.  In an attempt to avoid tummy upset from a sudden change of food, the foster family may include a small, transitional bag of the food the dog/puppy has been eating. And if the dog/puppy has grown attached to a special item (like a toy or blanket), they may send that along, as well.\n\n*/*/*  Young puppies will receive age-appropriate vaccines, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters may be required to provide additional puppy boosters and at 16 weeks of age, a rabies vaccine. Future annual vaccines, testing and monthly heartworm preventative are REQUIRED, and will be the financial responsibility of the adopter.",

If you would like to meet him please visit him there!\n\nCaptain is ready to set sail with his new family! This sweet guy may take a little time to feel fully confident and comfortable in his new home, but would love to find someone who is ready to give him the time and love to do so! He can be a little nervous when he goes to the doctor (who isn't!) so he would love if his new family helped him feel safer and more relaxed with some fun and positive training!\n\nWe are open to the public on a first come, first serve basis and are limiting our capacity to 50% in order to keep both our staff and community safe during this pandemic. HSP continues to provide an essential service to the community by intaking pets in need and finding adoptive homes. In order to continue operations, we must reduce the potential spread of the virus by taking extra precautions. We ask that all visitors entering HSP facilities wear appropriate face or mask coverings while maintaining at least a 6 foot social distance.\n\nFor more information on any of our Adoptable Pets, please visit our live website www.humanepinellas.org.  If you have questions on specific animals, please call 727-797-7722.  Our website is live so if an animal appears on the website, it is currently at the shelter.  However, the website does not reflect  adoptions in process or holds which have been placed for meet and greets on animals.  We suggest if you are coming to meet just one animal, please call first.",

            "description": "Saint Nick ACCT-A-21017\nIntake: Owner Surrender\nSex: Male\nAge: 6 years\nAltered: No\n\n**$50 in Pledges**\n\nMedical Observations: \n12/22 (Intake Exam) -- Old wounds on all four legs healed; possible burn (healed) on front left ankle. \n\nBehavioral Observations: \n1/27 (Per Volunteer) -- Saint Nick is a ball of energy. But he's definitely a lover . \nWhen he sees me he knows he's going for a run and he's really happy . \nHe's a big sprinter for about a minute but then settles into a nice 10 min a mile pace. \nI like to joke that he's a really good trainer as when he goes for a poop , he likes to go upside down against a tree like a human does against a wall upside down doing shoulder presses. \nHe also trains my core really well because when he takes a potty break he really spins his back legs fast, kicking dirt, but he doesn't stop his legs spinning, then start running. He goes into his back leg spinning and then without stopping, starts his front legs so he's at tip top speed in less than a second, ( think the roadrunner) so I have to really hold my core really firm when he starts , every time he takes a potty break.\nAfter that 5 sec burst of speed , he does slow down to a nice medium pace .\nHe really forms a strong bond with someone he's met a couple of times and is a really loving dog. \nHaven't tried any dog meets yet though. \nHe definitely needs a home with an active person or a big yard, but he's a really really loving dog who makes my day when he sees me and knows he's about to run through the cemetery.\n1/27 (Per Volunteer)-- He was calm in kennel and easy to leash. Once leashed and I opened the door to his kennel fully, he launched out like he was a race horse and pulled towards the door. He is VERY housetrained. He peed and pooped multiple times outside. When we got outside he saw another volunteer, who is his favorite running buddy. The other volunteer told me that Saint Nick is a star runner. We ran multiple laps in the parking lot. He is a great runner. Fast and straight, but we match pace and listen to cues for direction or slowdown. He checked in with me frequently. We then went into the big run. He enjoyed sniffs and would sit for treats. I had not attempted handling yet. He saw the other volunteer again through the fence and got very excited. It's clear he has an affection for him. He climbed up on the bench to get close to the other volunteer. After a few minutes he seemed to get very excitable and got the zoomies. He jumped up at me and launched back having put his front paws to my body. I decided it was best to end our time in the run, picked up his leash and we left the run. We did a few more laps in the parking lot and then proceeded to return to the building. On our way in he again spotted the other volunteer and stopped, waiting to see the other volunteer. So the other volunteer walked with us back into the building. He went into his kennel without issue\n1/15 (Per Staff) -- Kennel Presentation: Easy to leash/social\nLeash Skills: Pulls Strongly On Leash\nHandleability: Aroused/Unable to handle - Currently not interested in being handled.

If so, please get your application in to Green Dogs Unleashed ASAP before Kevin B.  does!! I\u2019ve already overheard him talking to Bailey....\u201cgo work your magic on your foster mom\u201d ?\nBailey is 6 years old, deaf, neutered, house and crate trained and up to date on all vaccines. Loves car rides, belly rubs, Frisbees, tennis balls and hanging out on the couch in front of the TV. Is great with dogs of all sizes and cats. You will need to continue with his diet and exercise plan so he can get to his ideal weight :)\u201d\n\nAt the time you are seeing this post, Bailey is still available for adoption. But please know that we may be working on multiple applications already, and any one of them could be approved at any time. Please READ THIS ENTIRE DESCRIPTION and complete an adoption application, if you are interested in any of our animals. Application at www.greendogsunleashed.org   If you send an inquiry to ask if the dog is still available, or just tell us you are interested, your inquiry will not be answered. FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. We can do NOTHING without that. No, we cannot tell you if he would be a match for your family without seeing an application.  PLEASE KEEP READING for info.\n\n*/*/* PLEASE NOTE:  The first communication you will receive after completing an application will be an email response, which will have instructions on how to proceed. Please check your inbox AND spam folders for the next 48 hours, for this email. We will not begin processing an application without the information requested in that email. */*/*\n\nWe are happy to consider applicants from out of state on most dogs. Please read the description to see if this dog is an exception.  If the applicant is approved to adopt, they MUST be willing to come to our location in Troy, VA, for a meet and greet. If all parties agree that the pup and family are a good fit,  they would take the pup home at that time.\n\nFor more information about our mission and for an APPLICATION for adoption, please go to www.greendogsunleashed.com.\n\nGDU does ask a minimum adoption fee of $300.00. This does not even come close to covering all expenses created by animals while in rescue. We are funded solely by the angels and volunteers willing to donate time and finances. This minimum fee includes DAPP, rabies if age appropriate,, heartworm test and preventative, if age appropriate, and flea and tick treatment, as well as neutering or spaying, if the animal is medically sound to undergo surgery.  In an attempt to avoid tummy upset from a sudden change of food, the foster family may include a small, transitional bag of the food the dog/puppy has been eating. And if the dog/puppy has grown attached to a special item (like a toy or blanket), they may send that along, as well.\n\n*/*/*  Young puppies will receive age-appropriate vaccines, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters may be required to provide additional puppy boosters and at 16 weeks of age, a rabies vaccine. Future annual vaccines, testing and monthly heartworm preventative are REQUIRED, and will be the financial responsibility of the adopter.",

All children in the home must be at least 5 years of age. We appreciate your understanding of these policies. \n\n  Lucille might be a youngster but this little sweetheart loves nothing more than sitting in her foster moms lap. She came to us from East TX where she was surrendered with 5 other dogs. She is a super sweet little girl who gets along great with other animals. She can be just a little shy meeting new people but she warms up very quickly and then is a total love. As of 1/27 she is approx 4 months old. \n\nLike all puppies, Lucille needs an adopter who is willing to train and work with her to help her be the best dog she can be.\n\nIf you would like to meet Lucille, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.So sweet, so soft, with only one wish in the world...to be loved and cuddled, Bichon Buddy has waited all his life for a person to whom he can give his heart and little body. He hasn't given up. He is still hoping, after a lifetime of neglect. A safe, quiet, loving environment is what we are seeking for this small boy. Sadly, it's something he has never had. He's grown older, still imagining what it would be like to be cared for. He's started to get the creaks and problems that come to an aging dog, but still, he waits. Would you like to give this deserving boy this gift in his last years? Will you be his angel?Note from Buddy's foster: Buddy would love a home with another dog.\nIf you are interested in Bichon Buddy, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://reachoutrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4588 Or contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

I am a 3 year old pocket sized pittie girl and currently weigh around 40 pounds. I am quite an active girl, and I am looking for a family to spend lots of time with and get some of my energy out. I just LOVE to run! I tend to play a little rough with my doggy friends, so I would do best with an active dog that is my size or larger. I am a sweet girl that loves to have your attention. I have a sensitive tummy, so I need to have a grain free diet. I am looking for a home with older kids (13+).\n\nMy adoption fee is $250.00. I am spayed, microchipped, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and up to date on all vaccinations.",

He is now almost housebroken, crate trained and has mastered some basic commands.   He is being fostered with 2 dogs and a cat, and would do well in a variety of situations provided a family is committed to continuing his positive training.   At only 4-5 months old, he is a beautiful medium sized pup.    He is current on vaccines, neutered, and chipped.\n\nAt the time you are seeing this post, Hero is still available for adoption. But please know that we may be working on multiple applications already, and any one of them could be approved at any time. Please READ THIS ENTIRE DESCRIPTION and complete an adoption application, if you are interested in any of our animals. Application at www.greendogsunleashed.org   If you send an inquiry to ask if the dog is still available, or just tell us you are interested, your inquiry will not be answered. FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. We can do NOTHING without that. No, we cannot tell you if he would be a match for your family without seeing an application.  PLEASE KEEP READING for info.\n\n*/*/* PLEASE NOTE:  The first communication you will receive after completing an application will be an email response, which will have instructions on how to proceed. Please check your inbox AND spam folders for the next 48 hours, for this email. We will not begin processing an application without the information requested in that email. */*/*\n\nWe are happy to consider applicants from out of state on most dogs. Please read the description to see if this dog is an exception.  If the applicant is approved to adopt, they MUST be willing to come to our location in Troy, VA, for a meet and greet. If all parties agree that the pup and family are a good fit,  they would take the pup home at that time.\n\nFor more information about our mission and for an APPLICATION for adoption, please go to www.greendogsunleashed.com.\n\nGDU does ask a minimum adoption fee of $300.00. This does not even come close to covering all expenses created by animals while in rescue. We are funded solely by the angels and volunteers willing to donate time and finances. This minimum fee includes DAPP, rabies if age appropriate,, heartworm test and preventative, if age appropriate, and flea and tick treatment, as well as neutering or spaying, if the animal is medically sound to undergo surgery.  In an attempt to avoid tummy upset from a sudden change of food, the foster family may include a small, transitional bag of the food the dog/puppy has been eating. And if the dog/puppy has grown attached to a special item (like a toy or blanket), they may send that along, as well.\n\n*/*/*  Young puppies will receive age-appropriate vaccines, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters may be required to provide additional puppy boosters and at 16 weeks of age, a rabies vaccine. Future annual vaccines, testing and monthly heartworm preventative are REQUIRED, and will be the financial responsibility of the adopter.",

She is also fine with her fosters cats.  She will need continued positive training and a family who understands how to provide good reasonable structure and boundaries.   In return she promises the sweetest of snuggle and most fun at the park.  \nAt the time you are seeing this post, Becca is still available for adoption. But please know that we may be working on multiple applications already, and any one of them could be approved at any time.

PLEASE KEEP READING for info.\n\n*/*/* PLEASE NOTE:  The first communication you will receive after completing an application will be an email response, which will have instructions on how to proceed.

This minimum fee includes DAPP, rabies if age appropriate,, heartworm test and preventative, if age appropriate, and flea and tick treatment, as well as neutering or spaying, if the animal is medically sound to undergo surgery.  In an attempt to avoid tummy upset from a sudden change of food, the foster family may include a small, transitional bag of the food the dog/puppy has been eating. And if the dog/puppy has grown attached to a special item (like a toy or blanket), they may send that along, as well.\n\n*/*/*  Young puppies will receive age-appropriate vaccines, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption.

            "description": "Our Aptly named Summer reminds me a lot of the 90\u2019s pop band LFO.   Happy tune, sweet sounding lyrics, but really all over the place and random....with little in the way of making coherent sense.  \nSure that isn\u2019t a description that is going to sell this dog.   But the reality is this overgrown puppy is going to need an owner who doesn\u2019t need to be sold on her.   She has had a really crappy first year of life.  Clearly she had never been on leash or in a house or ever EVER given any actual direction or stimulation in life.   She missed a LOT.   She missed how to play with toys, she missed how to play with dogs, and she missed how to expend energy outside of her chain and 3 foot circle.   Thankfully what she was given was clearly a naturally stunning disposition because this girl wants nothing more than to be touched and rubbed on.    Summer is going to need to learn EVERYTHING related to how to be an actual dog.   She is good with other dogs in the sense of existing next to them but will need to learn they can be fun playmates.   She needs to learn how to walk on leash.   We are working on this but right now she is a bullet out of gun and has no concept she should walk with you, rather than....\u201doh look there is a squ....hi are you New here?...oh I smell hotdogs!\u201d  \nSummer is currently a very high energy dog.  I am unsure if this is purely survival mode for her...expend all the energy you can at any given moment before you get chained again....or if it is just her.    What you see may very well be what you get.   As she is new here we will be continuing to evaluate this, though I suspect a home with a solid history of training and perhaps a job to do might be best.   She will find things to do and keep herself occupied but will need direction to not destroy your favorite metal food bowl.   Summer promises she gives the best snuggles.   For all the man handling I did to her myself today, she wanted nothing more than for me to touch her.   And touch her I did.   Ears, feet, tum, face...she melted into my legs and onto her back.   For as wild a child as this girl is, she is truly a lover at heart.   \nWe need a family with a LOT of patience.  This dog is NOT turnkey and will be a challenge.   A rewarding one for sure, but there will be frustration and hard work ahead.   Experience with a high drive dog is a must.   I have no idea how she is with cats.    \nIf you think you are up for a Challenge and can promise Summer the rest of forever, please fill out an application on our website.    For those of you just looking for a pretty Rotti face, enjoy her pics, but please understand this is not the dog for you. \n\nAt the time you are seeing this post, Summer is still available for adoption.

            "description": "Buckeroo came to NCCR as a stray on January 26th.  What we have learned so far is he is quiet and friendly.  Buckeroo weighs between 25 & 30 lbs. He doesn't seem to mind all of the other dogs around him, but we haven't paired him with any other dogs.  We have no history on Buckeroo so do not know if he is good with cats.  \n\nBuckeroo  is neutered, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. \n\nHis adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nBuckeroo is sponsored by: Kayme Crowell, Kevin and Barbara Kantz, Diane Weakley, Steve and Diane Mogavero, Jane and Joe McMaster and Linda Bradigan in memory of Shaleigh and Rich. Phoebe is also sponsored by Rae Connolly. Thank you everyone!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.

She's looking for a person who will love her as unconditionally as she will love them, and who wants to share their life with an adoring dog. There is no doubt this girl will keep you moving! She would love a place to live that has lots of safe space for her, preferably a fenced-in yard. As much as she would enjoy hiking or long walks, it's very stressful for her to see other dogs, and that's a very common occurrence on trails, so a life-style that doesn't involve those meetings would be best for her. Abileen LOVES to ride in the car, especially if you find yourself at a drive-thru!\n\nAbileen has really improved with her impulse control, but she's easily excited, and still jumps a bit when greeting, so she would not be a good match for a family with small children. She was found as a stray with another dog, but now she says she only wants the company of humans. When Abileen has seen cats, she clearly wants to chase, so she should not live where cats are nearby.\n\nDogs: No\n\nCats: No\n\nKids: 13+",

            "description": "Spicy was seen many times running on the reservation with other dogs and begging for food at various porches. Then a very pregnant Spicy was caught by going into a fenced yard and being closed in. She had her puppies and was taken in by NCCR. She raised her beautiful beagle pups and they have all gone on to new forever homes. She is in need of a family who will take the time needed to allow her to trust humans.   She is very calm, lets you pet her, pick her up and love her but does not yet respond to a loving touch. She may have been on her own for her entire 2 years of life. She will always look up at you when you come into the area or room and acknowledge your presence but does not come to you. She is a beautiful beagle, on the small side at under 20 pounds but so deserving of a home with people who have patience and tons of love to give to this little lost soul.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Spicy requires a fenced yard.\n\nSpicy is spayed, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nSpicy is kindly sponsored by Phillip and Carol Baideme in memory of Sam Heath Forster, Roberta Gray, Victor and Gloria Armes, Kayme Crowell, Daniel Farnham, Kayme Crowell, Ann Odell, Tillie Mae and Bron Bron, Dave and Nancy Nuzzo, Lisa and Jason Weaver, Dawn Tunstall and Mark Zafuto and  Barbara Nodes-Nokoski.  Thank you!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

He needs an active home, with someone that will take him for lots of long walks and hikes - 2 very long walks per day at the very least. He has a bit of separation anxiety, so a home where he has company throughout the day or has a canine sibling to keep him company. Joe needs people that can read his cues, as he does sometimes growl. So he needs a patient home that is willing to work on this.\n\nName: Joe\n\nAge: approximately 5 years old\n\nBreed: German Shepherd Mix\n\nWeight: 62lbs\n\nGender: Male\n\nEnergy level: High. Joe needs a minimum of 10K walking distance per day. If he is not exercised enough he will pace around the home and not settle. He will sit at the door and paw at it. \n\nGood with dogs: If properly introduced to a dog he has been consistently good and enjoys their company. However, he will sometimes growl at dogs as they pass by on a walk. Still, he would do well with a canine sibling.\n\nGood with cats: No. He has a high prey drive\n\nGood with kids (+ ages): Joe should be in a home without kids.\n\nGood with strangers: Joe was abused in the past, so he needs time to trust humans. He is not overly friendly with strangers, but mostly just ignores them. When introduced to new people, he needs a lot of time to warm up to them, and does not enjoy when new people are trying to touch him. \n\nGuarding issues: He will sometimes growl when on the coach, but does not guard food, toys, etc\n\nBehavioural issues: He growls at people when they touch him/lean over him when he sits on the couch in the evening.\n\nHouse trained: Yes\n\nCrate trained: Joe has crate hate. He will paw at it the whole time. However, he is very calm and not destructive/not a chewer, so he is fine to be left alone with free roam of the house.\n\nSeparation anxiety: A little bit. He can been left alone for 2-3 hours.\n\nDestructive: Not at all. \n\nLeash skills: Great. He is easy to walk and responds to commands. He is very smart and quickly learns what his humans\u2019 want. However, he does lunge at squirrels. \n\nOkay with manipulations: Once he trusts you he will let you touch him and roll on his back for belly rubs. He lets strangers and new people pet his head. \n\nMedical issues: No\n\nOther notes such as overall observations, personality, etc: Joe is a calm boy with an old soul. He is very curious, and wants to sniff and know what everything is before he relaxes. He loves being outside and exploring all of the smells. He enjoys being part of a pack - having another dog around gives him a bit more confidence on what is right and wrong, and when he can relax. At home, he is very friendly. He walks up and sticks his nose in front of you for pets and loves all the attention he can get. He is very treat motivated and eager to please, and will make any family happy.",

I like to play with other dogs, but I can be a little bossy. I would definitely like to meet any dogs you might have at home to see if they share my same play style. I like most any kind of toy, so maybe we could go shopping to pick something out for me! Wouldn't that be fun? Come see me, and maybe take me home!\n\nTake me on a Slumber Party! You can bring me home for a 3 day - 30 day trial period. HSSC will provide food, medications, and necessities. If I'm not the one for you, just bring me back to HSSC and provide feedback on what would be the best home for me.",

            "description": "New kid on the block Hudson would like to make your acquaintance. This 10-12 momth old sweet friendly boy is just a puppy still, in a big adolescent body.  He is good with others dogs but a bit too much for kitties.   He seems to want to play with everyone.  He is working on his basic commands and walking nicely on lead.   He is eager to please and a great big ball of fun and gooberlishess.  He will need a family committed to continuing positive training methods to help him be the best he can be.  Hudson will be neutered Tuesday and ready to find his forever family!\n\nAt the time you are seeing this post, Hudson is still available for adoption. But please know that we may be working on multiple applications already, and any one of them could be approved at any time. Please READ THIS ENTIRE DESCRIPTION and complete an adoption application, if you are interested in any of our animals. Application at www.greendogsunleashed.org   If you send an inquiry to ask if the dog is still available, or just tell us you are interested, your inquiry will not be answered. FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. We can do NOTHING without that. No, we cannot tell you if he would be a match for your family without seeing an application.  PLEASE KEEP READING for info.\n\n*/*/* PLEASE NOTE:  The first communication you will receive after completing an application will be an email response, which will have instructions on how to proceed. Please check your inbox AND spam folders for the next 48 hours, for this email. We will not begin processing an application without the information requested in that email. */*/*\n\nWe are happy to consider applicants from out of state on most dogs. Please read the description to see if this dog is an exception.  If the applicant is approved to adopt, they MUST be willing to come to our location in Troy, VA, for a meet and greet. If all parties agree that the pup and family are a good fit,  they would take the pup home at that time.\n\nFor more information about our mission and for an APPLICATION for adoption, please go to www.greendogsunleashed.com.\n\nGDU does ask a minimum adoption fee of $300.00. This does not even come close to covering all expenses created by animals while in rescue. We are funded solely by the angels and volunteers willing to donate time and finances. This minimum fee includes DAPP, rabies if age appropriate,, heartworm test and preventative, if age appropriate, and flea and tick treatment, as well as neutering or spaying, if the animal is medically sound to undergo surgery.  In an attempt to avoid tummy upset from a sudden change of food, the foster family may include a small, transitional bag of the food the dog/puppy has been eating. And if the dog/puppy has grown attached to a special item (like a toy or blanket), they may send that along, as well.\n\n*/*/*  Young puppies will receive age-appropriate vaccines, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters may be required to provide additional puppy boosters and at 16 weeks of age, a rabies vaccine. Future annual vaccines, testing and monthly heartworm preventative are REQUIRED, and will be the financial responsibility of the adopter.",

He is looking for an active family who would love to keep up with his go, go, go energy! Smokey is house trained and crate trained. He hasn't met a dog or person he doesn't like! We are unsure about cats at this time, but he does like to chase squirrels and rabbits and doesn't always listen to stop. Smokey also has not been around children. We don't anticipate any issues, but because of his size and energy level, a younger child may get knocked over. So we would like a home with older children only. Smokey does not guard anything and seems to be the all-around perfect mixer! He's hoping to find a family of his own to adore!\n\nAll pets adopted from GDHS are spayed or neutered, have vaccinations brought up to date, are on heartworm preventative (dogs), FIV/FELV tested (cats) and microchipped.\nThe Greater Derry Humane Society does not have a physical shelter, and all visits are by appointment only.",

            "description": "Hello everypawdy! My name is Cami and you can recognize me by my big brown eyes. In fact, the only thing bigger than them is my heart! I am about 40 lbs. and a super joyful girl who loves the simple life. Being around my humans makes me super happy. The only thing that makes me happier is getting petted. It doesn't matter where, I'm not picky! I am pretty athletic, and if you want to go for a run, I am more than happy to keep up. I could be your perfect running buddy! Did I forget to mention that I get along famously with little dogs? My previous partner in crime is a Pomeranian and we did everything together, from playing tug of war to wrestling, no game is off limits to us. I can be super low profile if you need me to be, completely kennel trained and potty trained - I am a patient lady. So if you are looking for a patient, loving, energetic brown eyed girl, well I'm your girl. I would do best in a home with older children and a fenced yard to run around! If you are interested in meeting me please email foster.help@cityoffortwayne.org as I am still hanging out in a foster home. I looking forward to meeting you!",

If youve seen the Lord of the Rings, you know these two ladies both love the same dude, but theyve put all that behind them. Sisters before misters, amiright ladies?!? Arwen is a little bit out of her element here at the shelter, and can be a bit shy. Shes hoping to leave for a quieter, cozy home where she can relax and gain confidence. Arwen mostly kept to herself when meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, and should meet any resident pets before heading home. What if the resident dog isnt a LOTR fan???",

We do not have a facility in NJ to meet before adoption. We ask that you visit your local shelters/rescues first.. We do not adopt to MA or RI or NH residents.\n\nI am 14 wks old and weigh approx 14 lbs. I am loving and energetic. I play well with other dogs and  children. I am up to date on all age appropriate vaccines and neutered. I am expected to weigh 25-30 lbs when grown. I was dumped out on a lonely rural road at a very young age. I was rescued by a lovely lady and brought to BTHAR.\n I will need leash training. I am eager to learn new things. I am crate trained.\n\nLike us on Facebook.com/BTHAR2013\nFor more information on adoption please contact: adoptions.BTHAR@gmail.com",

Speaking of bubbly, Champagnes name is very fitting. She is a happy go lucky dog, who is always looking for a good time. She loves other dogs and would be a great companion with sturdy children as well! Champagne came to us after a housefire had left her and her canine friend Confetti homeless. Champagne has made the best of her situation though and enjoys everyone and everything. She loves going for walks, rolling in the snow/grass and of course getting treats! If you would like to add some bubbles to your life, come check Champagne out!",

He is super affectionate with people and loves to snuggle. If you don't want a dog who likes to be on your bed or under the covers with you, then Sticks isn't your guy. This is his favorite thing ever! He much prefers to relax than be active. Sticks also loves to eat and will do a happy dance of circles when he sees his food come out! He is potty trained, but is working on not marking in the house so wears a belly band right now.\nSticks is curious about cats but just wants to be friends with them. He can be selective about other dogs and requires a proper introduction. Sticks loves his humans so can be territorial when it comes to other submissive dogs. He tends to not want to share but can do ok with commands and training. He has not been around children, but we are looking for a home without younger kids. He doesn't love loud noises and may nip if his things are taken while he is chewing them.\nIf you are looking for a loyal best friend to spend your days cuddling with, Sticks is waiting to hear from you!\n\nAll pets adopted from GDHS are spayed or neutered, have vaccinations brought up to date, are on heartworm preventative (dogs), FIV/FELV tested (cats) and microchipped.\nThe Greater Derry Humane Society does not have a physical shelter, and all visits are by appointment only.",

We affectionately refer to him as a \"level 5 clinger\", so if you're looking for the ultimate best friend, he's definitely your guy! Fred's ideal environment is a home with a yard available to romp in rather than an apartment. He has met several dogs here at RACC and seems to prefer the company of calm, submissive types rather than excitable playmates. That said, he would also do just fine as an only dog so he can soak up all of your attention! Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 75.5lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 1wks",

We estimate him to be around 2 years old. \n\nHe is great in the crate and is so grateful and humble.  We have not cat tested him yet.   Sebastian is very affectionate and loves to be petted.  \n\nWe can\u2019t say enough good things about Sebastian!\n\nSebastian was found as a stray in very rural Georgia. \n\n\nIf interested, please contact Christine at christinerescueexpress@gmail.com",

We do not have any other information on this pet as it is not part of our program.   If you are interested please go to whsadopt.org and fill out the \"dog adoption questionnaire\".  We will forward it to the owner and they will contact you directly.  \n\nZazu is a loyal and loving little fella! He is a 20lb yellow lab mixed with a pomeranian. Although he is 9 years old, he has a lot of life left to live. He's in good health, has lots of energy & loves walks but his favorite way to pass the time is a movie night with popcorn while snuggling on your lap.  He does have anxiety of anything that moves fast (barks aggressively/growls at cars, squirrels, other animals and kids). He can be territorial over his people, things and space so he would be best suited for an adult only home. He is very smart and knows lots of fun tricks. He is house trained, crate trained, up-to-date on his shots and is neutered. He has a lot of love left to give to someone who is patient and excited to spend time with him. \n\n",

She would do best in an active family with older children. She plays with other dogs but can play rough at times. So a meet and greet with potential fur friends is suggested. Marleigh has suffered a broken leg as a stray and by the time she was rescued it had mostly healed. It doesn't slow her down and she is in no pain. She walks fine and runs like the wind. So if you are looking for a fun and active buddy, Marleigh is your girl.\n\n \n\n \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.",

Because she is still puppy brained, sometimes her over excitement can be confused (by other dogs) as aggression. This is NOT the case but during introductions and the first few weeks or so, redirections may be needed so Sissy can learn about other dogs, their play style, and how to mesh in well with her new family. She responds very well to positive reinforcement. She has been around LOTS of dogs, big, small, males and females. Once she realizes her role and placement, she is the happiest go lucky girl you will EVER meet! We compare her temperment to a teenager:awkward and trying to find her place in the world.\n\nSissy does do well with kids, but because she's not always aware of her size, we suggest children in the home being 10 and older.\n\nShe is so super smart and would make an excellent hiking and running buddy! She absolutely LOVES activity in her life and needs to remain very active and keep her brain and body in motion.\n\nShe is about 45 pounds now but will be about 55 or so full grown. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

We don\u2019t know how he lost his home and ended up stray, but he sure is doing great in his foster home while he waits for his forever family to find him.\n\nHis foster mom says \u201cManny is awesome. He is for sure a lap baby who loves to snuggle under the covers with you. He likes people better than dogs! He is super sweet with my cats, but that he\u2019d prefer to be an only dog since he wants to be king of the castle!\u201d\n\nManny is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines and preventives. If you\u2019d like to adopt this great little guy please go to doubledogrescue.org and send us your application or contact marisab@doubledogrescue.org for an application.\n\nApplications can be found on our website [Doubledogrescue.org] (https://doubledogrescue.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DDR-Application_2020_Form.pdf)\n\nAdoptions in CT, NY, NJ, RI, VT, NH, ME, PA, - NOT MASSACHUSETTS, due to canine quarantine restrictions.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER: The specific breed of any dog abandoned to shelter is the best guess by seasoned rescuers in accord with our veterinarians.",

Loves to be the center of attention in her family. She can beat you at cuddling during an all day Netflix binge or during an all day hike. She is also more than happy to take care of any left-overs you don\u2019t want. Ariyah is approximately 4 years old and she has maintained her weight of 50lbs the last few years, so we dont expect her to get bigger. \n\nAriyah is house trained, up to date on shots and crate trained, although she prefers to be with her human. \n\nHer ideal home would be with older kids (6 years and up) and to a home where she can be an only dog. \nShe has high energy so she's looking for an owner that is willing to devote their time and attention to her. \n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me.

            "description": "Meet Barkley. Just shy of 6 months  old, this little guy (currently 38 pounds) is a ball of snuggly energy.  Loves playing with other dogs (especially chase me), going for long walks, eating (he can't get enough food!) and when he's finally worn out, he loves nothing more than to snuggle and cuddle with his people. \n\nBarkley is house trained and really good about not getting into things he shouldn't be, and if he starts to show some interest in something you'd rather he not have, he's happy to swap it out for a chew bone.\n\nBarkley is learning to sit nicely (instead of jumping up) and to use his inside of voice (instead of barking).  He's a work in progress, but he's very smart and wants to please.  He's a very sweet boy.\n\nMight he just be the perfect addition for your home?  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckqvTQOEd0g&feature=youtu.be\n\nFor more info on Barkley, check out his blog:\n\nhttps://brooklinelabrescue.org/blog/barkley-black-labrador-retriever-mix-male-4-months-old-id-2834/\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  While Barkley may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. \n\nFor more information on this Lab, please contact INFO@BROOKLINELABRESCUE.ORG.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, www.brooklinelabrescue.org, for more information on our adoption process. If you need additional information about the adoption process or whether you are in our coverage area, please send an e-mail to our Rescue at info@brooklinelabrescue.org\n\nEven if you are not ready to adopt, you can still help us help our Labs!\n\nBrookline Labrador Retriever Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit volunteer organization funded entirely by donations. Donations are always needed to help with veterinary costs, transportation, and supplies for our dogs. For information on donating to BLRR please click here.

Jena would prefer a home without other dogs or small children where she can adapt to her new home in a calm environment.  Jena is in excellent health and would enjoy an active family, perhaps a country home or cottage.  Jena will not be placed in an apartment and requires a secure back yard where she can play safely with her family.\n\nDo not contact Woof Rescue directly.\n\nPlease send an inquiry via email to  hlwrain@gmail.com",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nThis prime cut beagle mix boy is T-BONE, a handsome young fellow looking for a furever home. T-Bone and his sister Scampi were found on the run in and landed in a rural shelter. We busted them out of the joint with the promise of a loving furever home. T-Bone is a good-natured hound who loves people, good with other dogs, not cat tested yet. He needs a furever home with a physically fenced yard to prevent him from going on walkabout again -- beagles are notorious for following their noses into trouble. T-Bone is about a year old and fully grown at 35 lbs. If you'd like to meet this good natured guy, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nElsa and Merida are 13 week old female Shepherd mix pups. They are typical puppies - working on house training and love to cuddle.\n\nThis pup is micro-chipped and up to date on all vaccinations, and spayed. The new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing. The pup's adoption fee is $375. Please note ARF does not approve applications for any puppy under 6 months of age to families that live outside of Illinois and/or beyond 100 miles of Wheaton or Glen Ellyn, IL. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting this pup fill out an online application today! https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/ Once your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting. ARF is an all volunteer organization. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions until your application has been approved. Thank you for your patience!\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

I'm a very good boy and super playful. I am a growly player and love to play tug and fetch. When I've gotten all my zoomies out, then we can snuggle up on the couch together. I make the cutest little piggie grunts and I snore a little too -- sorry! I am a big boy and don't know my own strength so I might knock down younger kids. Sometimes when I see other dogs outside I might bark and pull very hard, but I'm working on my training! My friends in the Behavior department are so nice that they want to keep helping me be the best dog I can be even after I leave and find my forever home. I've been treated for some skin allergies while at the shelter and I'm feeling tons better [and my handsome self is finally coming through!] I'm on a medication called Apoquel long term to help prevent me from getting itchy but I take my pill like a champ. Are you looking for a side kick that'll turn heads and also make you laugh. Do you need a 60 pound lap dog? Then pick me, Thor! \n\n**Thor comes with FREE TRAINING! Included in your adoption fee, you will have access to Module One: Understanding your Reactive Dog. This is the first step to addressing your dog's on-leash behavior - understanding why they do what they do!** \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting this pet, click the [Adopt me] button to apply. \nFind a link to adopt this pet on our website: https://www.mdspca.org/humane-care/adopt/ \n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 60.8lbs Age: 2yrs 11mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

My ideal day is a long leisurely walk followed by lots of snuggle time on the couch with my head in your lap. I love a good routine and I can get a little nervous and timid around new things. But give me a little time to settle in and we'll be cuddling and playing in no time! I'm a bed/couch hog! As soon as we're comfy together I'll be lounging hardcore all the time!\n\nI love to play and chew- especially tennis balls! They're my favorite! and I am very good at knowing what's mine to play with and what's not. You don't have to worry about me getting into trouble in the house. A peanut butter filled kong makes my heart go pitter patter! \n\nTheodora is a \"Lucky 7\" pet so her adoption fee is $0!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting this pet, click the [Adopt me] button to apply. \nFind a link to adopt this pet on our website: https://www.mdspca.org/humane-care/adopt/ \n\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Brown Brindle Weight: 53lbs Age: 10yrs 2mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed",

We are not sure how he is with kitties but he can be cat tested for the right home. \nHank would do great in a home with another dog around his size and age to play with. We also think, due to his size, kids eight and up would be best. Interested adopters must have a physically contained yard and be committed to continued training.

But so far they say he\u2019s sweetheart \u2013 loves his ears rubs and hugs. He\u2019s a face kisser! Could use more groceries, a little on the skinny side. He\u2019s gone good with the kids he\u2019s met so far. \n\nHe was picked up with other dog (since adopted) and they got along really great! He\u2019s walked along the other shelter dogs kennels and hasn\u2019t growled or shown aggression. But since he\u2019s new and the shelter can be overwhelming at first - he hasn\u2019t had direct contact with any other dogs yet. \n\nAdoption Fee: $100\n\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccinations and microchipping.\n\n---\nLearn more about the adoption process and download our questionnaire at https://nodawayhumanesociety.wordpress.com/adopt/",

            "description": "Porter is a very undersocialized 9 month old corgi / rat terrier puppy, who is still trying to figure out what it means to be a house dog. He was raised outside his whole life, and it's clear he didn't have much contact with people during that time. He has very specific needs, so please read his entire bio before applying.\nPorter is a HUGE flight risk, which is similar to other dogs we've rescued from puppy mills. He will take any and every opportunity to bolt out the front door, and even will need leashed in a fenced yard for the foreseeable future. As such, we will NOT adopt him to anyone will small kids. This is non-negotiable, as we've had experience with kids letting dogs run out the front door and they've been lost or hit by cars. We try our best to set our dogs up for success, so please do not ask us to be flexible on this requirement. He will also need a secure, fenced yard that a 10 lbs puppy can't fit through.\nPorter is not housebroken. He will need a patient owner, willing to deal with getting him through his puppy phase! We are also able to offer FREE training in the prison program to a new adopter, once the program reopens later this year.\nPorter IS fully crate trained! His foster home has been a rockstar with this and it's paid off!\nHe also MUST HAVE a confident canine playmate, willing to show him the ropes! As you can see from his photos, he loves his Akita brother, and benefits greatly from following another dog and learning how to trust humans. He's shown no interest or aggression towards the cats in the home.\nPorter has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and is heartworm negative. His adoption fee is $350. If you are interested in Porter and meet all of his adoption requirements, please apply on our website, www.prodogsohio.org/adoptables.\nHe's being fostered in London, OH. Please note, we only schedule meet and greets with approved applicants. We are not currently hosting adoption events due to Covid.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe appreciate your support, in order to help us continue to rescue dogs! Donations can be made via our PayPal account - info@prodogsohio.org.\nYou must be willing to commute to the location that the pet is being fostered in order to be eligible to adopt. We do not ship our pets. We also require that you personally bring the pet back to us should the adoption not work out.\nWe do NOT negotiate adoption fees. All money goes to support our rescue operation. We are 100% volunteered based.\nWe require your current dog(s) to be current on vaccines and heartworm prevention.\nApply online at www.prodogsohio.org, under the Adoptables tab.\nDue to the volume of apps and inquiries, we may not be able to respond to everyone.",

I am very shy and will need some love and patience, so I continue to progress. I get along well with other dogs and they bring me out of my shyness, so if you have a dog it would be best if we met to make sure we are friends. I would love a family of my own with a fenced in back yard to run and play in. Also, I like to go on walks, but can get nervous if I hear loud noises.  \n\nIf interested in meeting Max, please complete an adoption application. Hi there, my name is Max.

We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me? Click here to fill out an application!Happy Tails Rescue Minnesota is located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley MN 55432. We are open for adoption events from 12-5 every Sunday. If there is a certain animal you want to meet at one the events please fill out a preadoption application to directly contact their foster family or check our Facebook page to see if they will be there! Their event attendance is based on the availability of their foster family.\nHome visits (video tours or in person) are required for all dog adoptions.

            "description": "Bonnie is very smart and sweet est. 4 year old Hu-Nose breed found as a stray.\u00a0 She weighs about 45 lbs.\u00a0 Photos do not do justice to her beautiful chocolate coat with varying shades of highlights.\u00a0 She has had puppies sometime in her past but she is done with all that now ! She is a little fearful at first and with anything new.\u00a0 However, she adapts very quickly and has been making great progress in learning trust.\u00a0 If she feels cornered, she will let you know with a warning snap but I haven't seen this behavior since the beginning of her stay.\u00a0 Otherwise if she is wary of you, she will avoid you.\n\nShe wants to be a very active girl and loves to run BIG zoomies in the yard.\u00a0 She needs a family who can work with that energy and develop her full potential.\u00a0 Even with this energy, she is pretty well behaved in the house and  does very well in a crate or ex-pen.\u00a0  She has done quite well crated in the car for trips several hours long.\n\nBonnie will require a home with a fenced yard.\u00a0 She needs room to run and due to her being prone to cautiousness of new people and situations, we do not want her to become a stray again !\n\nBonnie needs an experienced dog family.   We are working with trainers with Bonnie to overcome her fear issues with new people.   She is so super smart and learns very quickly but it is taking longer to learn about that trust with strangers.  She is making progress.  She knows SIT and will SIT, WAIT, LOOK when her food bowl is put down and then goes for it when given the signal !   Bonnie is looking for a family that has experience training dogs so she can continue her learning and a family that likes to be active, as she is very athletic !  She has been comfortable with men and women that she has learned to trust.   Bonnie's adoption would be a transition at this point to make sure she's comfortable with her new family and they are comfortable with her.  It would start with a series of brief meetings with Bonnie.\n\nShe has done ok with some dogs but not with others that try to intimidate her.  She should be in an only dog home or in controlled situations with other dogs to insure safety of all.\n\nBonnie Raitt was heartworm positive but has finished her treatments now.  She will be retested in March to confirm the heartworms are gone.",

Lexi is outgoing as most huskies are but does take Phenobarbital to prevent seizures which surfaced in 2019. \nSophia is a bit shy till she gets to know you, then it is all good and play is on.  They love to be outside but are housebroken.  They are good with other dogs as well.   If you would like to meet these divas, contact Veronica at 463-224-4868.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Debbie at debbied@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Athena\nEstimated Breed : St. Bernard mix\nApproximate Age: 8-9 months\nApproximate Weight: approx. 60 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nJust look at that smile - this young lady just loves everyone! She would make an excellent family dog for a family that knows about large breeds. Athena is still growing and will need room to run and play. Athena is a super sweet and friendly girl who would make a great family dog. She is super sweet with people and gets along with other dogs. While she has her moments of energy, she can also be relatively laid-back and loves to give her humans \"hugs\". Will you give this big girl a loving family and home?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me?

Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me?

She has been through a rough start in life and is shy with new people.  Once she settles down in a home, you will see her sweet and loving side.  Brussels loves her humans, gentle with children, and good with dogs of all sizes.  Brussels is doing very well in her foster home and ready for her forever home.   Brussels started some leash training and is learning at a good pace.  She is crate-trained and doing well on her housetraining.  She rides well in the car and can wait patiently while her foster mom runs errands.  We are looking for a committed home to continue to socialize/train her and be patient with her during the transition period.  \n\nBRUSSELS\u2019s Rescue Story\n\nBrussels and her daughter, Brighton, were abandoned under a bridge with a pack of over 60 stray dogs.  They are living in horrible conditions and have no shelter and food.  The founder of a rescue organization got a rescue call.  The founder and her volunteers took 3 cars and drove down to the location.  A kind man who lives nearby and would often bring them some food.  He is the only person who cared for them.  People in the area were not nice and some would often beat them.  With the help of the kind man, the founder was able to catch 28 of them.  She cannot bear to see them suffer under the bridge.   Brussels and her buddies arrived at the founder\u2019s home at 1 am and they settled in nicely.  They were finally able to have a warm bed to sleep in.  She promised to find all of them homes so they can be treated with love and proper care.  \n\nBrussels had a thorough medical checkup.  She had been spayed, vaccinated, microchip, and passed negative on her blood tests.  Please give Brussels a loving home where she will never be left behind again. \n\nPlease watch BRUSSELS\u2019s YouTube videos below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jIkY55ztk0U - Brussels at foster home\nhttps://youtu.be/zv14gGaqAWk - Brussels no food aggression\nhttps://youtu.be/UUqDjbkXrM8 - Brussels meeting cats\nhttps://youtu.be/Ayxk45UtVAc - Brighton & Brussels good with volunteers\nhttps://youtu.be/VRZkZNTPuPY - Lucianna Brussels Wally walking\nhttps://youtu.be/GyHKjnlGi28 - Brussels gentle with a child\n\n\nIf you would like to give Brussels a forever home, please go to www.adoptadoggie.org to fill out an online application with your home photos.  \nYou can also email your home environment photos to contact@adoptadoggie.org  \nOnce we received your application, we will get back to you ASAP.  \n\nAdopt a Doggie Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Adopt-a-Doggie/312107112299799 \n\nTemperament:  \nEnergy Level:  Medium\nIdeal home environment:  Both Quiet & Active\nIs the dog good with strangers: Shy\nThe dog is best with children of what age group?

Everyone in the home should enjoy getting kisses \u2013 they\u2019re good luck! A true family dog, she will be happiest in a home with multiple humans to dote on her.\n\nCricket is initially timid with new people, but warms up very quickly. \n\nA SECURE PHYSICAL FENCE WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT HER.  \n\nShe loves to play with other dogs and would do well with a more confident, similarly aged canine companion, but we think she could be happy as an only dog as well. \n\nShe is not suited for a home with cats or small animals as she is too interested in playing with them. Cricket is housebroken, but gets nervous when left for long periods so her adopters should have a flexible schedule.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been longing for a cuddly, playful sock thief in your life, Cricket is your girl!\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\n\nDue to Massachusetts State Regulations we are unable to adopt to residents of Massachusetts at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\n** If you are interested in adopting this dog, you must first complete an adoption application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PEP/Dog/. Or visit our site (http://peppertree.org/category/available-for-adoption/) and learn about other Peppertree dogs. *Note: visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He does great with people, kids, and dogs. We just want him to live out the rest of his life like the first ten years - as a much beloved family member.

            "description": "Meet Priscilla, AKA Miss Prisc! The inspiration for her name was a male, so we chose to name her after his wife. She is an approximately 3-year-old Rat Terrier mix who came into our program for bad behavior at a local shelter. She spent approximately eight months in a spacious home, hiding under furniture, avoiding human interaction, mostly refusing love, and scared of collars and leashes. The freedom to adjust in her own time only allowed her to become more scared of humans and more reclusive. ? In December, we changed tactics and moved her to an active socialization fostering situation, and we are so glad we did!! In one month, she went from being so scared of humans she would fear bite to begging for her foster mom's attention and sleeping in her lap every chance she gets. She still has a ways to go. She's very timid with anyone new, but more timid with men. She takes treats from her foster mom and foster dad's hands. She no longer tries to bite anyone that reaches into her playpen to pet her or tries to pick her up. She no longer rolls or flails around to get away from a collar / halter and leash. She's still a bit scared of actually walking on a leash, but she is slowly figuring out that it isn't torture! ?\n\nThis sassy girl has attitude for days, but it is mostly rooted in her fear of human interactions. She will do amazing in a single human or one couple home (we are not sure a home with kids would be good for her), and would likely really prefer a woman to be her person. Once she feels comfortable and safe, though, she will be the sweetest love bug!\n\nShe will need a human who is willing to spend some time in the beggining helping her understand they are not a threat. She is very unlikely to immediately bond with any potential adopter / family. We anticipate her regressing slightly when she finds her forever home, just due to the severity of her fear of humans and fear of new things in general. She will do best staying in a large, enclosed playpen or kennel that opens from the top in the first couple to several weeks until she adjusts. That way her human can place a blanket over her to help her feel secure before picking her up. She LOVES soft fleece-like blankets. They are her very favorite place to curl up and nap! She is very fast when she gets scared and wants to get away, and will be hard to catch if she hasn't adjusted to the human trying to catch her. If she is let loose in the home, it may be a much harder and longer process to earn her trust. This is exemplified by the difference in how much progress she has made in a more controlled setting in such a short time compared to the little to no progress she previously made with too much freedom in the beggining. ?\n\nPriscilla is mostly potty pad trained, but she misses the pads occasionally and goes beside them. She is not kennel or house trained, but she is working on it! We do not expect this to take long once she feels a bit more comfortable on a leash / loose in the yard or her foster family is able to get an outdoor enclosure to use for her potty breaks (their yard is huge and they don't want her to get scared and find a hole in the fence or get hurt in a panicked state). Her fear of basically everything was our higher priority, but her foster mom is focusing on training more now that she feels safe!\n\nPriscilla might do best as an only pet, but we would be happy to consider a family with other small dogs or cats. She has been very reactive with large dogs (male and female) in our experience, but might be okay with a small to medium dog. She gets along with female cats, but does not appreciate male cats in her personal space.\n\nShe is spayed, micro-chipped, up to date on age appropriate shots, heartworm negative, and on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention!! She will be available for adoption in the next few weeks, but we are taking applications now. Www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application",

I love to go for walks outside and love to play with toys! I play well with other dogs! I would do best in a home without cats! I most likely will do well with kids toddler age and up, as long as we are supervised. The staff recommends that I be crated when I am home by myself to keep me safe. I am up to date on my vaccines, but I will need to see my new veterinarian within 2 weeks of my adoption to ensure that I stay healthy and keep on a regular vaccine schedule. My adoption fee is $100 If you are interested in adopting me or another homeless pet at Macomb County Animal Control, please complete an application at the link below and an adoption counselor will be in contact with you. https://animalcontrol.macombgov.org/AnimalControl-AdoptionApplication",

I am a super sweet playful little girl! I would most likely do well with kids of all ages as long as we are supervised! I am still a puppy, and I need an owner that understands I will need puppy obedience classes as well as ongoing housebreaking training! I am up to date on age appropriate vaccines, but I will need to see my new veterinarian within 2 weeks of my adoption, to ensure that I stay healthy and keep me on a regular vaccination schedule! I seem to be a little shy around other dogs, especially higher energy dogs, so if you have another dog in the family I will have to meet them first! My adoption fee is $400, which helps cover the cost of my care! If your are interested in adopting me or another homeless pet at Macomb County Animal Control, please complete an application at the link below and an adoption counselor will be in contact with you. https://animalcontrol.macombgov.org/AnimalControl-AdoptionApplication",

            "description": "Name: Uso-Diablo\n\nAge: 8 years\n\nGender: Male\n\nBreed: Lab/Collie Mix\n\nWeight: 48 lbs\n\nDog friendly: Yes\n\nCat friendly: Testing available upon request\n\nChild friendly: Yes, older dog\n\nsavvy children ages 5+, please\n\nHouse trained: Yes\n\nCrate trained: Yes\n\nEnergy level: Medium\n\nTemperament: Friendly, Playful,\n\nAffectionate\nRequirement: Not apartment appropriate, fenced yard\n\nAdoption Fee: $375+tax\n\nTo adopt, go to:\n\nwww.mendingspirits.org/apply-to-adopt.html\n\nFrom the Foster Family: Uso is a very friendly and loving dog who is looking for a family to call his own. He loves to play, whether it's a good game of fetch, running around in our fenced-in yard with another dog, or playing with some dog toys. He loves chewing on bones and toys and is great at \"de-stuffing\" the soft ones. He's been really good about knowing what's ok to chew on though and has not chewed on anything that he shouldn't. He typically likes to be close to his people and will come to sit with you on the couch for a little snuggle time, a belly rub, and even a few kisses!\n\nHe has learned how to sit and is getting pretty good at stay too. He is very motivated by treats and will work hard to earn them which is good because he is going to need some work with learning how to walk on a leash as he tends to pull quite a bit. In light of that, he would do great in a home with a fenced-in yard so he can get some exercise while being off-leash. At night, he's been sleeping in a crate and has done well with that, settling down quickly and sleeping quietly through the night. I'm sure he'd love to sleep in a dog bed, on a nice comfy couch, or on your bed too! Uso would make a great watchdog as he typically barks when he hears the door open. No one will sneak up on you when he's around! If you're looking for a fun, friendly, and loving addition to your family\n\n, Uso could be the guy for you!",

            "description": "Welcome Teddy to Lucky Dog Rescue. Teddy is a 11-12 month old Springer Spaniel weighing about 35lbs. Teddy is part of the China Rescue Dogs mission to save as many dogs as possible from the meat festival that coincides with Chinese New Year. We know Teddy was likely someone\u2019s pet that was discarded in March or April after the start of COVID when it was wrongly believed that pets carried the virus. Not true! It was somewhere around this time he was rescued and placed in a foster home. For months Teddy has been in a boarding facility getting up to date on his vaccinations ,neuter ,quarantine, passport and then finally his flight to New York USA! Teddy will arrive in the US on February 5th after nearly 35hrs of travel and then Lucky Dog will pick them up with the others on February 6th .During this time adopters will receive updates on their dogs and have access to the group chat and message group. On February 6th they will be available for meet and greets and to potentially head to their forever homes! Teddy is the happiest and sweetest boy! He loves everyone he meets. He does well with other dogs and surprisingly doesn\u2019t have an resource guarding issues!! Teddy being a young hunting breed dog has lots of energy and we suggest anyone considering adoption research the breed first. Teddy  is crate trained however he may not be receptive the crate after arrival. He will need help to reestablish housetraining after travel and being in a boarding facility. He is in perfect health and is fully up to date on all of his vaccinations, tests, and neuter. He will be microchipped and will be registered to Lucky Dog Rescue for the rest of his life. After Teddy has settled in at his forever home we will need to schedule him at one of our partner vet locations for his \u201ccherry eye\u201d repair surgery. The surgery will be covered by the rescue at one of our partner vet locations. It is a minimally invasive surgery to remove the second eyelid that has not grown in well. There won\u2019t be any issues long term for his Vision. Teddy\u2019s adoption fee will not be inexpensive. Due to border closures and needing to fly cargo, his flight alone without medical care is $750 for a dog his size. We are asking $950 minimally but appreciate anything beyond that to help other China dogs. Half of the $950 will need to be paid after the phone interview to hold him until February 6th. If the adoption isn\u2019t successful at time of meeting his deposit is returned. Teddy\u2019s entire fee will be going back to Chinarescuedogs.org to help get other dogs to freedom in the US. With all of our adoptions if at any point the adoption isn\u2019t successful within the first two weeks the entire adoption fee is returned. After the two weeks of the dogs need to be rehomed for any reason the dogs must be returned to the rescue.",

He comes to us from MS where he was a stray that keep showing up in people's yards then disappearing only to reappear in another.  This earned him the name Teller as in Penn & Teller, the magicians.  This is also typical behavior of a great pyr left off leash in an unfenced yard, they know no boundaries! \nLucky for Teller the nice folks at Union County Humane were finally able to catch him and he has been in foster care while getting him vaccinated, neutered and ready for his big trip north.\nWe believe Teller is just under a year old.  He is on the smaller side about 70 pounds so may still have a bit of growing to do.  He is very sweet and doing well learning to walk on a leash and crate training and not being a wandering man.\n\nIf you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application on our website:                          https://.barkdogfarm.rescuegroups.org/forms/ \n\nBefore applying be sure you have thoroughly researched Great Pyrenees.  They can be stubborn, prone to barking, overly protective and cannot be off leash.  You WILL NOT train a pyr to boundaries.  \nPlease be sure all family members are in agreement to adopting and your family is ready to bring dog home now. \nApplicants must be at least 21 years old. \nA volunteer will be in touch to discuss your application and the dog to determine if it is a good match. Your vet and two references will be called.  A virtual home visit done. Once approved a meet and greet at the farm will take place.  If all are in agreement and the animal has received its NH health certificate an adoption contract will be signed and adoption fee paid.  \nAdoption fees for dogs are $450. for adults over 12 months, $500 for puppies 12 months and younger.  Fees for seniors, special needs or harder to place dogs will be determined by our Board of Directors.\n All dogs will be altered when adoption is finalized, up to date on age appropriate core vaccines, negative for parasites, heart worm and lyme tested if 6 months or older, microchipped and have a current health certificate.  \nProof of a basic obedience course completed is part of our adoption contract within six months. \nOur descriptions are based on shelter evaluations, input from foster homes and interactions with our volunteers therefore are in no way a guarantee of temperament. \n\n! Please know we practice Covid-19 guidelines for mask wearing and social distancing.  Only approved applicants are allowed to meet our dogs outdoors at this time. Please email barkingdogfrm@gmail.com with any questions.",

He is a lab mix and weighs about 8 lbs. He is very sweet. He loves humans and dogs. Crate trained. Smart. Loving. We are looking for a home with a fenced yard or active adopter because he loves to run around and play. \n\nHe was rescued after being abandoned in Puerto Rico with her litter mates. He is available for adoption in Northern Virginia/DC/MD. We currently cannot do home visits in light of Covid-19 risks, so no homes with cats please since we cannot test whether they get along. \n\nPlease apply at www.Project-SecondChance.org. Our adoption fee is $500. Review our adoption procedures on our website BEFORE reaching out to us. Check us out on Facebook or Instagram for more information about our rescues. \n\nFB: @projectsecondchanceforsatos\nIG: project_second_chance\n\nIn lieu of an application fee, this rescue is participating in a support local campaign and asking that you shop at a local business in Alexandria VA to show community support. We believe that helping local small businesses through the pandemic is important. We kindly ask that you attach a receipt for $25 or more spent at: \n\n- The Dog Park, 705 King St, Alexandria, VA 22314. You can also purchase a gift certificate by phone at 703.888.2818.

I don\u2019t really know for sure, but I was brought to the shelter by Animal Control as a stray.  I don\u2019t know where my family is, because they never came to claim me! Now I hope to find a great new home.  I have all of my vaccinations for my age, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered. I am a four-month-old bulldog mix.  Now if you think you might want to adopt me please remember I am still a young puppy.  I will need training in good doggie manners, I will need lots of exercise and play time, and of course I will need lots and lots of love! After thinking about it, do you really have time for a puppy like me? Oh I sure hope you do!\n",

I am a sweet three-year-old terrier mix that was brought to the shelter by Animal Control! The deputies were so nice when they picked me up!  They knew I was lost and needed help finding my owners. After getting a nice dog run, a bowl of food, and a comfy bed I settled right in to wait for my family to claim me. As it turns out no one ever came and now I am looking for a new family to love. The shelter made sure I had all of my vaccinations, that I was heartworm negative, that I had a microchip, and that I was spayed.  I am now ready for a fresh start! Do you have room in your home for a nice dog like me?",

What do you see  first when you look at Boomer??? You see a BIG SMILE as he is one happy, happy, joy, joy dog!!!  Boomer was found as a stray in Lake Butler, FL.  Despite it all, this boy just loves life. and you can't help but smile when you see him.  Boomer is heart worm negative (yay!), in good health but may need to loose just a little weight which is easily obtained by giving him exercise. He is great with other dogs and most likely will be fine with children over the age of eight. As often the case with shelter dogs, Boomer tends to guard his food and one will need to work with him on his resource guarding.  He also does not like loud noises such as sirens.\n\nBoomer weighs 55 lbs but thinks he is a lap dog. He walks well on a leash and we think he is about 2-3 years old. He is neutered, has his vaccines and is ready to go to his forever home.\n\n***Please note that we are a volunteer run organization, and due to the large volume of applications, inquiries, phone calls, emails, and messages received we may not be able to provide a detailed, personal response to every single one. For that reason, formal applications will be given priority over the aforementioned.***\n\nAdoption Process\n1. Submit Application\n2. Interview\n3. Home Check\n4. Meet the Pet\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies 6 months and under is $225; this includes the spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, and current vaccinations as of the date of adoption.",

You know I was a little shy at first with the deputies, but I realized they were just trying to help me and get me off the streets.  I have settled in nicely in my big dog run! I wag my tail whenever the food dishes come out! And I like to snooze on my nice comfy bed at night! I love to go out with the volunteers. We go for walks and sometimes have playtime in the yard!  While I have been here I have gotten all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered.  If you come to visit with me, I may be a little shy at first.  Just give me a \u201cminute\u201d to warm up and I know you will love me just like the employees and volunteers love me!!",

A good Samaritan brought her to Haywood Emergency Clinic where she was found to be malnourished and suffering from severe ear infections and parasites. A search for an owner got no results and she was transferred to Sarge's. After lots of treatment and TLC, she was able to have her spay surgery. We think she's 8+ years old, so a senior, but that doesn't slow her down! She's an awesome, sweet dog whose tail is always wagging, and she loves her people, especially if there are treats involved. She never messes in her kennel. She is now available for adoption! If you'd like to meet her, please complete the application online at www.sarges.org and we'll be contacting folks to set up appointments.",

I was just out on a stroll looking for some food and a place to rest, when Animal Control pulled up beside me. They asked if I would like a ride to the shelter and by golly I said. \u201cSure!\u201d  I had heard good things about the shelter and wanted to check it out for myself!  Well it turns out the shelter had a nice clean dog run, a big bowl of food, and a comfy bed waiting for me!  Ahhhhhh\u2026\u2026What a relief! I was so tired to looking for food and a warm dry place to spend the night! I am now up for adoption! The shelter checked me out and they gave me all of my vaccinations, they checked me for heartworms and I was negative, they gave me a microchip, and they made sure I was neutered. I am a five-year-old boxer mix.  I have my paws crossed that I will have a new home soon!  Gee, I can\u2019t wait to love a family again!!\n",

I know what you are saying\u2026.. \u201cwhat a cute little dog!\u201d  I guess you are wondering why a cute little dog like me is sitting at the shelter. Animal Control picked me up and my owner signed me over because he just couldn\u2019t take care of me.  The shelter is doing a great job getting me ready for adoption. They gave me all of my vaccinations, they tested me for heartworms and I was negative, they gave me a microchip, and they had me neutered.  On my medical check up they discovered that I had a calcium deficiency so I am getting extra supplements of calcium everyday! I am a one-year-old terrier mix.  One of the volunteers took me outside today and she said I was all \u201clove and snuggles!\u201d",

Finally some one noticed me and decided I needed some help!  My kind rescuer kept me at his house while he looked for my family! He checked with his neighbors to make sure I didn\u2019t belong to one of them. He put out flyers and checked with the shelter too! No one had reported me missing. Finally he decided to go ahead and bring me to the shelter. He knew if my family didn\u2019t claim me, I would have a good chance of finding a new home through the efforts of the shelter.  Anyway I am all fixed up and ready to meet new folks! I am a terrier mix that is about a year old.  I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been spayed.  Now one thing they have noticed about me is that I am a high-energy girl! I know I will do best in an active family that likes to run, jog, hike, play ball, and anything else that requires lots of energy! Do you think you can keep up with me?",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Shiitake! I'm estimated to be a Mastiff mix born 9/25/2020. I came up to Wisconsin from Texas. I am a happy and playful little girl! Obedience classes for adult dogs and puppies can be incredibly helpful for both animals and humans. It helps you understand what makes me tick and will give me a better idea of what you want me to do. It\u2019s a win/win and it will also strengthen the bond between us! Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $350.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

Her babies are grown up and she is ready to find her forever family. She enjoys playing with other dogs and running in the yard. Phoenix tends to lose the concept of humans personal bubble so if you want a snuggle buddy, she's your girl. She does like to chew, but has done great with chewing on only her toys and not other items. Phoenix does know her basic commands and is crate trained and potty trained.\n\nPhoenix's adoption fee is $225.00 which includes 3 rounds of shots, spay, microchip and 1 month of heartworm preventative.

WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE ENTIRE PROFILE FOR ADOPTION INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE APPLY. \n*****************\n\nMeet Buddy. This pup is almost 12 weeks old. He is a shep/husky mix and weighs about 20 lbs. He is very sweet. He loves humans and dogs. Crate trained. Smart. Loving. We are looking for a home with a fenced yard or active adopter because he loves to run around and play and will be a large dog fully grown. \n\nHe was rescued after being abandoned in Puerto Rico with her litter mates. He is available for adoption in Northern Virginia/DC/MD. We currently cannot do home visits in light of Covid-19 risks, so no homes with cats please since we cannot test whether they get along. \n\nPlease apply at www.Project-SecondChance.org. Our adoption fee is $500. Review our adoption procedures on our website BEFORE reaching out to us. Check us out on Facebook or Instagram for more information about our rescues. \n\nFB: @projectsecondchanceforsatos\nIG: project_second_chance\n\nIn lieu of an application fee, this rescue is participating in a support local campaign and asking that you shop at a local business in Alexandria VA to show community support. We believe that helping local small businesses through the pandemic is important. We kindly ask that you attach a receipt for $25 or more spent at: \n\n- The Dog Park, 705 King St, Alexandria, VA 22314. You can also purchase a gift certificate by phone at 703.888.2818. You can also be twice as giving and designate the $25 for the PSC rescue food fund at the store. \n\n- Hops N Shine, 3410 Mt Vernon Ave, Alexandria VA 22305, www.hopsnshine.com\n\n-PSC Etsy Store: https://www.etsy.com/shop/ProjectSecondChance\n\n- Olde Towne School for Dogs, https://www.otsfd.com\n\n- Brut Champagne & Wine Bar, https://www.brutwinebarva.com\n\nWe love our community!

WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE ENTIRE PROFILE FOR ADOPTION INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE APPLY. \n*****************\n\nMeet Cindy Lou. This pup is almost 12 weeks old. She is a shep mix and weighs about 14 lbs. She is very sweet. She loves humans and dogs. Crate trained. Smart. Loving. We will be looking for a home with a fenced yard or active adopter because she loves to run around and play. \n\nShe was rescued after being abandoned in Puerto Rico with her litter mates. She is available for adoption in Northern Virginia/DC/MD. We currently cannot do home visits in light of Covid-19 risks, so no homes with cats please since we cannot test whether they get along. \n\nPlease apply at www.Project-SecondChance.org. Our adoption fee is $500. Review our adoption procedures on our website BEFORE reaching out to us. Check us out on Facebook or Instagram for more information about our rescues. \n\nFB: @projectsecondchanceforsatos\nIG: project_second_chance\n\nIn lieu of an application fee, this rescue is participating in a support local campaign and asking that you shop at a local business in Alexandria VA to show community support.

This litter came to us after their mama got hit by a car :-( they needed to be kept safe! They are little chihuahua mixes, just over 3 months old.\n\nThe puppies are full of life! There is never a dull moment with 6 puppies running around! They are very playful, sometimes rough but always ready for cuddles with their foster family. They live with other dogs of various sizes in their foster home and do well with everyone. They like the house cats too! Although they have not been exposed to kids while in rescue, we do not believe there will be an issue as long as the kids are kind and respectful of their small statures. Housetraining is still a skill in need of work - right now they use pee pads. One or two will venture outside into the snow but then quickly hightail it back inside! They love toys and chewies are a favorite. They are gated or penned at night and when their foster family is gone for the day. They still need training and that\n\nRocky is another little boy looking to get into trouble any way possible! He loves to start trouble with the older dogs in his foster home and when corrected, runs crying to his foster mom! She knows his game now. He loves to play with his siblings and loves to steal toys. If you feel something nibbling on your toes - it's Rocky! He just wants to be loved - how can you say no to him?\n\nRocky is scheduled to be vetted on Feb 2 but we are accepting applications now. He will be neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated at the time. His adoption fee is $400",

She is a very sweet girl that does like to use her voice to tell you about the events of her day. She walks well on leash and appears to be crate/house trained. She has done with other dogs but a meet and greet is always suggested if you have other dogs in the home. She has never been around cats before so that would be a new experience for her. Piper's adoption fee is $125 which includes her spay, rabies, microchip, basic boosters, and heartworm test. If you are interested in meeting Piper, please submit an adoption application located here: https://rockwalladoptions.com/adoptfoster/adoption-application/.All animals unless otherwise noted in their descriptions are at 1825 Airport Road, Rockwall, TX. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday 9 AM - 6 PM and Saturday 9 AM - 5 PM.

She was rescued by the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society from a Texas animal shelter.\n\nChica is a sweet, friendly girl who gets along with everyone she meets. She likes to burrow under blankets and snuggle with you. Nothing makes her happier than being close to you. She is house and crate trained.\n\nChica will thrive in an adult only home. She needs a family who will treasure her the rest of her life. Please complete an Adoption Application. She is only available for adoption in OR and WA.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee:\n$450\n. (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

Jester\u2019s eyes tell us a story we already know. Pain. Fear. Inhumanity. It\u2019s a story we can\u2019t, we don\u2019t want to unsee. Whether large or small, these dogs\u2019 eyes beg us for what they\u2019ve never before had \u2014 love, compassion, understanding, and respect. Jester doesn\u2019t know why he was in the shelter. He had a family once, but no more. Shelter life for this handsome lad only added insult to injury. The chaos, the instability, the constant new faces...it was all just too much for Jester. As a result, he did the only thing he knew to survive. He growled, showed his teeth, and never quite allowed himself to trust anyone. There were some with whom he occasionally engaged, but almost always with trepidation. It was clear they needed to find a rescue, and we were more than happy to bring Jester into the Perfect Pet Rescue family. He weighs 18 pounds and is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines. We are now working with Jester and hope to find a home with an experienced dog owner who will join him on his journey and promise to support and guide him as he heals.\n\nTo see our other dogs, please visit www.perfectpetrescue.com.",

            "description": "Vienna is a 10 week old, female lab mix who weighs about 12 pounds and has a short, shiny black coat with some white markings on her nose, chin, tummy and paws.  We expect she will be 50-65 lbs when fully grown. Vienna is a delightful, playful, smart dog!  She very quickly adapted to her foster home, sleeps through the night and enjoys napping in between play sessions.  She is crate trained and loves to play with children and run around outside (although the current cold temperatures require a little cajoling to get outdoors).  She is learning to play fetch and basic commands (sit and come).  A typical puppy, she loves to chew anything she can get her mouth on.  She is quickly learning to toilet outdoors but is also trained to use wee-pads inside.\n\nVienna has a happy, laid-back personality and would be happy in a house with kids and/or other dogs.  A fenced-in yard or family that will take her on frequent walks would be ideal.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

While this little guy initially approaches new people and situations cautiously, his curiosity soon gets the better of him, and he will enthusiastically join in on all the fun.  Dublin is a sweet natured and playful puppy who loves his toys and balls and has become quite accomplished at fetch. He is doing well with crate and potty training, and if he can't make it outside in time, he will find the nearest wee wee pad to do his business. \n\nDublin's foster family tells us that he is happiest when he is with his people. He is eager to go out and learn about the world and is always up for an adventure, whether it be a ride in the car or a nice long walk on his leash. Dublin is full of silly puppy energy, but once play time is done he is very happy to snuggle on the couch with you for a good belly rub and a nap. He is a people pleaser and highly motivated to learn good manners and appropriate behaviors. Affectionate and loving, Dublin is a handsome dog who will always bring a smile to your face.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org).

            "description": "Spunky Sadie is a 2 year old, 40 pound Beagle/Hound mix, who is sweet as sugar! Sadie is super friendly and wants to be everyone's best buddy.  She loves getting out on long walks and meeting new people and other dogs, and is working very hard on her leash skills. She is also learning to enjoy car rides as she now understands that there will be something fun to do at the end of the trip. \n\nSadie is house trained and well behaved in the home. Alert and curious, she always wants to know what goodies and new adventures are hidden behind a gate or just out of reach on a counter. She is playful and enjoys her toys, but doesn't show any interest in fetching sticks. Sadie is not fond of her crate and much prefers a nice soft dog bed near her people. Her appetite is good and she is currently eating three meals a day in her foster home to gain some much needed weight. Sadie would do well in a home with a fenced in yard where she would be able to safely explore her surroundings. She is great with other dogs and children, although she is very strong and may be better with older children who can understand and encourage her enthusiastic nature. Sadie will be a wonderful addition to an active family - could it be yours?\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",
