            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.None of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com.\n\nTo fill out an application, please visit http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption .\n\n9/28/20 12:48 PM",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nPersonality: Nellie came to us completely matted and just a mess. The wooly coat requires much more grooming so she will need a home that understands that and gets her to the groomer. She is somewhat tolerant of brushing for short periods but if you try too long, she will snap at you. She is a happy, bouncy girl but can be the laziest sun bather and napper. She is cute as a button and will follow her people around but she does have a snappy side to her as well. She is startled by quick approaches and does not like to be led by her collar. You can leash her up just fine but she is untrusting if you try to lead her anywhere by her collar. She will put the brakes on and try to get away from you. Shortly after she came to us, she started having seizures. Her bloodwork is fine but her seizures lasted 4 plus minutes so she is now on phenobarb. She has not had another seizure since she has been on meds.\n\nEnergy Level: Low to Medium\n\nGood with Dogs: Yes but only engages with a handful of dogs in her foster home.\n\nGood with Children: Nellie can be a bit snappy sometimes so she will be best in a home with children 13 or older. She sometimes is freaked out by fast movements and might be anxious with young children and their exuberance.\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats.

Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.

This 3 year old girl was part of a cruelty case that another rescue was helping in. The other rescue was not able to help Maggie Mae overcome some of her handling and fear issues and asked our rescue to see what we could do. Maggie Mae has bonded with her foster dad very very well and will let him do any handling he wants with her but now we are working on desensitizing her with everyone also in the world. Maggie Mae is sweet as pie and deserves a chance to overcome her issues that are a direct result of her former life. Please consider sponsoring Maggie during her recovery time. Please email office@rainbowrescues.org to set up a one time donation or monthly help for Maggie May's care. Thank you. 2/2/21 5:13 AM",

Our TLC club members receive special follow-up help when adopted into their new home including visits with a professional behaviorist. Speak to our volunteers about more information regarding our TLC members.****7 year old female, chi mix. black with white, no kids, okay with some dogs, basics of potty training. Needs fenced in yard and no apartments.Anndalina came to us as an emergency surrender. This poor girl was trying to chew her tail off and needed emergency treatment. We rushed her into our vet and it was determined her tail would need to be amputated to prevent any infection from spreading. This poor nervous girl was whisked into surgery and brought back to one of our foster homes. Anndalina has had a rough beginning to her life and she will need a patient and understanding home to help her become the dog we know she can be. We would recommend she go to a child free home and a home where her Chihuahua bark will not be a problem. A nice quiet couple or single person would be the ideal place for her as she can become overwhelmed with too many visitors. Once she bonds to her people she is very affectionate but it will take a while for this nervous girl to settle into any new home and she will need to be given time to calm and adjust. NEEDS A FENCED IN YARDPlease note we do not have a central kennel facility, all of our pets are located in foster homes. The first step in meeting one of our furry friends is to fill out an application on our website at <a href=''www.rainbowrescues.org''>www.rainbowrescues.org</a>. A volunteer will be in contact with you in 1-2 business days to review your application and speak with you about the adoption process. Our adoption fees at this time are $250 for Adult dogs, $300 for puppies (6 months and under), $100 for senior dogs, $100 for cats, and a $50 fee for small animals. **Please be aware that we are not responsible for inaccurate information on some cross-posted sites such as inaccurate adoption fees and inaccurate pet info.**",

            "description": "Thank you, for caring enough to consider adopting a rescued pup in need of love, respect and a warm place to lay it's head fur-ever.\n\nThis pup is in and will remain in foster care in Rutherfordton, NC until their adoptive person/family has been approved, and will then be ready for transport on the following Saturday(Saturday delivery ONLY).\n\nUpon request, we will be happy to send you more videos and pictures of this pup interacting with her H4S buddies, to help you get a better understanding\n\nof their personality and activity level, and how they interact with their people and other pups.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CESAR(dob:10/26/2009 + weighs 40lbs)\n\nwas originally rescued from Rutherford County, NC's high-kill Animal Control\n\n(on 12/28/2011)\n\nby a long-time animal advocate + volunteer, who passed away leaving 14 dogs behind. Howlin4Spirit stepped up and took in 3 of her precious ones. CESAR was outside in a fenced-in area with\n\nSnookie,\n\na very sweet overweight female RottieX, whom he had the pleasure of keeping company and helped protect Miss Pat(single senior) from anyone trying to come onto her property while walking to shop at Walmart. Cesar is neither scary nor aggressive, in any way. But, would prefer to be the only pup, or needs to be fed separately...we can only assume that Snookie was a big eater and may have been a little 'piggie' and so Cesar is used to having to secure his own bowl. In every other way, they made a good team. He gets along well with Howlin4Spirit's friendly and spirited 45+ dogs running freely on 5+ fenced-in acres, daily. He is a DEVOTED COMPANION, when his nose isn't glued to the ground. NOT to be mistaken for a 'yard ornament' nor laundry room occupant! He LOVES to be with his person, eat, sleep and follow his person around while doing all outdoor chores, laundry, cooking, following his nose to seek out critters, taking walks in the woods, etc. He gets along well with other dogs and cats, but prefers being one of 1, 2 or 3, at most. He needs his person to take time to love on him, sit quietly with him in the woods on their morning walks and on the couch in the evenings. He will be by your side the entire way!\n\nEXTREMELY HAPPY disposition, DEVOTED to his person, and LOVES the outdoors!\n\nHe would NOT do well in an apartment, as he is typical beagle and an avid hunter/explorer.\n\nTherefore, we are seeking to rehome Cesar in a home with a secured fenced-in yard\n\n. We will not be accepting any applications where there are children under the age of 10yo living in the home.\n\nWe are SEEKING to place Cesar, PREFERABLY, in a home with an active retiree OR work-from-home MAN OR WOMAN 45>60yo. CESAR is 11yo and deserves a devoted person who will be there for him, who is able to fill his life with love, respect and companionship, NOT just someone to come home to when the work day or when party is over. HE DESERVES MUCH MORE than the precarious situation he was rescued from!\n\nAdoption fee: $95 include neuter, micro-chip, Parvo-Distemper-Lepto & Bordatella and 3yr Rabies vaccination, parasite-\nfree, current on monthly heart worm and flea/tick prevention, Martingale collar and 6' leash & current health certificate (issued within 4days prior to transport).\n\nWhere there is a scent hound or guardian breed being considered for adoption, & in homes where older respectful children reside or will be visiting, a secured(not electric) fenced-in yard is required.\n\nAll potential adopters are required to be at least 25 yrs old and complete the application below, at your earliest convenience, to help secure the\n\npup of your choice.\n\nUpon receipt of your application, we will acknowledge your application in an email and immediately send out a questionnaire to your 3 personal references.\n\nTo help your chances of adopting the pup of your 1st choice, be sure to contact/ask all references to reply at their most earliest convenience. Also, give your vet's office permission to release your information to Howlin4Spirit. We will be contacting everyone within 2 business days.\n\nUpon approval of this adoption, & to hold the dog/pup of your choice, we require the pup's adoption fee to be sent to our secure PayPal.com acct at: howlin4spirit@gmail.com\n\nUpon receipt of the adoption fee, we will send you the adoption contract and all pertinent information you will need to be ready for your pup's arrival, and reserve your pup's space on LIFESAVERS Rescued Pet Transport's next available transport(SATURDAY delivery ONLY). Their transport fee is $125\n\nto all points as far N as Vince Lombardi svc plaza/NJTnpk mm115,\n\nand $140 to all points N of NYC as far as BurlingtonVT & Albany, NY, to be paid by the adopter to the transport service.\n\n1/1/21 1:01 PM",

            "description": "Thank you, for caring enough to consider adopting a rescued pup in need of love, respect and a warm place to lay it's head fur-ever.\n\nThis pup is in and will remain in foster care in Rutherfordton, NC until their adoptive person/family has been approved, and will then be ready for transport on the following Saturday(Saturday delivery ONLY).\n\nUpon request, we will be happy to send you more videos and pictures of this pup interacting with her H4S buddies, to help you get a better understanding\n\nof their personality and activity level, and how they interact with their people and other pups.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CESAR(dob:10/26/2009 + weighs 40lbs)\n\nwas originally rescued from Rutherford County, NC's high-kill Animal Control\n\n(on 12/28/2011)\n\nby a long-time animal advocate + volunteer, who passed away leaving 14 dogs behind. Howlin4Spirit stepped up and took in 3 of her precious ones. CESAR was outside in a fenced-in area with\n\nSnookie,\n\na very sweet overweight female RottieX, whom he had the pleasure of keeping company and helped protect Miss Pat(single senior) from anyone trying to come onto her property while walking to shop at Walmart. Cesar is neither scary nor aggressive, in any way. But, would prefer to be the only pup, or needs to be fed separately...we can only assume that Snookie was a big eater and may have been a little 'piggie' and so Cesar is used to having to secure his own bowl. In every other way, they made a good team. He gets along well with Howlin4Spirit's friendly and spirited 45+ dogs running freely on 5+ fenced-in acres, daily. He is a DEVOTED COMPANION, when his nose isn't glued to the ground. NOT to be mistaken for a 'yard ornament' nor laundry room occupant! He LOVES to be with his person, eat, sleep and follow his person around while doing all outdoor chores, laundry, cooking, following his nose to seek out critters, taking walks in the woods, etc. He gets along well with other dogs and cats, but prefers being one of 1, 2 or 3, at most. He needs his person to take time to love on him, sit quietly with him in the woods on their morning walks and on the couch in the evenings. He will be by your side the entire way!\n\nEXTREMELY HAPPY disposition, DEVOTED to his person, and LOVES the outdoors!\n\nHe would NOT do well in an apartment, as he is typical beagle and an avid hunter/explorer.\n\nTherefore, we are seeking to rehome Cesar in a home with a secured fenced-in yard\n\n. We will not be accepting any applications where there are children under the age of 10yo living in the home.\n\nWe are SEEKING to place Cesar, PREFERABLY, in a home with an active retiree OR work-from-home MAN OR WOMAN 45>60yo. CESAR is 11yo and deserves a devoted person who will be there for him, who is able to fill his life with love, respect and companionship, NOT just someone to come home to when the work day or when party is over. HE DESERVES MUCH MORE than the precarious situation he was rescued from!\n\nAdoption fee: $95 include neuter, micro-chip, Parvo-Distemper-Lepto & Bordatella and 3yr Rabies vaccination, parasite-\nfree, current on monthly heart worm and flea/tick prevention, Martingale collar and 6' leash & current health certificate (issued within 4days prior to transport).\n\nWhere there is a scent hound or guardian breed being considered for adoption, & in homes where older respectful children reside or will be visiting, a secured(not electric) fenced-in yard is required.\n\nAll potential adopters are required to be at least 25 yrs old and complete the application below, at your earliest convenience, to help secure the\n\npup of your choice.\n\nUpon receipt of your application, we will acknowledge your application in an email and immediately send out a questionnaire to your 3 personal references.\n\nTo help your chances of adopting the pup of your 1st choice, be sure to contact/ask all references to reply at their most earliest convenience. Also, give your vet's office permission to release your information to Howlin4Spirit. We will be contacting everyone within 2 business days.\n\nUpon approval of this adoption, & to hold the dog/pup of your choice, we require the pup's adoption fee to be sent to our secure PayPal.com acct at: howlin4spirit@gmail.com\n\nUpon receipt of the adoption fee, we will send you the adoption contract and all pertinent information you will need to be ready for your pup's arrival, and reserve your pup's space on LIFESAVERS Rescued Pet Transport's next available transport(SATURDAY delivery ONLY). Their transport fee is $125\n\nto all points as far N as Vince Lombardi svc plaza/NJTnpk mm115,\n\nand $140 to all points N of NYC as far as BurlingtonVT & Albany, NY, to be paid by the adopter to the transport service.\n\n1/1/21 1:01 PM",

I am crate and house trained and will take food gently from your finger tips. I love to play, and chasing balls is my favorite activity. I like it inside and outside the house. I will lay in the sun then wait patiently at the door for my owner to let me in. I love to relax with my nose touching my owner. I'm still a little young and goofy. I like people and other dogs.\n\nTeddy is an American Staffordshire Terrier mix, weighs approx 70 pounds, has an estimated DOB of 6/2013.  He is neutered, microchipped, HW negative, kept on monthly Heart Worm and Flea Prevents, and is up to date on his vaccinations.\n\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit our website at www.youluckydogrescue.org and read our Adoption FAQ's and Before You Adopt documents. In addition you can complete an online adoption application from our website. You can also email info@youluckydogrescue.org for additional details.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay  or neuter and microchipping.  The breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog.  We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue.  We are located in the metro Atlanta area.   We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.",

Their personalities emerge after being with us for a bit and sometimes change. The personality and other information included in the above description is based on what we know currently in the shelter environment. All dogs are up to date on vaccines (Distemper, Rabies, Bordetella), microchipped, spayed/neutered and receive worming, flea & tick medication before they are adopted out. Please note there are some exceptions depending on the condition of the dog. If you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application at https://www.camppapillon.org/dog-application.\n\nOnce your dog is in your home, they will adjust and relax and could become more playful or show more personality traits as they begin to open up. Once adopted, please allow your dog time to decompress and relax in a stable home environment.",

He is bred merle to merle, resulting in deafness.\nHe's a handsome and unique looking boy who is affectionate, loves to sit for cookies. He hails from the Apple Valley shelter, picked up as a stray. He's very affectionate, and he's a pretty gentle boy. He has a unique temperament. Eddie's kind of on his own planet. We find his quirkiness to be really endearing and he's grateful for every minute of attention. He's an unshakably happy and calm boy.\nEddie came from the shelter with a rash that turned out to be a nasty staph infection. It spread like wildfire and he lost most of his coat. The infection is finally gone after treating it several times, leaving Eddie with a thin coat. He takes a very inexpensive supplement to help with his coat.\nTo meet Eddie, please complete our on-line adoption application:\nhttp://www.deafdogrescueofamerica.org/adoption-application.html\n\nPlease note that we are unable to respond to inquiries, emails or phone calls. Our adoption process starts with completion/submission of an application for adoption. All applications are reviewed as quickly as we can, and our adoption process is not first come, first served. We select our adoptive homes according to what our dogs/puppies require. If you are selected as an appropriate match, you will be contacted to set an appointment to visit the Ranch and meet Eddie.",

Nimby is even smarter than he is good looking. He will form a very heavy bond, and needs an active guardian that will make sure he gets enough exercise and mental stimulation. He'd make a great agility dog, or competitive obedience dog.\nWe think that Nimby would do best in a house with a yard rather than an apartment.\nIf you are looking for a dog to join you on your adventures, and would like to meet Nimbus, please fill out our on-line adoption application:\nhttp://www.deafdogrescueofamerica.org/adoption-application.html\nPlease note that we are unable to respond to inquiries, emails or phone calls.

My new family (A.S.K.) saved me at the request of my former family who had bailed. They gave me a chance even though I had a \"grumpy dog\" face on a lot. I was just scared, and missing my Dad. \n\nI have learned to believe in the power of kind people! All people are good people. I don't love sharing people with other dogs though. I can do it, but I am be a little bossy over my food or toys. I would be happiest as a single dog. I have average energy level and am used to going with the flow. I walk well and am house-trained. \n\nI have one \"issue\" that they say makes me \"special needs.\" My skin is sensitive. I have to be managed on steroids or another drug lifelong. It's not a big deal. My people say it's affordable, and I'm worth it. A.S.K. can tell you more. \n\nPlease come meet me in Battle Creek, Michigan! I deserve to finally find love again! \n\nPlease private message us at www.facebook.com/allspecieskinship for questions!

            "description": "Baci is the dog companion for the outdoor enthusiast who prefers hikes or jogs instead of walks or for the person who looks for a reason to be outside in the garden or yard in any season.  Baci is a 17 month, 32 lb. short hair neutered male who is housebroken, crate trained, microchipped and up to date on all vaccinations.  He was rescued as a young puppy from Puerto Rico and selected for our hearing dog program.  Baci is an extremely quick learner and has a drive/need to be busy with ball retrieving, a frisbee toss or just being a constant, attentive companion.  He rates the highest score on our intelligence scale however, unfortunately, he is too active for the passive behaviors required of an assistance dog.  He is not the laid back family dog personality that is usually the description of our release dogs.  Baci is extremely loyal and bonds strongly to those he trusts.  He may bark or be aloof to strangers which may appear to be protective, but a dog treat or ball toss wins him over quickly.\nBaci has won our hearts with his loyalty and zest for life.  He is so special in his own unique way.  His adoption fee is $400.00. If interested, please email Sue Berry at sberry@neads.org (no calls will be accepted).",

FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER STELLA AND CHEWY'S PET FOOD WITH REIMBURSE THE ADOPTION FEE FOR NEW OWNERS OF SENIOR DOGS!\n\nI am a sweet senior guy, I was born November 7, 2012. I love spending time with my foster family and resident dogs, I even like the young foster puppies. I get along with most dogs and would be most happy living with another one. I also require a single family home. NO invisible fences for me! Oh yeah, I like to chase cats. I have a high prey drive, squirrels and bunnies are fun to chase and bark at. Babies and young kids kind of scare me, I need a home without kids younger than 13. \n\nI love to play fetch! Ball is my favorite game. I like to fetch sticks that are tossed in the lake too! I love to snuggle on the couch with my people, that\u2019s my very favorite thing. I am what you call a Velcro dog; wherever my foster mom goes, I follow. \n\nI do have some anxiety. I am on 2 different daily anxiety meds, they are very affordable. I also have prescription dog food for my sensitive digestive tract. This is managed by eating my prescription food and treats with no table scrapes. I get a little nervous when meeting new people. It can take a few minutes and some of my dog food to warm up to people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll also warm up if you throw the ball for me! I have a loud bark, that sometimes scares people, it\u2019s just how I bark. I don\u2019t want to scare anyone, I just get so excited!  \n\nAdoption fee is $425 plus tax. Please email us at info@actvrescue.org. Inquiries with in 1 hour of downtown Minneapolis. Looking forward to hearing from you!\n",

He is in excellent shape, has all his shots, is neutered, and is heartworm negative, He has perfect energy, playful, but not hyper. He loves to hang out with us, next to one of our shih-tzus, and fall asleep with his head on our lap. While he loves to chill, he also loves to hike and play with other dogs; he loves meeting new dogs! He is fine with cats. He is totally housebroken, sits on command, and is very gentle when taking a treat. Max is a total sweetheart and adores everyone. If you are looking for that sweet, loving dog, Max is the dog for you! Please call Sindee at 914-299-3700.",

This girl and her 7 puppies were scheduled for euthanasia but her fast acting foster quickly scooped them up to save their lives in the shelter.  All her puppies got adopted over 3 year ago and Arabella waits.  \nArabella is not a fan of other dogs or cats. She wants all the attention to herself. She would be better with children over the age of 10 years. She is cute as a button and just wants someone to snuggle with. Oh and did I tell you she loves toys, tennis balls and Kongs!  She also has the cutest wiggle dance if you scratch her back or back legs, be sure to ask to see that if you meet her!  \nAdoption Fee: $125",

Any considerations for Duke\u2019s adoption are due to his big heart and great love for his people.  He needs a tall fence as he will jump a short one to fulfill his desire to be with you.  He is best as an only dog since he enjoys attention so much he doesn\u2019t want to share.  Duke is as sweet as can be, he rides very well in a car, enjoys belly rubs, and is a mellow man just wanting to be with you.  He loves and bonds quickly to his family but does NOT welcome outsiders.  Duke will reward his owner with lots of love and companionship.\n\n\nSee www.halah.org for more information and photos. Visit us on www.facebook.com/Home.At.Last.Animal.Haven",

Could it be you?\nHere\u2019s my stats:\nPossible Breed: Maybe Lhasa Apso and Shih Tzu\nGender:  I\u2019m a boy \nColors: White with a little light brown\nAge:  I\u2019m about 8 ears old\nWeight: about 24 pounds\nMy Perfect home: I would prefer to be an only dog.\n\nNow for the good stuff!-\nI am an independent boy.  When outside with other dogs I like to stand on the side lines and watch them play.  When I first came to Lone Star, I sometimes showed Lhasa-tude. I would be a little growly/snappy if I didn\u2019t like something. Now I\u2019m getting better and better as I learn new manners from firm but loving people. I would do best in a home with teenagers and above. I don\u2019t have any known medical issues\n\nTo start the process of adopting me or one of the other pups by filling out the application found at www.shihtzu-rescue.com. \nPS. I've had ALL my vetting, and oh boy, it was a lot. Here's what I had done:\nDistemper/Parvo shots \u2013 TWICE. One shot doesn't cut it.\nBordetella shots - ALSO TWICE. \nSpay/Neuter-of course.\nA fecal exam so I don't have any bad worms. Treatment if I do.\nA heartworm test. Treatment if I am positive for heart worms\nBLOODWORK to make sure my liver and kidneys are working well, because you know, we doggies often have issues in the liver and kidneys.\nA DENTAL exam AND cleaning if I needed it- yep, all my toofies are checked out.\nSee, that's a LOT. Ask your vet - that's a LOT.\n\n",

He would do best in a home with no children under the age of 18.\n\nHe had a home but his love was not enough to keep his owner from leaving him behind when she moved.\n\nNow he goes to doggie daycare everyday and waits for someone to pick him up at night to take him home.\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FROM OUR WEBSITE: www.hoperescues.com.

But then they dumped her at a high kill shelter in NYC. She was on death row and terrified.\n\nWhat Bailey didn't know was that she had a Guardian Angel watching over her. This angel went and got her from NYC - he had to save this poor girl. He contacted us and we agreed that we had to help her!\n\nBailey is an itty bitty Boston pitty - she's super fun and also a HUGE snuggler. Bailey loves people more than anything. She just wants to be close and feel their touch.\n\nBailey cannot live with dogs or small children (they make her very nervous). She chases cats but can live with them. There is a catch-- she needs very slow introductions over a period of time (using gates for separation and no contact unless cat or Bailey is crated so they can sniff but also be safe while doing so) This enables her to get to know the cat just like people get to know each other! It can take anywhere from 1-2 months, but then she is fine and will even snuggle with a kitty!\n\nThis girl needs a calm, stable environment. Bailey's ideal family will be active, able to handle her high energy and administer structure to help her be her best. She has anxiety so being active will truly help with that and it will allow her people to bond with her.\n\nPlease submit an application if you are interested in her. Bailey is a perfect addition to any home!\n\n**Beauty of Bailey captured by Marlee and Me 716**\n\n**Bailey's adoption fee has been sponsored by a generous volunteer**\n\n**Please note we do not adopt to Canada due to border issues and breed specific legislation.Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

He is a very effectionate boy, listens very well to commands, is eager to please his humans and does get along with calm submissive dogs. Gatsby is a very happy guy who loves to run, carry around his toys and play fetch with a ball. Oh let me re-phrase that, he is a ball fanatic!Gatsby enjoys being in the company of his 'humans' and really enjoys extended cuddle sessions on the couch.\nGatsby is house and crate trained and rides very well in the car.\nGatsby is a little bit too interested in cats, so we recommend a home without them. Gatsby is walking nicely on the leash but will get excited when he sees other dogs during walks which should be easily controlled with some professional training. Gatsby does guard his food and is used to eat his meals in his crate without a problem. He automatically runs into his crate when it is feeding time, sits and waits until it is his turn. Due to his size and energy level we recommend children 6 and up. Please consider giving this gorgeous golden-eyed boy a forever home. He has been waiting for so long and deserves a chance.\n2/2/21 5:06 PM",

            "description": "Meet KOBE! He is a 5 year old Mastiff/Staffordshire terrier mix.  We rescued Kobe from the South LA Shelter over three years ago and he has been waiting for the right person to come along and take him home. \n\nKobe is very strong, but gentle and sweet as well. Due to his size and strength we believe he would do well with an experienced dog owner with strong leadership skills and be an only dog. He is looking to please that \"one and only\" human. Kobe knows basic commands and walks very well on leash...unless he sees a cat or small dog. Because of this we think we would do best in a home vs apartment setting.  If you adopt Kobe, he comes with 6 months of weekly training sessions at our kennel plus two weeks of boarding. \n\nKobe has worked on and off with obedience training and one of his trainers said \"I've been working with Kobe for a few months now, and he is always happy to see me and always ready for some fun together. We have been working on leash manners and he does very nicely (unless there is a stray cat lurking about and we have been working on leaving those alone too.) Kobe enjoys going to the park and watching all of the kids, bikes, dogs and horses that go by with ease. He knows all of his commands like; sit, down, stay, focus, and is working on rollover! He's easy to get in and out of the car and is an excellent passenger. I really can't say enough great things about this big hunk, he has the looks and the personality and would be a great dog to snuggle with on the couch. Yesterday Kobe worked on walking nicely by distractions, ie bikes, remote cars, drones, horses, goats, dogs, kids playing soccer etc. We worked on down, stay, and learned rollover (which is more rub my belly ?). He was great getting in and out of my car and sat nicely outside Starbucks and had a puppachino with a lot of stuff going on around him.\n\nSEE KOBE DEMONSTRATE HIS TRAINING: https://youtu.be/xOj8fn7o6Cw\n\nIf you are interested in KOBE and live in the LOS ANGELES AREA, please fill out our brief online questionnaire (copy and paste link): www.downtowndogrescue.org/adoption-questionnaire\n\nAdditional Downtown Dog Rescue information email: adopt@downtowndogrescue.org or call: 818-407-4145",

(breeds were recently changed/updated) She was brought to an overcrowded, New Jersey shelter as a stray and Rescue Ridge stepped up to save her. Belle is affectionate, playful, loves to snuggle, and is housebroken. Belle has played with several other dogs and has walked well with them, too. She lived with a small dog and with a young child. She likes most dogs and we would need to see if your dog is a good match. Belle has helped some of the dogs at the rescue adjust to kennel life, including the timid ones. She is a loving, beautiful soul who has been dealt a rough deck and wants a person or family to love her forever. She takes toys, treats, and food gently and is very sweet. Belle walks nicely on a harness and weighs about 60 lbs. Belle would do best in an adult home or one with older children. She would also love a fenced in yard. Come see Belle and apply to adopt her at RescueRidge.com and then you can also text us at 732- 546- 8805 to meet Belle. Here is her latest video playing with Noodle: https://youtu.be/XWfzFhlheZM Here is Belle's recent video: https://youtu.be/gSTyDfb9aJQ Here is another of Belle's recent videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loD6STkL7I4&feature=youtu.be Please watch Belle blossom in her previous video (breeds were changed recently) link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKKTo1OlSEAnd, here is Belle's previous video link:https://youtu.be/BRm_g7cMVvs",

            "description": "I Am One of the Max Collection!Tabitha was born about April 1, 2013 and weighs a bit too much at about 90 lbs. This girl is very proud of her curves and when her favorite human has been gone for a few hours she does the most delightful, bouncy, dance that we've ever seen! She is absolutely adorable and has been very good with all of us, but terribly shy at first. She is good with other dogs, fine in the car and on leash. This gorgeous girl has been tossed away and will be so thankful for a new home where she will be cherished! She was left at a shelter when her babies were two days old, guess she became an inconvenience. She was terrified for herself and her infants when we loaded them up to come here just a couple of days later. She was a very good Mom, surmounted the stress and kept taking care of her babies who grew to be strong and healthy and now she is looking for a new home that will love her unconditionally! It is obvious that Tabitha has not always been treated well by humans and she is terrified of being touched by new humans and she is terrified of new places. She will take much time and effort to adjust to a new life, but she is a really wonderful, loving, girl once comfortable. Due to her fears she truly must have a fenced in yard. Tabitha is too interested in cats to live with any.\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet.\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

Other dogs are not so lucky, have you considered fostering?\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION:\nTake a look at Cricket! This cute gal is looking for a new home...she's super sweet and good with people once she trusts them and other dogs. Cricket will do well with a patient adopter willing to give her time to adjust.\nCricket is a quirky girl, she isn't a super outgoing & she is very shy, but she makes up for it in the most affectionate ways. She must go to a home with another dog. Another dog will show her that people are okay and will show her the ropes of a new home. Cricket has been living in a foster home with a family, multiple dogs and a cat. Cricket is a great couch cuddler and her favorite place is sitting under the table waiting for her tiny human to drop some food! Can you give Cricket a forever home? Email us & talk to her foster mom for more information.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nHelp Save Lives! Make a tax-deductible donation today by clicking on the Donate Button below! Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and we are non-profit, all-volunteer run rescue. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!\nSPONSOR ME!\nPlease donate towards my care and medical expenses here:\nhttp://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ 2/2/21 6:06 PM",

Hope everyone is having a good day. I know I am. My previous life was not that great. I had several litters of puppies and was dumped at a kill shelter. I am a very lucky girl because Make A Difference Rescue saved me. Unfortunately I have been patiently waiting for 3 years for my forever family to find me. The volunteers give me lots of love, but it is not the same as my very own family.\n\nLet me tell you a little more about myself. I am a 6 year old American Bulldog mix. I was found to be heartworm positive and I received treatment. I am now heartworm negative. I do need to have a Heartguard once a month for the rest of my life. NO DOGS OR CATS!! I absolutely love being around people!! I love to play and swim in kiddie pools. I am a champion at taking the stuffing out of toys. I love bones with peanut butter in them too. I would do best with children 10 years old or older. My forever home needs to have a fenced yard where I can safely run and play. I am spayed, on heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. The volunteers cannot believe I have not been adopted yet. Are you my forever family??\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. My adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "Adoption fee on this dog is $300.\n\n\t\tMoses is a Handsome 8 yo Black and Tan male weighing 80 lbs.  He was originally found as a stray when he first arrived to us 3 years ago. While we do not know much about his early past, he was returned to us after living with a family for 3 years due to a change in job location.  As always, Moses remains very social and curious.  Like many dogs, he displays moments of hesitation with some new experiences, however he will eagerly join you with positive and confident leadership.  Due to years of living outdoors, he used to avoid all tile/linoleum floors. Happily, this has been completely overcome.  In fact, Moses finds the indoors to be his preferred sanctuary where he often may entice play even on slippery surfaces.\n\n\t\tThis boy is amazingly game for any activity you have to offer whether a walk in the neighborhood, an adventure in the car, or retrieving a bouncing ball. In fact, his love of balls makes us wonder if he is part Labrador retriever! (Of note, this boy can destroy a bagful of tennis balls in record time. Supervision is necessary to prevent him from getting pieces lodged in his teeth!).  \n\n\t\tMoses has developed excellent house manners.  He sleeps in a roomy crate at night, and is accustomed to staying alone long hours while his foster mom is at work.  He greets all dogs well, both large and small, however he may become rather rough in play.  Supervision and guidance is important while he is around other dogs to manage his arousal.  On occasion, he reverts to an adolescent with bouts of impatience and a grumble protest.  With calm patience and commitment to carry through, he will quickly learn to trust your direction.  Despite bursts of this boyhood rambunctious nature, he is very affectionate with low to medium energy, and rests very well in the home.  While he has enjoyed life with other foster dogs, he will do well as an only dog who can adapt to a wide range of human activity, including the company of calm older children.  \n\nMoses has osteoarthritis [of his elbows, back, and hips], and will require daily inexpensive anti-inflammatory medications. Moses has had bladder stones in the past and at this time is not on a prescription diet which helped to resolve his bladder stones.  Consistent hydration will be important in his daily diet for this reason.  \n\n\t\tCats & small critters unknown.\n\nThis dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

We save dogs from shelters in the south and need foster homes in the north for our dogs until they get adopted. The more foster homes we have, the more dogs we can save! Please consider giving this short term rewarding commitment a try. Foster as often or as little as you'd like. We supply any vet care needed and support to our foster homes, you supply the food and the love. Please contact us today to find out more! Visit our website to complete a foster application www.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.\n\n1/31/21 8:35 AM",

And you just had to read up to find out more about meI'm not surprised, my foster mom tells me all the time how cute I am! So, here is a little bit about me: I'm about 5 years old and I've been with Diamonds in the Ruff for a REALLY long time now. Don't get me wrong, I've been doing great in my foster home, but I'd really like to find my forever home and get settled in. Everyone tells me that it takes longer when you're like me - a black pittie. I don't know why, but that's just the way it is. But I'm not worried, my perfect family is out there.\n\nWhen I dream about my perfect home, I see a quiet place where my humans have a routine that they follow most days. I'm not a big fan of surprises, so routine is good; that way, I know what to expect and what is expected of me. I want to make my humans happy, but they need to be able to tell me what to do and tell me when I'm doing something I'm not supposed to. My perfect family would be made up of older humans. Like I mentioned, I don't like surprises and sometimes young kids are just too much for me to figure out. My favorite things in the whole world are going for walks and going for rides in the car!! It's so much fun to explore! I walk nicely on my leash and I am a perfect gentleman in the car.\n\nI enjoy being around other dogs, but I don't necessarily have to have a furry brother or sister to be happy. I'm quite happy to have all the attention of my humans all to myself. I don't like cats, though. YUCK!\n\nI would like a home where I can get a medium amount of activity. I've gone running with my foster mom and that's fun, but I also like to be lazy and just cuddle up on the couch next to my humans. Of course, I am house-trained, crate-trained, up to date on my shots, and microchipped. Now that you know a little bit more about me, I know you'll want to meet me and get to know me even better! All you have to do is contact Diamonds in the Ruff, fill out an application, and set up a time for us to meet! You know you want to!!\n\n**Please note we do not adopt to Canada due to border issues and breed specific legislation.Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment. 2/2/21 10:16 AM",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nHi, I'm Charlie and I love everybody with 2 legs!Date into Rescue: 5/2/2017\n\nReason for being in rescue: Owner release/health of the owner\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? none needed\nWeight: About 45 lbs\nHeight: est 22\" at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? I need a home with no other smaller animals, and where I can be loved of course!\n\nWhat is my personality like? He is a whole lot of dog. His owner did tell us that he has had problems with other dogs, especially little dogs, so we have not tested him with others nose to nose. This can be done on request but Charlie is so people focused we'd really like to find him a home as an only dog. Note that dogs can walk by his crate all day or he can be with other dogs with a fence between them with no issues at all. Dogs who want to be only dogs are rare. He is an ideal candidate for someone who only wants one dog. Charlie is physically very strong! He pulls on his leash and for some reason has an obsession with the shower in the kennel because if given the chance he runs straight for it. We don't have a pool but I'd love to see this water loving dog doing some hiking where he can splash in the creeks.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 5/3/2014. Charlie doesn't know basic commands but he is learning he has to sit for his treats. I think he will be a fast learner. He would need a fence. He is very friendly with the adults in our kennel but has not been tested with kids. On our walk he kept his nose to the ground and was full speed ahead! He didn't bark when meeting new people and was perfectly okay with them approaching him to love on him.\n\nUPDATE 1/30/2018: Charlie truly lives to please people. His whole world begins and ends with humans. As soon as you walk into the kennel and make eye contact with him his tail immediatly starts to wag and he does his happy dance. This boy is not hard to win over what so ever, and he will surly be after your own heart! Since being here we have learned that Charlie DOES NOT like other dogs. He would prefer to be the only pet. He has learned to sit, to go in his crate, give shakes, and to go straight to the door when being let out. Charlie is easily trainable due to him just wanting to please you. Just like any other young lab he loves tennis balls and really really loves being let out into the bigger field we have, he loves to get his exercise!\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Taylor has a hard time in a cage which is the reason he came to our shelter, as our dogs have little \"kennel\" in comparison to traditional shelters.\n\nHe is protective in his kennel but once he is out of his kennel and running amok in our yard, he is a very sweet pup.  As you can see in the profile pictures & video, he adores playing in the pool.  We hope his new family will have a kiddie pool for him to splash around in.  \n\nWe do not receive much information about Taylor from the transferring shelter.  He appears to do well with other dogs that are calm and friendly towards him.  If you are interested in Taylor and have another dog, please bring your canine family member to the shelter for a meet and greet,\n\nWe have no information on how Taylor gets along with cats.  Do to his unknown history, we do recommend that his adoptive home be one without small children.\n\nThis is a sweet boy who needs an active and loving home.  If you are interested in meeting TAYLOR please contact the shelter, (207) 426-9482 to arrange a time. Leave a voice mail if no answer.",

S.C.M.R. thanks you and so does Napolean.\n\nWe are sorry to say Napoleon is no longer available for adoption.  His diabetes has caused a lot of damage over the years to his little body, and he is now totally blind and deaf.  His quality of life is slowly going away, so we are now giving him hospice care and don't expect him to be with us very much longer.\n\nIf there is anyone that would like to contribute to his hospice care please send to SCMR.\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

            "description": "Jade, now known as Brody, is a beautiful 45 pound, 3.75 -year- old Lab mix.  He was adopted from us as a puppy, but now needs to be rehomed due to his anxiety and the addition of a new baby in the house.\n Brody needs a home with active, dog-experienced owners and no young children or other dogs or cats.  Brody thrives on structure and will need training, exercise, and positive reinforcement.  His family says he is a great dog to have around. This handsome boy enjoys lounging in the sun, cuddling, playing, and car rides; but his favorite activity is going for walks. Brody still has puppy-like qualities, and he loves to run around his fenced yard and play fetch, though a fenced yard isn't mandatory. His original write up is below and the second to the  last picture is of him as a puppy.  If you can give Brody his forever home, please apply today. \nJade's/Brody's  adoption fee is $200.\nAdoption coordinator:  Pam\n\nOriginal write up:\nJade is one of Mia Mya's 9 puppies.  He is a 12-week-old Lab mix puppy.  He and his littermates will be larger than their 28 pound mom Mia Mya, but a bit smaller than a large Lab.  Jade is a gem worth keeping--a rare find.  He meets all your needs--he loves to play and snuggle. And, as I'm sure you can tell from his pictures--he loves the water.   Jade  is working on his house and crate training.  If you can give this adorable guy his forever home, please apply today.  Puppies do best with children 5 and up.  Jade's adoption fee is $450.\n\n\n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

Though we cannot imagine doing something so careless ourselves, we don't understand how this sweet boy could still be the happy guy that he is!  Farley is a smart fellow who loves other dogs his size and gets along great with our volunteers.  Farley is about 4 years old.  He is in good health, up to date with vaccines, and is neutered and microchipped.  Learn how to meet and adopt Farley on our website at www.carerva.com.\n\nCARE Rescue is  foster-base rescue located in Richmond, VA.  We do not have a facility for you to come to meet animals at.  You must visit our weekly adoption stand (calendar on our website) to meet the adoptable dogs.  Out of area adoptions can only be facilitated when we are able to find a volunteer to do a home visit for us and when the potential adopter already has a veterinary reference.",

            "description": "Age: 6 years old (approx)\n\nWeight: 50 pounds\n\nAdoption Fee: $150 (includes microchip, neuter surgery and vaccinations)\n\nPapa is a very friendly medium-sized dog who is sweet and people-oriented. He knows how to SIT, lay down, and SHAKE hands and will even do this with either paw! He is quite playful but also a well-behaved adult dog. He likes car rides and going for puppacinos and frozen yogurt! He loves all people and loves to make new friends! We have also discovered he seems to enjoy wearing hats and sweaters, and he's so photogenic that you cannot help but dress him up for pictures! He's our resident Dog Model who will wear just about anything and has fun too. Got Netflix? He'll binge-watch whatever you're watching with you (we can't guarantee he'll stay awake though!) We have also found that Papa also really likes race tracks! He has been to Virginia International Raceway THREE times and loves all the people and noise.\n\nHis ideal home would have no other dogs (cats who know dogs are OK) and no small children/toddlers (he jumps a little bit when he's excited and could knock a little child over without meaning harm). He likes to run around with balls so a fenced yard is required.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nPapa is available for adoption through Spirit Canine Rescue. To adopt Papa, please visit our website http://www.spiritcaninerescue.org/adopt.html for more information and to complete an application. A home visit will be required prior to adoption. We request that all adopters be within reasonable traveling distance to Burlington NC.\n\n* Our only obligation is to the dogs in our program and we reserve the right to determine whether a particular dog and the adopter are the right fit. Remember, just because a dog \"looks\" like the one you want, that does not necessarily mean that the dog will \"behave\" like the one you want!\n\nNote: We do not adopt out of state! We do not adopt dogs into homes with invisible /underground fencing! 2/1/21 3:43 PM",

The staff didn't realize they were even there until they heard the puppies crying. They found an extremely frightened and guarding Nuri with 5 pups - 3 of whom were already dead.\n\nAs you can see, the 2 surviving pups are now thriving and look to grow into medium to medium-large doggies.\n\nWe are saying their other breed is Bull Terrier (think Spuds Mckenzie) as their mom definitely looks to have some of that in her. They are very playful with each other and are learning, just like their mom, that they can trust humans that will treat them with love and kindness!

We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Ozzie is part of a group of 4 chihuahua's that were given to us from a home with 11 dogs that were never given human attention. They are very fearful of everything. We are working slowly with each of them.Update:Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, lived a very scared and broken-hearted chihuahua. His name was Ozzie. He was taken to boarding until a foster home became available to wish away the memories that scared and scarred him. Within a week, a lady came to pick him up. Ozzie saw the lady and tried to hide in a corner of the boarding facility. The lady took a step closer and Ozzie pooped his pants! (Okay, Ozzie didn't have pants on and it hit the floor. But, we don't want to embarrass him about being naked in public.) The lady spent a long time sitting near him and talking to him before Ozzie would crawl onto her lap. The lady took Ozzie home with her. Ozzie was given his own room with a crate to sleep in. It had a warm fluffy bed. The lady placed him in the crate to adjust to the sounds of the house. Ozzie had never been more scared in his life. Whenever the lady tried to put a leash on his collar he would try to scare her away with snarls and barks, but she wouldn't give up. For 2 weeks the lady would dangle a slip lead through the crate and loop it around him before she could put his leash on. The foster lady had discovered that Ozzie was afraid to have anyone be near his head. Ozzie started to realize that no matter how much he showed his fears, this foster lady wouldn't give up on trying to love him. His foster mom started leaving his crate and bedroom door open. One night he peeked into her bedroom and saw her with two other dogs on her bed. They were playing and licking her face...and she laughed and seemed to like it. Ozzie snuck closer and closer...until he was up on the bed at the bottom, watching as the other dogs moved closer to foster mom and cuddled up to sleep! Foster mom pretended not to notice as Ozzie crept closer and closer...until he came up to her and cuddled too! This went on for several nights. Finally, Ozzie decided that he wasn't so afraid of foster mom and he was going to give her a kiss on the face like the other dogs did. Foster mom was filled with joy. This kiss meant more than any wet puppy kiss she ever had. The scared and broken-hearted chihuahua had turned a corner and found someone he could trust and care for!As the days and weeks turned into months, Ozzie started to try playing with the other dogs. He would sit on foster mom's lap, drink her iced tea and coffee when she wasn't paying attention, and start going up to other members of the household for petting. Ozzie learned nobody was going to hurt his head and all the humans respected his wish to allow him to give kisses first and not reach for his head or put their face in his without first being asked to by him. Life for Ozzie was the best he could remember.Then, one day, foster mom brought home a pup. The pup's name was Dink. Dink was a very energetic and playful puppy. Ozzie wasn't sure why, but foster mom decided to introduce him to Dink in the play yard...just the two of them! Ozzie heard foster mom tell someone she was so happy to finally see him play like a young dog should. Ozzie continued to play with Dink. They ran and ran in the green grass until they were both tired and thirsty. Ozzie thinks he heard foster mom say she hopes he finds a furever home now that his fears have lessened. Ozzie now has joy and hope in his heart that he will soon find another patient and understanding home of humans that he could make as happy as foster mom!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5.

All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Helllloooooow my name is Zeplin. I came from a very scary man and people were really mean to me and other dogs werent very nice either :( I was scared of everything!!! I'm starting to really like my foster mommy but I still run when she calls me. She comes over and takes me out of my crate and holds me and it actually feels really nice but I still don't trust humans enough just to run over and ask for attention like the other pups do.Zeplin will defecate if you try to force interaction. Comfortable with other dogs but not humans.Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Lynn & Cedric (lynnwelcomesyouhome@gmail.com) for more information about this pet. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!MUST HAVE FENCED YARDNO SMALL CHILDRENQUIET HOUSEHOLDSo I'm a little 'crooked' anatomically speaking! I would never morally be 'crooked' its just not in my sweet, angelic character. Now here is my story. I was wandering around the street of Philly now if you have never been there let me tell you there are some SCARY streets and a LOT of homeless pups. I was 'holding my own' but I gotta tell you living on the streets is tough business and I'm just not setup to be 'tough' so between you and I shhhhhh I left myself get caught. They brought me to the shelter and I just hoped for the best. I tried to look really sweet and stand up straight (well as straight as I can) when people came in the room.\nA lady came in and the guy with her said hey this little guy is cute.... The lady said what's wrong with his neck? That's not good we need to take him too!! And the next thing I knew they took me out of the crate and put me in their nice warm car with Princess and the two of us left the scary shelter and city behind and headed for Elizabethtown.\nWhoooohooooo. I stayed at the hospital so they could see if my crooked neck was hurting my spine or anything but Dr. C said it is congenital and it is not compressing my spine so its all good I'm just 'unique' hmmmm I could have told them that and saved us all a lot of time :)\nAvery has been on a few home visits. He is very 'picky' with whom he likes. He is not a dog to go to a home with a lot of activity and he cuddles on his terms :) FENCED YARD REQUIRED Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs.

Well I'm no prissy female anyway so thats OK. I get along with all the other foster dogs in my home I'm not thrilled with humans and I am VERY choosy about whom I will make up to. Please understand I am not a dog that will fit in just any home and definitely not one with children.I came from ACCT Philly. That is a really scary place and my people handed me and Lindsey over and walked away. The guy went to put me in this high cage and dropped me. I fell 4 feet on to the cement floor on my head and had a seziure! It was awful!!! When that happened they took me somewhere else and I didn't see Lindsey again. I was soooo scared I just cuddled in a corner with my face in the corner of the cage and tried to shut out the world. The shelter decided it was time to put me to sleep!! Thank God they put out an email that they were going to euth me and 2nd Chance drove to Philadelphia. When they got there their director said 'where is Logan' the shelter said on the adoption floor. The Director said get her. The shelter worker said I don't know if I can we have her up for adoption. The Director said you either give me both or I take neither (she told me later she was bluffing and would NEVER have left me behind but she knew the shelter would not want to make that decision :) Soooo they went and got Lindsey and I was soooo happy when I saw a familiar face!! These days we are not as close as we have made other friends in the house so our foster mom says we do not need to go together. I am not a cat dog. I like to chase them way to much!! The cat in my house now HATES me.

We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Well let me tell ya about my hard luck story! I was with some not so nice people so this lady came to 'save' me. Hmmmm it didn't take me long to figure out she might have meant well but it was not much better there and those little pesky bugs that you humans call fleas were eating me alive!! Thank goodness the cat in the house got 'frisky' with another cat and found herself 'knocked up' and of course the dad was going to be a dead beat father so the lady of the house called the nice lady that helped her with cats before and she came to take the momma cat with her... Well when she saw me she didn't look very happy with the lady that 'saved' me and made it really clear that the lady wasn't doing right by me! She left but a few days later she came back and took me too YAY!!!! She gave me a really nice warm bath and medicine that made those pesky bugs say 'see ya' and then she put me in this noisy car and I took a trip and then these ladies got me and I took another trip and then I went to a house and played with a bunch of dogs for a day and then this other human came and got me and she said she is my foster mommy and I REALLY like her and now I have a boy who likes me and lets me cuddle with him on the couch and oh yeah I have another dog to hang out with too!! Its really cool and my foster mommy says I can stay until she finds me a really AWESOME forever home! I have a feeling my life is going to stay really good and that makes me really happy :)Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5.

            "description": "My name is TINY TILLIE and I'm a 3y F Tan Brindle Staffordshire Bull Terrier/PitX. I'm the queen of the Itty Bitty Brindle Pitty Committee.  I'm  42 lbs of TRUE LAE!!  - LOVE, AFFECTION AND ENERGY!  I'm sweet and petite, quick on my feet and can run like the wind!! I love running around in the yard, especially when the sprinkler is on. Playing fetch with balls and sticks are the best reward! I love spending time outdoors, camping, swimming, going on long walks and laying in the grass like a frog, soaking up the sun. I walk very well on a leash but sometimes I'll try to play with my leash, but I can be corrected and will happily continue trotting along again. I\u2019m also good running alongside a bike. I\u2019m crate trained and house trained. I love dogs, but because I am a bit of a rough player and can get hyper-aroused; I would be best as a solo dog but I could be with a calm, balanced larger soft breed dog or with a hardy active small breed dog that can roughhouse nicely. Because of my hyperactivity, it's best I go with older, bigger kids. I'm super smart, eager to please and quick  to learn. Some of the things I've mastered:  focusing on my owners when walking, \u201cleave-it\u201d for food scraps/garbage on the ground, \u201csit-stay-heal\u201d play on the sidewalk, and greeting and \"play dead\" - Oh and I can dance!!.  Nothing makes me happier than challenging my brain with structured exercise and discipline/obedience training as I like to push my boundaries. I would do great at AGILITY Training!! What I\u2019m looking for is  an ACTIVE person/couple/family who is willing to put the time and energy into  what I need to be a fully balanced dog.  I have come a very long way in my home and show a lot of promise and am worth the time spent burning off my energy. Please be sure to check out my Instagram @tillielovesyou. I'm the catfish smiling, tiger brindle, flog leg laying darling silly itty bitty pitty you\u2019ve been looking for....  please come meet/adopt me today!!\n\nFor more info/app; please email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

Approx 11 yrs old and 45 lbs, Oliver was originally found as a stray. We believe he is a mix of Pit Bull and Bull Terrier. He is a happy guy who loves life & has a big smile! Oliver will be a good friend and companion. Gets along with a lot of dogs but lacks doggie social skills so is best placed with a tolerant dog - currently Jada is his playmate at our adoption center. Oliver LOVES to play ball, go for hikes & rides in the car. Oliver is neutered, chipped, vaccinated & on HW prevention. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org if you can give this comical guy a home. Adoption $165",

            "description": "TWINKLE TOES is a pit bull and cocker spaniel mix (Embark DNA test confirmed)  6 years young. Twink is healthy and athletic. She is a good jogging partner because she is mindful of a human\u2019s pace and stays connected with her human in public places. She has done well with basic training classes. Even though she was neglected in her early years, she has developed a sense of security during her time at CompAnimals. Volunteers have shown her the great outdoors, and she has made many friends\u2014 including people (of all ages) and multiple species of animals. She rides nicely in the car. Twink is trusting and affectionate with her close friends. CompAnimals volunteers successfully helped her build relationships by taking it gradually. After a few low-pressure meetings, she\u2019s ready to give her heart. Then she displays obvious signs of affection\u2014snuggling, kissing, and play-bowing to let you know she likes you. Volunteers have used food and treats, which Twink loves, to help socialize her. Twink is often playful, even downright funny, but she also settles down nicely for couch potato time. Twink is exceptionally trainable. She enjoys positive guidance and opportunities to use her brain as much as she loves treats. She is so easy in so many ways that we will have to remind her successful adopter that she has never had a \u201cnormal\u201d home or family. She will need a steady hand to help her understand domestic life. For this reason, we want to place her with a relatively small family with a quiet home environment. She may be able to share a home with another pet or two, as long as she is carefully introduced with a gradual transition plan. CompAnimals will give Twink our full support for a successful transition, enlisting professional trainers to help if needed. Follow \"Twinkle Toes the Adoptable Dog\u201d on Facebook. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org prior to setting up a meet-and-greet. Twinkle has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, heartworm tested negative and is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention. Adoption $200.",

            "description": "Please contact Jamesa (roxysrescue@yahoo.com), 713-882-2610 for more information about this pet.Gorgeous guy blended Beagle, American Stafforshire, Bassett Hound & LabTYSON\nLow Rider was his birth name because of his appearance, short legs with body very low to the ground and he is a mixture of a few different things. And boy does he have a story behind him. Tyson and his 9 siblings were born in my home after I rescued his very pregnant mother, her very pregnant daughter and another daughter just 6 months old. They had been dumped in a local park here in San Antonio, Texas. It was freezing cold and raining outside.\nHis mother gave birth about 3 days after I got her and her daughter gave birth the very next week. A different rescue took in the pregnant daughter and the 6 month old daughter.\nAll of the puppies came out very different but healthy and happy. You know a female dog can become impregnated by up to 7 different males and surely this is what happened to Tyson's mother Paris. Miss Paris really had a diverse group of babies!!!!\nTyson was adopted out by a family with kids and even though he was raised inside my home, they kept him outside. He escaped his fence and got hit by a car. Sadly the car that hit him left him there until Animal Control Services (ACS) our city shelter picked him up very injured. He lay all evening and night in a bed of ants that bite him all over. That car really hit him hard.\nThank goodness for microchips, ACS notified me that they had one of my dogs. When I went to pick up Tyson, I was shocked at his injuries. I immediately took him to my vet and he spent a week there before coming home to heal even more.\nTyson endured several surgeries and he is back to being a normal dog. He is happy, friendly and loving, also very obedient. Tyson was not returned to his adoptive family because they were not able to pay the enormous vet fees for his surgeries and care. So I am trying to find the right forever home for Tyson.\nTyson does run and jump, plays chase, wrestles and has no limitations. His back leg is does not bend completely because he had a steel rod in place for longer than normal to help the bones heal to prevent amputation.\nThis is a dog with a very playful and sweet personality; he loves everyone and gets along with other dogs very well.\nI have attached pictures of his injuries, his mother & litter mates and current pictures of Tyson. I plan on posting a video of him soon so you can see him in action and know he has no limitations. Most of all Tyson loves kids and some human attention.\nHe loves the camera; he weighs 37 pounds and a mixture of basset hound, beagle and who knows what else.\nYou can view more pictures on our website: www.roxysk9rescue.org\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our foster dogs are raised in foster homes.

ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE OF $150.00.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and/or phone calls.

I love playing fetch non-stop with my ball, but most of all I love, love, love playing with the water hose where I can jump high in the air! I am very good on a leash with healing and staying with my person. Oh, and I love to be groomed \u2013 brush me and I will adore you forever! There\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t handle all too well, and that is surprises. I do love company and get excited when I see friends but initially, I need a slow introduction to new people. All in all, I am pretty predictable \u2013 my foster mum will tell you all about it if you decide to open your home and heart to me!\n\n[Panda weighs 55 lbs.]\n\n(1706)",

My name is Daisy!\n\nI am looking for a forever home and family who loves to play and snuggle because I love to do both! My favorite things to do include going for walks, riding in the car and playing with my humans. I also love meeting new people! I get so excited!\n\nI like playing with my doggy brother, but I'm not always sure about new dogs. I like to meet them slowly so I can get used to them. I would prefer to be an only child because I love being the center of attention.\n\nI can't wait to see my forever home! Let's go!\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

Being a little nervous and timid, he needs a quiet home and a little extra patience. But once you earn his trust, he's pretty willing to take your lead as long as he's got you in his sights.\n\nTux is a curious Lab mix who is a little reserved when he meets new people. We think Tux is about 7yo. He's housebroken & crate trained. He gets along with other dogs, but hasn't been tested with cats. Tux is neutered and up to date on his vaccinations.\n\nIf you'd like more information about Tux, call 662-342-9448 or email: info@desotoanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "When Jeri and Meri were found, they were essentially feral. They were hiding under a shipping container they had adopted as their home. It is unknown how long they were living there, as the property was only visited by the owners sporadically. When the landowners found them, it took quite a while to coax them out into the open where they were eventually trapped. Both were very skinny, dehydrated and terrified of people. And both are still very wary and untrusting of new people and new situations. On occasion, both dogs still nip their rescuers when they are stressed or excited. This is not to say that they would not warm up to other people. But it will take a \"dog-savvy\" person with great patience, love and a very calm, low activity home. Once the level of trust is earned, either Jeri or Meri would be a sweet companion and friend.\n\nMeri and Jeri will NOT be good with seniors, children or cats because of their unpredictability and their terrier tendencies. They should probably be adopted separately in order to fully bond with the new owner(s).\n\nJeri is neutered, vaccinated and on Heartworm preventative. Meri is spayed, vaccinated, and on Heartworm preventative. You can speak to his foster parents to learn more by calling 662-342-9448 or emailing: info@desotoanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "When Jeri and Meri were found, they were essentially feral. They were hiding under a shipping container they had adopted as their home. It is unknown how long they were living there, as the property was only visited by the owners sporadically. When the landowners found them, it took quite a while to coax them out into the open where they were eventually trapped. Both were very skinny, dehydrated and terrified of people. And both are still very wary and untrusting of new people and new situations. On occasion, both dogs still nip their rescuers when they are stressed or excited. This is not to say that they would not warm up to other people. But it will take a \"dog-savvy\" person with great patience, love and a very calm, low activity home. Once the level of trust is earned, either Jeri or Meri would be a sweet companion and friend.\n\nMeri and Jeri will NOT be good with seniors, children or cats because of their unpredictability and their terrier tendencies. They should probably be adopted separately in order to fully bond with the new owner(s).\n\nJeri is neutered, vaccinated and on Heartworm preventative. Meri is spayed, vaccinated, and on Heartworm preventative. You can speak to his foster parents to learn more by calling 662-342-9448 or emailing: info@desotoanimalrescue.org",

I'm such a sweet girl, puppy pad trained, crate-trained and well on my way to being house trained. I walk to the door to let you know it's time for a potty break. I weigh 40 pounds now. I love other dogs and once I get past my initial shyness I will fall in love with you. More importantly, I'm sure you'll fall in love with me. If you are my forever home filled with love and a little patience, another dog in the home to be my mentor, and a fenced yard to run so I can enjoy my high energy level I'm your gal. I will only walk well on a leash with another dog as my walking buddy. When I'm in unfamiliar circumstances, I'm basically shy and nervous but my foster Mom says when I'm in the house, I'm so very active with lots of energy, sweet and funny. When I get overwhelmed at home I hide under the couch, but with lots of patience and time I come out to play. A favorite activity of mine is riding in a car and giving kisses to adults and kids who I know and am with whom I'm comfortable. I would benefit from obedience training. I love living with other dogs; following their lead inspires my self-confidence. What a girl! Please fill out an online dog adoption application for GWEN. 2/2/21 1:49 PM",

Which means he will need on-going training and is ONLY available to an SF Bay Area experienced, sport dog home.\n\nRoger is a 8 year old, 10lb Australian Terrier/Jack Russell mix, and this guy is ALL terrier!! (His personality is probably closest to that of a Jack Russell) He loves to play with other small dogs, is good with cats (although sometimes he wants to play with them if they run). He LOVES to play (can't say this enough), and he is very high energy. He has learned a handful of tricks (is a titled Advanced Trick Dog), and he competes in USDAA Agility (with two titles already- SPS and PD)!, so he must go to a home that can continue dog sports with him, and keep him very active, both mentally and physically. He's like the energizer bunny, and he is one of the smartest dogs we have ever met, scary smart! He does also love to snuggle with his person and give kisses. He's crate-trained and housebroken. His only issue (besides his energy and intelligence level) is *fear aggression toward strangers* (will bite if a stranger approaches, reaches their hand for/toward him, or spooks him), but with lots of patience, management, training (counter conditioning), and carefully monitored socialization, his fear has decreased, but it may never go completely away, so you can never let your guard down with him. He has gotten a LOT better in his foster home over the last several years, but will need someone to continue the right kind of training with him. He does seem to warm up much faster to young women than to older people or men. This is why he'd do best in a home with NO children and with someone experienced with terrier or high energy breeds (like herding dogs) and near-professional dog behavior experience. Once you give this dog a chance, you will fall in love! He's really such an absolutely brilliant dog, the life of the party! Roger has been in rescue since 3/2011.\n\nRoger is neutered, up to date on his shots, microchipped, and will come with a collar, harness, leash, and bag of food!\n\nPlease contact Diana at (510) 333-4420 or theperfectdogrescue@gmail.com or fill out the adoption application: http://www.theperfectdog.org/TPDadoptapp.doc\nPlease contact Diana at (510) 333-4420 or theperfectdogrescue@gmail.com or fill out the adoption application:\nhttp://www.theperfectdog.org/TPDadoptapp.doc\n1/7/21 3:29 AM",

REQUIRES A SECURE FENCE. Gus needs to be placed in a home without children. Gus is being fostered in Plymouth, IndianaGus is a 6 year old male Border Collie that we took in from a hoarding situation in Central Indiana. He has come a long way with his social skills but he will need someone who will be very patient with him. His foster says that he will mingle when people come for meet and greets with the other dogs, but he does not yet approach strangers. He is good with cats and dogs, loves chew bones and will chase balls, Gus does well with a routine and would do best placed in a home with a canine companion.************************************************** Gus has come a long way....but still has miles to go. He loves, loves, loves playing with other dogs and I think that has really saved him. He is one of the first dogs to welcome new dogs and initiate play. He is good with dogs of all sizes....toy to giant. He willingly follows me around through the yards and is always very curious about what I'm up to. He comes within sight when I call him. He comes inside when called and seeks out his crate. With the every day routine he is great....outside of his 'normal' tasks or outside of his familiar play yard he is non-functional and very much a flight risk. He is excellent in his crate. Good with kitties. Still won't come up to me for any type of touching. He does like to come sniff me though if I am very still. He loves tennis balls and chew bones. When I do need to handle him....he will just freeze and tolerate it. And surprisingly he is good in the bathtub. ....again will freeze and tolerate it....but doesn't try to bolt or escape during his bath time. Tolerates nail trimming as well. This poor guy.....he will never be what we think of as 'Normal' but he is slowly finding out who he is and what he enjoys....it will be fascinating to see what a year will bring.... I think Gus and his mother, Livie (as they are very similar), both need to go to a home that wants a lifetime project, someone with an endless supply of patience and someone that doesn't really 'need' anything from their dog. He definitely needs to go to a home with another dog as he feels more safe when he has a buddy.....and they would need a super secure fenced yard. (12/16/14)**************************************************Gus - If you can imagine how a feral barn kitty behaves and flees from perceived danger..that will pretty much give you an idea of Gus. He is basically feral. In the time that he has been with me he has become very good at everything that he can predict and what becomes a routine in his day to day activities. He knows how to get to the door to go outside, he goes to the proper gate to get in to his play yard area, he will come when called from his play yard to the door to come back inside, he will go find his crate and go in voluntarily. Just this past week or so he has been starting to want to approach me while other dogs are near me to get some good sniffs. I just ignore him and let him do his thing and I try not to put any social pressure on him whatsoever. His interactions with other dogs has progressed much more rapidly. He loves meeting new dogs and regularly initiates play with other dogs. He really enjoys chew time with hard bones, nylabones, etc and he will chase after balls then will act silly playing with the ball by himself. He was actually quite good for his bath and nail trim..frozen as you can imaginebut didn't try to constantly flee like Livie does. When riding in the car he needs to be in a plastic crate..in a wire crate he is frantic and tries to chew out of crate and screams like he is being killed.in the plastic crate he is calm and quiet and rides very well. At the dog school he is learning to follow pressure from the leash on his collar..but in a new environment such as the vetwhere he can see the great outdoors.he will frantically fight the leash and act completely feral.. I carry him whenever we leave his familiar and safe little world. He will need a super secure, most likely a privacy fenced yard.he does know how to dig in corners of fences and I have had to block all my corners, even with having the turf down. He should NEVER be left outside unattendedhe is a major flight risk and would be extremely difficult to catch. A new adopter would need to let him drag a line for several weeks until he could settle in to a new routine. The person that will best be suited for Gus and Livie for that matter..is someone looking for a project..to actually SAVE a dog. A person that has no expectations and is just patient and willing to let things progress at a slow speed. He has tried but just struggles with himself about if it is safe to approach humans. I think another dog in the home is a good idea because he does really enjoy playing with other doggies and he is fine with cats. (9/24/14) Gus is being fostered at Stephany's in Plymouth, Indiana.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact stephodellfcr@hotmail.com for more information about this pet.Noah is an active 6 year old smooth coat male BC. He and his brothers came from Central Indiana and are being fostered in Plymouth, Indiana. If you would like additional information on Noah, contact Stephany at stephodellfcr@hotmail.com. For additional information on adopting Noah or any of the other CBBCR foster dogs, go to the CBBCR website at www.comebyebcrescue.org. Update January 18, 2016\nTy and Noah\n\nThese two handsome boys are brothers and are now about 4 1/2 years of age. It isn't required that they be adopted together but they would sure love that possibility. These boys are very sweet and affectionate boys. Ty and Noah need to be placed in a home without children.\n\nThey are initially a bit suspicious of people they don't know, Ty more so than Noah, but given a little bit of time to become familiar they are both loves. They are both good with other dogs and regularly interact with other dogs. They both love to chase along after my Border Collie when we are playing fetch.\n\nNoah likes to stalk kitties and Ty could care less about them. They both enjoy riding in the vehicle but both are nervous when they are in an unfamiliar environment. They are both good in the house but are still crated when I am not home. Their crate behavior is much better now compared to when they were youngsters but still need the opportunity to go out for potty breaks often and shouldn't be left for more than about 4 hours at a time.\n\nTheir idea of a perfect home setting would be a quiet, country setting with a large fenced yard for them to play and have fun with their people and to have at least one stay at home parent. They would be best as home bodies and to go along places for ride alongs but are not the type of dogs that will enjoy going EVERYWHERE and being around lot of \"strangers\" on a regular basis. If they are not adopted together they would do best in a home with another dog because they do seem to feel safer when they are in the presence of other dogs.\n\nNoah has been introduced to some agility obstacles and even though he is hesitant at first, when he is given a little time to get the obstacle figured out he seems to have fun learning how to maneuver the obstacle. These boys are looking for a patient person to provide them with a forever home. Someone who will love them for the soft, sensitive boys that they are and allow them to live in a quiet and predictable home.\n*******************************************\nNoah - This guy is a sweet boy that is typically very comfortable meeting new people when they come here for meet and greets. He likes toys but will shred soft, squeaky toys. He is foodie and enjoys learning. He did get to go to an agility open class once and very quickly found out how much fun it is to put his paws up on things ;) He is a very cuddly and affectionate guy. He does tend to have times in his crate where he salivates and has anxiety - but it is not all the time and seems to happen randomlynot because of one thing or another. He is good in the car, reasonable on leash. Good for bathing and nail trimming. I really like Noah and think he has the potential to be a nice companion level pooch for the right person. He gets a bit worried in new environments and is a soft, sensitive young guythat also will need a patient and understanding human. (9/24/14) *******************************************************\nOh, baby Noah.....he is sooooooooooooooooo cute and also a tennis ball junky! He loves, loves, loves tennis balls!!! He takes a bit longer than Spense and Jude to warm up to new people and a new evironment....he and his brother Ty are the most 'soft' of this litter born on September 16, 2013. He is a foodie puppy, and lots of ball drive, and once comfortable in his environment is such a fun boy. He very much enjoys playing with other dogs....was a barker at my kitties at first but now they are old news....he is very good in his crate...it is a rare day that he would have an accident in his crate....which again is awesome compared to how we started. I believe Noah will blossom into a wonderful companion level dog in the right home, that is patient and gentle and knows how to keep him safe and satisfied in his day to day adventures!! (3/28/14)",

The other pups will typically all come running to the puppy song, but if Magic is \"busy\" she will continue to do what she is doing vs coming to me with her siblings. She loves toys and food and is good in her crate. I like her tooI think she is a middle-of-the-road sort of dog that a wide range of folks will enjoy. (9/24/14)",

EXPERIENCED HANDLER NEEDED. Livie needs to be placed in a home without children.Livie is a 10 year old female Border Collie being fostered in Plymouth, Indiana. Livie will need a family who will be patient with her. Please contact stephodellfcr@hotmail.com if you have any questions about Livie. You can complete an application to adopt Livie or any of the dogs on our website at www.comebyebcrescue.org.Livie - again a feral barn cat will give you an idea of her flight response. When she was with her puppies she was much easier to handle. Now that she wants nothing to do with her pups, she is back to avoiding being handled. She also is very good at her day to day routine.as long as she can predict what is needed from her she is very compliant. She goes in and out well on her own. Comes to the door when called to come insidefinds her crate and readily goes in without any help or encouragement. In the play yard she mostly just enjoys napping in the sun..she doesn't want to play with other dogs. She will typically watch me as I am moving around the yard and if the gates are open into the other play yards, she will readily follow me to see what I am doing in the other yards. She seems to like to be around me, she just doesn't want me to approach her. There are times that I do approach her and need to approach herand I basically have to catch her. Once caught she will tolerate handling. She is clearly afraid but will just freeze and go inside herself and cope with it.she has never tried to bite or get me out of her space by growling, showing of the teeth or anything like that.. she just is frozen stiff..then once she feels she can escape, she will get away from me..but again will turn around and watch meif I call her to her crate or to the door she will still come back in to my space to comply.Livie and her son, Gus, are adaptable but they will likely never be dogs that will do well outside of what is familiar, predictable and safe. Taking them EVERYWHERE is not the life they will enjoy. Livie is more stressed for bathing and typically tries to escape during bathing time. She rides well in a plastic crate in a vehicle. She can also ride loose and does ok, but since she is such a flight risk, I have her ride crated. She loves the Nature's Variety Raw medallions and actually gets a look of excitement in her eyes when I offer them to her.they are the only thing that she will currently take from my hand. She also enjoys bully sticks when she is outside of her crate..she won't chew them when in her crate. Again, she is a project dog and will need an adopter without expectations, just one that is calm, patient and understanding of the trauma that Livie has likely endured for her entire life. The psychological damage is always going to be thereshe is adaptable and can learn a routinebut will never be great with the \"unfamiliar\" (9/24/14)",

Bear is good with other dogs, however he can be a bit of a target for dogs to pick on.... he hates confrontation with other dogs and will usually bark and sort of scream a bit to ask them to give him some space. He is not a dog that wants to fight with other dogs....he wants to flee. He currently lives in my home with 10 other dogs and is great! He will chase kitties for fun but has never tried to hurt them. He is suspicious of people he doesn't know and will avoid them when given the choice....however he will play ball with ANYONE!! Once he is familiar and comfortable with someone he is great. I have zero issues with handling him for grooming, nail trimming, etc. He does have to be muzzled for vet visits as he doesn't want strangers invading his personal space. I typically muzzle and handle him for his vet visits so that he is not stressed about someone doing it. He has taken a few Agility classes and has worked with a few different people in those classes and works well with other people in a training setting. He wouldn't take much more work to have ready for Novice Agility classes. He would make a nice performance partner for a dog savvy handler. One that understood that fearful dogs need space and to feel safe before they can be expected to perform in unfamiliar environments. Bear has been overlooked for years due to his quirks which I can understand but he is just a super easy dog to live with in my country setting. I haven't given up hope that he may have a home of his own one day (4/2020) Bear will need a family who will be patient with him as he is slow to warm up to new people and places. Please contact stephodellfcr@hotmail.com if you have any questions about Bear.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact stephodellfcr@hotmail.com for more information about this pet.Ty is an active 6 year old smooth coat male BC. He and his brothers came from Central Indiana and are being fostered in Plymouth, Indiana. If you would like additional information on Ty, contact Stephany at stephodellfcr@hotmail.com. For additional information on adopting Ty or any of the other CBBCR foster dogs, go to the CBBCR website at www.comebyebcrescue.org. Update January 18, 2016\nTy and Noah\n\nThese two handsome boys are brothers and are now about 4 1/2 years of age. It isn't required that they be adopted together but they would sure love that possibility. These boys are very sweet and affectionate boys. Ty and Noah need to be placed in a home without children.\n\nThey are initially a bit suspicious of people they don't know, Ty more so than Noah, but given a little bit of time to become familiar they are both loves. They are both good with other dogs and regularly interact with other dogs. They both love to chase along after my Border Collie when we are playing fetch.\n\nNoah likes to stalk kitties and Ty could care less about them. They both enjoy riding in the vehicle but both are nervous when they are in an unfamiliar environment. They are both good in the house but are still crated when I am not home. Their crate behavior is much better now compared to when they were youngsters but still need the opportunity to go out for potty breaks often and shouldn't be left for more than about 4 hours at a time.\n\nTheir idea of a perfect home setting would be a quiet, country setting with a large fenced yard for them to play and have fun with their people and to have at least one stay at home parent. They would be best as home bodies and to go along places for ride alongs but are not the type of dogs that will enjoy going EVERYWHERE and being around lot of \"strangers\" on a regular basis. If they are not adopted together they would do best in a home with another dog because they do seem to feel safer when they are in the presence of other dogs.\n\nNoah has been introduced to some agility obstacles and even though he is hesitant at first, when he is given a little time to get the obstacle figured out he seems to have fun learning how to maneuver the obstacle. These boys are looking for a patient person to provide them with a forever home. Someone who will love them for the soft, sensitive boys that they are and allow them to live in a quiet and predictable home.\n**************************************************************** Ty has come a long way from where he was at 5 months of age. He is now a sweet and cuddly boy that is very comfortable in his familiar environment. He is excellent with other dogs and fine with cats. He is typically a bit suspicious of unfamiliar people but if given a little space and time he warms up fairly quickly. Ty is a very soft and sensitive boy that is very effected by a change in his environment or routine. He is looking for a home with humans that are very patient and understanding and realize that he will need adequate time to become familiar with them and his new home.this will not happen in 1 week, or two weeks and likely not even 6 weeks. He is a wonderful doggie but wasn't allowed to have the best start in life and had no exposure to novel stimuli and very little interactions with humans until he was rescued by CBBCR at 5 months of age.He needs a forever home where he won't have to be crated for more than about 2-3 hours at a timeand a home that will give him plenty of opportunity to go outside for potty breaks..or someone that would have access to a doggy daycare where he could go daily while his humans are at work away from home. (12/6/14)*******\nTy is a very calm BC. One of the most, calm pups I've ever been around. He is an observer and likes to lay and watch what is going on and takes it all in. He enjoys lounging in the baby pool on hot days.he LOVES squeaky toys but will shred them. He also like to have a good chew on a hard bone while he is sunning himself in the yard. He doesn't like to chase the water hose but loves to chase other dogs while he is chasing the water hose. He is an affectionate and cuddly guy. Good for bathing and nail trimming and acts reasonable on leash. Again, a softie and is worried when out of his familiar environment. He is the biggest of his brothers but is still in the 40# range. He is a sweetie pie but is soft and will also need a very patient and understanding human in his life. When meeting new people, he is typically stand-off-ish..but is quiet. He does not bark at people he doesn't know and will warm up much more quickly than his brother. (9/24/14)********************************* Ty is the biggest pup of the litter and is just as sweet as he is big! Born on September 16, 2013, he is one of the softest pups of the bunch and takes a little longer to warm up to new people and new environments than his brothers...but once he does is very much a joy to be around. He also loves squeaky toys and if left to his own with them, will shred them.... He loves playing with other doggies and is good with the kitties. He is VERY foodie and will be a fun boy to train due to his intense food drive! Again, I believe he will blossom into a wonderful companion level boy in the right home, that is patient and gentle and knows how to keep him feeling safe and satified in his new adventures!!(updated 3/28/14)",

He was brought to a shelter because he developed a tumor on his leg and his owners wanted him \"disposed\" of. We weren't going to let that happen and we took him into rescue. Rock had to have his leg removed. The tumor was growing rapidly, and the biopsy showed squamous cell cancer. Because it was not taken care of when it first appeared, our vet feels the chances that it spread elsewhere is likely. We know he more than likely needs a hospice home. He gets along with all people and seems to like small dogs. Because he was so emaciated, we can only guess that he had gone without food for a long time, and he now has resource guarding issues - it will take some time for him to adjust to the fact that he no longer has to fight for scraps. He will need to be fed separately and at scheduled feeding times with no free range feeding including treats. It is recommended that he not be placed with children who will hand food or take food from him. Rock is very smart, he learns quickly, and he is a good boy who just needs a loving home to spend however much time he has left in.

We've gone to great lengths for her and we hope you are willing to too! Her sight and sense of smell are compromised and her hearing enhanced. Chloe is loving and fun, but preferably needs a home with retired or stay-at-homes, experienced with traumatic brain injuries or special education. Chloe has mealtime frustration anxiety and prefers eating alone, knowing her morsels are hers alone. A home where she can settle in before introductions to other pets would be great, but she may do best in a home without other dogs. Cats are okay! A home with a fenced yard would be best. Chloe LOVES to run free like the wind. A home where a potty accident can be cleaned up and she can continue to learn that potty time outdoors reaps treats and indoors doesn't! We have faith she CAN do this, so should you!! A home where anti-seizure medications are lovingly administered and seizures patiently guided through. As much as she needs all this and more WE need this too because though none of us fit the criteria, we all love her.\nShe is up to date on her shots, microchipped and spayed.\nIf you would like to adopt Chloe, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.",

She knows sit, stay, down, potty, crate and other commands in sign language.

            "description": "Nugget: (Nugget is a special case looking for a special home) He has been with us 3 years now and nobody wants him because he is prone to nipping when scared.\n\nNOTE: Nugget was abused in the past and while he is loving, he will snap if he is scared. I'd call it your typical chihuahua fear nip. He will sometimes wake up from a nightmare and snap out. He needs a home that understands chihuahua type mentality. His foster mom understands...we know there is a home out there that can love him as we do! He is very playful and can be very loving, laying in your lap and pawing for attention.\n\nRequirement: Home with no children, fenced yard. No large dogs. Understanding of chihuahua fear nips. Lots of love! Experience with fearful dogs and previous vet history required.\n\nMale\nLonghaired chihuahua dachshund mix.\nAbout 16lbs now but is chunky.\nAround 6 years old.\npotty trained -though every animal has to learn the new homes schedule.\nwill sleep in bed or in kennel\nnot kenneled when people not home as he is trusted having roam of home.\nSmall dog friendly, is a more dominant male.Enjoys playing with other dogs but would be fine on his own too.\nCats - use to chase, now he plays with them! He has learned so much with his time under our rescue.\nSpunky and outgoing yet so sweet when he comes to cuddle or get attention.\nRequires a home with no children.\nRequires fenced yard. No large dogs.\n\nIntake Date : May 17th, 2016. From Caddo Parish Animal Services. It has been over a year and Nugget has not had any interest :( We hope his potential new family will see this one day and help us take a boy that deserves so much in life and give him the best.\n\nVetting: Vet exam. Had neutered. Microchipped under rescue (info below). Up to date on shots. Dewormed and treated for tapeworm. Treated for kennel cough. Heartworm tested and was positive. We did slow treatment and he is now heartworm Negative!!! Currently on proheart for heartworm prevention (shot that lasts 6 months) and Bravecto for flea/tick prevention (lasts 3 months).\n\nHistory: We were at our local open intake shelter looking for a dog to save. We saw this little boy cuddled up by another dog on a bed. They told me he was heartworm positive and his euthanasia time was coming up before much longer. ( This means he was going to euthanized all because he had heartworms. Heartworms are preventable and treatable. Sadly there are so many in our area that many have to be euthanized for space. He is now heartworm negative. ) Nugget was caught in a trap somewhere before being brought in to animal control. He must have had a rough past.\n\nName: We named him Nugget because the day that we saved him from the shelter and went to drive to the vet he got in the floor of my truck. He was too scared to get back up on the seat so I lured him up with.... you guessed it....a chicken nugget! I said that can be your name....little Nugget!\n\nPersonality: Spunky is my best description for Nugget. He loves playing with toys and other small dogs. He acts like a kid! Enjoys running outside and when he's ready he will be at your feet for love and attention. Likes to lounge on the couch and toss toys around. Enjoys cuddling in a lap (but don't think hes just cuddly, it's a risky danger zone when he's on your lap because if you make a movement that scares him, he may nip) . Sleeps in the bed at night or will go in kennel. Is not kenneled when left home because he does good out. May be a more dominant male. Our foster has a dominant male in the house so they constantly quarral. It is likely the other males fault as he doesn't give up haha. Nugget does well with all over dogs though, female and males. Just no large dogs. Overall... he's just a spunky boy!\n\nPast: Nugget has come a long way during his time under our rescue. He use to have certain anxiety triggers but they have greatly decreased. He use to be scared of coming up to me when I came to visit, now he comes for love and attention! He is funny about how he is pet...kind of like a cat at times. I personally just dont go flying in my hands above his head. I'm gentle with him and have noticed the difference. In the past he would bite at my boots, well the other day we were running around the yard playing chase together! His little triggers could be talked about in depth with anyone thinking of loving this boy forever! He is constantly becoming overcoming past battles and we are very impressed. He is so deserving of a loving home.\n\n.Requirements: Understanding of fear biting. No children. Fenced yard. Must be kept on monthly heartworm prevention like every other dog. No large dogs. Experience with fearful dogs and previous vet history.\n\nVetting is all fully up to date. Regular yearly vaccines, heartworm prevention and tests, fecals, microchipped and neutered, etc.\n\nAdoption: Adoption donation fee $50. This in NO way covers the amount of donations that have went to this animals vetting and care. Feel free to ask us any questions especially on sweet Nugget. He has been waiting a long time for a family.\n\nGo to https://www.rockersrescue.org/info/adoption to apply for adoption. Try to include as much about yourself as possible.\n\n1/1/21 3:49 PM",

            "description": "This handsome guy is Ryland and he's a newer addition to the rescue. Found as a stray, he ran out of time at the animal shelter so we took him in. He needed some TLC since he was underweight, had a urinary tract infection and there was an old fracture in one of his feet. He rehabbed well, got neutered and he is now at the rescue and ready for a new home. Ryland is about 4 years old, tall and handsome despite the old scars on his face and his ears are cropped but they don't stand at all. He is ok with most dogs but some males can put him on edge so we are going to recommend him for a home with female dogs so he can feel more comfortable. He is very sweet with people and his charming, gentle demeanor wins everyone over quite quickly. We haven't seen him with small children but older kids that know how to handle dogs and respect boundaries should be ok. Ryland is a smart guy and he isn't thrilled with being left alone outside so a secure yard will be necessary or even better, a home that can teach him some house manners so he can remain indoors. He is crate trained and feels very comfortable in that secure environment so we highly recommend continuing his training so he will be the perfect gentleman. You're going to have to meet Ryland in person to fully fall for those big, brown eyes but that's easy to do. He is at the rescue in Fillmore, ca so you can contact us at dobierescue@earthlink.net or 805-524-5102 if you have any questions.",

            "description": "Zhorbit has been in foster care with New Rattitude for most of her 13 years due to anxieties and fears stemming from residual issues from her original home where, for the first three years of her life, she was neglected, not socialized or trained, and very likely abused. As a result, she is a fearful dog when she is out of her comfort zone, and she exhibits typical fear responses that she will never completely unlearn. When the people around her are sensitive to her stressors and triggers, Zhorbit is happy, relaxed, and obedient. She enjoys daily walks for exercise to keep her 15-lb. figure in good shape. Although she won't tolerate being picked up, she does enjoy snuggling up to her favorite human for quiet time. She is not a fan of cats, and while she tolerates some other small dogs, she would not do well in a multidog household and definitely would be happiest as an only dog. Zhorbit is house-trained and will bark to be let out. However, she has recently begun having occasional nighttime accidents due to the twice-a-day diuretic she's on due to a grade 1-2 heart murmur. She also takes daily medication to reduce her anxiety. The monthly cost for the two medications is about $75. Because of Zhorbit's special needs, potential adopters must live within driving distance of Lansing, Michigan, so they can have a preadoption meet-and-greet with Zhorbit and her foster parents. Due to Zhorbit's fear issues, she cannot be adopted to a family with children under the age of 10. For more pictures of Zhorbit, visit her online photo album at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/zhorbitdewittmichigan .\n\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.\n\n2/2/21 11:01 AM",

            "description": "Daizy is a beautiful 5 year old (Jan. 2019) female Akbash. Daizy has been an outdoor dog her whole life; however, is very smart and would pick up on house-training quickly.\nDaizy is absolutely loving and friendly with people, even around food. She loves and protects children but may be too active for small children. She tends to knock them over. She doesn't require much exercise but a long walk at least once a day would probably be necessary if she is in the house.\nDaizy need to be the only dog in the home. She does not do well with other dogs, small or large. Daizy also tends to be rough with livestock so would not be an ideal guardian for them. She has been known to jump fences or dig under. She loves to roam but has been successfully fenced in with a bit of creativity.\nThe adoption fee for Daizy is $200 which includes the spay or neuter surgery and vaccinations (rabies and parvo/distemper). We show dogs by appointment or at adoption events. If you would like to meet Daizy, please call and leave a message with Lisa (Director of Four Paws Rescue) at (435) 764-3534 or email us at scfourpaws@hotmail.com.\nPlease be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs!

            "description": "Tuck is one of our very special rescues, having been with us for basically all of his life after coming to us as a puppy in 2013. While we've had him for adoption since and even at some of our events, Tuck just doesn't \"show well\" which has led to him being with us for so long. But that doesn't mean that he isn't a simply wonderful fellow and well deserving of his own home.\n\nTuck was brought to us as a puppy of only about 3 months of age. When his former owner asked if we could take him and his sister, Tina, into our rescue, we had to ask him to bring them back in a couple of days so that we could prepared a kennel for them. Although the man agreed, he simply left our rescue and then abandoned both pups into the yard of a lady, who witnessed his actions, and drove away. The following day, the woman brought both pups to us and told us what this man had done.\n\nGrowing up in the rescue, Tuck has become accustomed to life at SoCo Rescue. While he is very friendly to those of us that he knows, he will\n\nbark defensively at strangers. But after he gets to know someone, he is very friendly towards them. We're confident that if just the right person comes along, someone willing to be a little patient with him, then they'll be gaining a wonderful and devoted companion. Tuck does love a good game of fetch and his doggie treats, both of which are good ways to make friends with this big, lovable fellow.\n\nOver the years Tuck has been kept up to date on all of his yearly vaccinations, wormings and monthly preventatives, which has also led him to being heart worm negative. He's definitely a healthy boy who could even stand to loose a few pounds! Of course he'll need some training to become fully acclimated to living in a home but we'd expect that he'd pick up on those qualities rather quickly.\n\nIf another dog is to be included in the home, a meet and greet would be required prior to the adoption. We don't know how he'll be with cats as he's never been around them.\n\nIf you can find it in your heart to give this very special fellow the opportunity that he deserves, then please submit an application at socorescue.com",

After a few weeks of food and care Brandy became very grateful. She is one of the sweetest girls ever. It might take some time when meeting new people to come around but when she does she's extremely loving. While Brandy has associated with a few other dogs, she is typically very dog aggressive and should be kept as an only dog unless professional training corrects this trait. Brandy has lots of love to give and would make a great addition to any home without pets/small children.\n\nAs of 10/10/16 it's estimated Brandy is 5 years old. Her heart worm status is yet to be known as she hasn't been vetted yet. Brandy is house trained but may need a refresher course once in her new environment.

            "description": "Tina is one of our very special rescues, having been with us for basically all of her life after coming to us as a puppy in 2013. While we've had her for adoption since and even at some of our events, Tina just doesn't \"show well\" which has led to her being with us for so long. But that doesn't mean that she isn't a simply wonderful girl and well deserving of her own home.\n\nTina was brought to us as a puppy of only about 3 months of age. When her former owner asked if we could take her and her brother, Tuck, into our rescue, we had to ask him to bring them back in a couple of days so that we could prepared a kennel for them. Altho the man agreed, he simply left our rescue and then abandoned both pups into the yard of a lady, who witnessed his actions, and drove away. The following day, the woman brought both pups to us and told us what this man had done.\n\nTina has grown into a very loving and devoted dog to those she knows. She will bark defensively at strangers but after she gets to know someone, she is very affectionate towards them. You have to realize that Tina's \"home\" has been our rescue and she acts with us as she would if she'd been in a home for these past few years. But we're confident that if just the right person comes along, someone willing to be a little patient with her, then they'll be gaining a wonderful and devoted companion.\n\nOver the years Tina has been kept up to date on all of her yearly vaccinations, wormings and monthly preventatives, which has also led her to being heart worm negative. She's definitely a healthy girl who could even stand to loose a few pounds! Of course she'll need some training to become fully acclimated to living in a home but we'd expect that she'd pick up on those qualities rather quickly. If another dog is to be included in the home, a meet and greet would be required prior to the adoption. We don't know how she'll be with cats as she's never been around them.\n\nIf you can find it in your heart to give this very special girl the opportunity that she deserves, then please submit an application at socorescue.com 2/2/21 1:19 PM",

He really is a big baby at heart.\n\nMax has been living in a foster home for an extended period of time due to medical and behavioral issues.\nUnfortunately Max was diagnosed with hip dysplasia shortly after joining ASR and a hip replacement was recommended and performed.\nShortly after his surgery he began showing signs of infection and the replacement needed to be revised with a second surgery.\nMax is now doing great with his new hip, but he continues to struggle with fear aggression towards those outside of his immediate family.\n\nHis foster family has been able to manage Max's limitations by putting him up when visitors are in their home and expects that any potential adopter would need to do the same.\n\nIf you think you may have room in your heart and home for a special needs placement like Max, please reach out to his foster for more information: furryfriends24@yahoo.com\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com.

            "description": "Jake is a 4 year old male Shepherd mix we rescued from Sacramento. Due to fear based issues he has had a harder time finding the best placement.\n\nSuper sweet and full of love once he trusts you\nDoing well with basic obedience\nHouse and crate trained\nWorking on getting comfortable with the common city noises\nLearning better manners with dogs\nRides well in the car\nHas shown some anxiety being left for long periods of time\nDue to his fear issues needs an adult household\nWill need an active family to burn that nervous energy\nNeeds a home who can help him build his confidence; he does best with clear leadership and a routine\nNo cats/small animals\n\n\nAdoption fee includes altering and current vaccinations. Additional donations always welcome. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog please visit our website, www.coppersdream.org, to get the adoption process started.\n\nWe hold adoption events from San Francisco to the South Bay. Most dogs will be ready to go home the day of the adoption event. We accept credit cards and cash for our adoption fees. While adoption events are a great showcase for these amazing dogs, you don't need an adoption event to adopt a dog. Check out our adoptable pups, submit an application, and then meet them at their foster home! www.coppersdream.org\n\nWe try to post the dogs that are attending on Facebook before the event, please visit and like us on Facebook.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CoppersDream\n\nTo View other dogs up for adoption please visit our website, www.coppersdream.org\n1/30/21 12:01 PM",

If that is with you - so much better! A ride in the car, a run on the beach, a swim - Freddie is your guy. Loves tennis balls and tug-a-war - Hide and Seek. Fred loves to ride shotgun when we go for frequent car trips. He is a momma's boy and talks until you pay attention to him.\nHe is docile, very attentive and bright. He is gentle and would rather play with the older kids or other dogs in the house than with his rough and tumble siblings. Freddie loves to cuddle and wants to cuddle before he goes to sleep.\nFreddie needs a firm, loving hand and consistent training. Eager to please - loves being with his family. He is a loving, intelligent animal who needs a lot of stimulus. Freddie talks when he wants something and wiggles his little behind when called. He knows basic commands: Sit potty, bed, and of course treat. He understands 'Share'. but sometimes decides to ignore that command! Freddie will do well in a house with older children and at least 1 other dog. He is bonded to his sister Merry. He will seek her company and sometimes sleeps with her in her crate.\nFred's mom was a Boxer/SharPei and we think dad may have been lab. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FAMILIES WITH SMALL CHILDREN.\nFreddie may not be the most beautiful of the litter, but his personality beats them all. He definitely needs more affection and attention than the rest, but you are truly rewarded with the love and affection 10 times over.

I love kisses, playing tug of war, snuggling, and taking long naps in my humans lap (although i'll nap in my crate if a human lap isn't available). I also love playing with toys, any toys, all toys, yay toys! My favorite thing in the whole world is car rides, though! It doesn't matter where we're going, as long as I can ride in the car with you!\nI am crate trained and house trained! I'd do best without small children because I have a big puppy personality so I'm still learning to keep all 4 paws on the ground when I get too excited. Even though I am a very hyper puppy, that also means I am a great running buddy! I need a little help with leash manners, but trust me I'll run with you as long as you want if you'll have some patience!!\nI've been in rescue since I was a little puppy. I was found in the middle of the street with my brother, and I was so sick and unhealthy that I had almost no hair! I grew up with a lot of anxiety because of this but in my 2 years in rescue I've gotten a lot of training to help with my anxiety. I still need a close eye on me with other dogs when I'm in my house, so I would be best in a single dog home, but I promise to do my ABSOLUTE BEST to be on my best behavior if you have some patience and love for me!\nI can't wait to meet my forever family, who I will love more than ANYTHING!! Please give me a chance to show you that I can be the best companion ever! Will you give me a shot??\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog.

Frankie is very loving and responds to love and affection and positive reinforcement.\nFrankie is eager to please - loves being with his family. He is a loving gentle dog. He knows basic command. Wiggles his little behind when called, knows Sit, potty, bed, and of course treat. He understands 'Share'.. but sometimes decides to ignore that command! He is a favorite in the household!\nFrankie will do well in a house with older children and at least 1 other dog his energy level. Frank doesn't tolerate puppy energy well. Not recommended for families with children under 8.\nFrankie does NOT Kennel, but is also not destructive.

You can apply online by clicking on Application . Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization.

Found emaciated, sick and pregnant, then nurtured back to health by her Foster Mom, Farrah delivered 11 puppies, but sadly none of them survived. As fate would have it, 8 little orphans desperately needed a Mom. They were put together and Farrah fed them, and loved them until they were old enough to be on their own. All of the puppies were adopted but Farrah has been with us since 2016, she's about 6 years old. She's a high energy girl who would benefit from having a playmate and absolutely requires a fenced yard. She'll need a committed family who can help her transition to new surroundings and give her time to adjust. We are so looking forward to the forever that this girl so deserves and we know it's out there for her. She's just waiting for the right one to come along.\n\nInterested in adopting me?

Please take a look at our Courtesy Post pups who are in need of a loving home.\n\nEllie May is a very nice dog, sweet, attentive, active & playful. She was rescued from a high kill shelter, her babies were adopted and now it's her turn for a great life of her own. You guess her breed and you win a dog! She loves kids and adults but should probably be an only dog. Ellie May is very playful, and loves to be held and cuddled, she could be convinced to be a lap puppy. She is a very sweet, affectionate girl, who loves attention. She enjoys running, playing with a tennis ball, and afterwards likes to sit by your side to rest. She needs a little leash training, but hey who doesn't?\nPlease contact Dee at K9rescueva@gmail.com with any questions and for more information, and to meet this sweet dog.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html.

My name is Meya and I am a 7 year old, 60 pound Staffordshire, Husky and Chow mix who loves to climb into your lap and relax with you. I also love to go for walks and play fetch. I walk well on leash and I am great at bringing the ball back during games of fetch. I have learned the commands sit, down, off, out, and stay, but I am still working on drop and leave it. I am pretty easy to train because I love treats! I also love to be with my people and am happiest when I have them all to myself. I adore older kids and love to give kisses. I have been trained to sleep in a crate at night, but if you will let me I would love to sleep cuddled up with you. But, I prefer to be the only pet in your life; cats are definitely not for me. If you know my breed and are looking for a forever friend, look no further than me Meya!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website and complete the adoption application: http://www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet checkClick here to watch a video of Meya.",

I was afraid and too young to be without my mommy. I was quickly taken to the back where they were going to put me to sleep, when an angel from I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue intercepted and saved my life! I showed her how grateful I was by showering her with love and kisses. She said I was as sweet as a Twinkie! Since I was taken from my mommy so early, I have had some struggles, but I don't take life for granted. I am a great dog, but sometimes it takes me a while to trust people and I can bet scared. I am not a snuggly dog and much prefer to have my own space and will let you know when I'm seeking affection. I cannot be picked up. I have a lot of energy and I get along great with other dogs. I would love to go to a home with another dog. I am also great on walks and think they are so much fun! I am ready to live life to the fullest! Can you be my furever family?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E.

He is an adorable 10 year old 74 pound, dalmation/pitbull/pointer mix great with other dogs, smaller and his own size and will only chase a cat if its running (he thinks it wants to play) He loves to chase balls at the beach, the park, the yard...anywhere you want to throw it! He knows verbal and hand commands for sit, wait, down, back, off, in, and outside. He is also crate trained and will go in when asked. He absolutely loves KONG toys and is such a playful boy. Bo loves to travel and does well in the car. He likes camping, the beach, and camping at the beach. Due to his large size, he needs a strong pack leader who will follow through with his training and provide him with a stable and loving environment. Also due to his size, he would do best in a home with older, respectful children.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E.

Annie is a very smart girl who is eager to please and learns quickly. She has a sweet personality and is a total spaz. Annie is a funny girl who also loves to snuggle. She's house-trained, crate-trained, and is learning basic obedience commands.\n\nAnnabelle's favorite game is \"Floor is lava\" where she jumps from couch to couch in excitement, and she LOVES to trick you out of the Lazyboy chair so she can sneak onto it and fall asleep. Annabelle would be a great running buddy and will keep you laughing for hours on end if you adopt this unpredictable bundle of crazy joy!\n\nAnnabelle will do best in a home with older kids, as she is a larger dog and could have a tendency to knock little ones down accidentally. If you would like to meet ANNABELLE, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com or email us for more info at info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you would like to meet Annabelle, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or send email to info@underdogaz.com",

            "description": "Meet Utah! With Utah, you get the best of both worlds! He is a fun-loving pup that loves to play, but also loves to lounge. After a tiring game of fetch, he will snuggle up next to you during Netflix marathons and even hum along to the theme song! He'll do best in a very active home where he can enjoy lots of playtime. Utah would do better as an only dog because he wants to have all of the attention AND he wants his owner to get lots of exercise along with him!\n\nUtah loves water! He could swim for hours in the pool, if one is available to him. If not, he would be happy with a doggy play pool or even just a hose! Utah is a big pooch that is not aware of his size and strength, so make sure that you are not in the pool at the same time! For this reason, he does not do well with small children either. Utah needs a family that will give him plenty of love and attention. He is a big dog, so he will do best in a home with lots of room to roam and a large yard.\n\nUtah is crate trained, but he would rather roam free in the house, and he promises to be a good boy while you're gone. He is house-trained, and is learning basic obedience commands. He is extremely food motivated, and will learn any trick you want to teach him!\n\nUtah has the slight onset of hip dysplasia so takes daily vitamins and medication ($10 a month). A small price to pay for a lifelong friend. UTAH, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com or email us for more info at",

I have taken him to the dog park several times and he has never had any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He loves to play fetch with a ball and likes to be active. He is not aggressive when it comes to food and will eat at his own pace. He can sit, lay down, drop, and stay. He sleeps in his bed on the floor next to me. He is very friendly and has never had any incident in which he bit another person or dog. He has been around small children and is very friendly with them.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

Do you want to play? Or go for a walk? I love going for walks. I behave very well on the leash and love to get out of the house. However, I do get nervous if there are other dogs or cats around. We don't tend to get along very well.\n\nI am very good with people, but I do best as the only dog. I can get protective of my food and space because other dogs can be a bit scary. I would love to go to training to help with my fear and I'm willing to work really hard. I've learned to play fetch and many other tricks, but I'm eager to learn more. Would you be willing to teach me?\n\nI also can jump really high, so I need a closed-in backyard with a high fence. I sometimes like to roam around the neighborhood, but I'm trying to be better. Other than that, I love being pet and getting lots of attention. I am very nice and will be the best dog I can be.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.\n\n2/2/21 9:46 AM",

When I first meet people I am a little hesitant, but if they pass the smell test I let them rub my belly. And I don't care if there is room or not, I will try to sit in your lap. I like to be the alpha so I would do best home will be with strong, dog experienced parent(s) and as an only dog or with a submissive smaller female dog. I would not do well in an apartment because of the other dogs I would encounter. No cats please.\n\nFor further information please email the address in the box to the right.

She gets along great with my male and female dogs, but her ideal companion would be a mellow guy who doesn't mind a little sister who steals his toys. Tortie rings the bells on the door when she has to go out, and she just loves to be in the yard (she's a great gardening buddy!), so a home with a physical fence would be ideal for her.\"\n\n\"Best of all, Tortie is SO smart! She is very treat-motivated and quickly learns anything you want to teach her; she would love a family who will take her to classes to learn even more. She is crate-trained, but rarely needs to be in her crate anymore because she's so well-behaved. I have to admit, this is one foster dog that I would keep if I could - she's just that wonderful!\"\n\nNow 8 years old and weighing in at 56 lbs., this happy, playful girl is spayed, microchipped and eager to meet her new family - could it be yours? Please stop by an upcoming Meet & Greet to find out if Tortie is the right pet for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\n\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit\nbanshockcollars.ca/studies.php\nand\nhttp://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm\n(scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at\nAlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com\n. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!\n\n2/1/21 12:57 PM",

He is a very energetic and a happy go lucky puppy at heart. Duke has so much spunk and so much to offer man's best friend. As playful as Duke can be, he can also be protective but not in an aggressive manner. He hears noise and he starts to bark so he does what dogs do. Duke is loyal and knows some commands, like sit, stay and back. He will listen to sit back and wait for you to let him out when it's time to go out. He also waits to be told to eat as opposed to simply going for the food when placed down. Duke is potty trained and crate trained. Duke needs an active owner that will allow him to be a great dog and a better best friend. Can be successful with other large dogs depending on temperament but best as an only dog. No cats.

She was very sick and rescue only. Once pulled, a foster nursed her back to health and pups were rehomed. When her original rescue shut down, Queenie became a Cause Kid in 2015 and has grown old with us. She is now a little less active, a little hard of hearing, and takes allergy meds, and this older girl loves to cuddle and play with her humans. She has gained a few pounds with the rescue, so short daily walks needed.\nShe is wonderful with humans, and not good with other dogs or cats, so her future home needs to be as an only dog/only animal with an experienced Pitbull/Bully breed lover who understands the breed.\nSee her page here: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/animals/browse Apply here: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/forms/form?formid=3251 Please email CAUSE4SBPAWS@GMAIL.COM for more information on our special survivor, Queenie. 1/27/21 10:43 PM",

We were shocked when we saw his pictures and heard how he had literally been strangled with a belt by his so called owner. His strangulation caused a massive deep cut all around his neck and caused the blood not be able to circulate resulting in his face ballooning until he was unrecognizable. He was confiscated from his owner and charges are pending. In the meantime, we brought him into our rescue and have nursed him back to health. We could tell he didn't know what it was like to be treated kindly, but after talking to him a bit and giving him love, he started wagging his tail. He is BEYOND sweet!! Check him out HERE playing with his friends at daycare!\n\nWe are happy to report that with the help of the vets, we provided pictures and info on the extent of his injuries to the Harris County DA's office. His former owner was prosecuted and justice was done!\n\nClyde is about 4-5 years old and a Cattle Dog mix of sorts. He's friendly and fun-loving but cautious with new people until he knows you mean him no harm. He does great with most other dogs that are medium to large in size. He is high-energy, so he would do best in an active home and with another active dog that can play, and play, and play with him! He's not especially fond of cats, so a home without cats is a must.\n\nClyde is just the sweetest, although he does get his feelings hurts easily when corrected, so he is a quick learner and pleaser. Makes training a piece of cake!\n\nClyde is doing fabulous in his foster home with his 2 canine siblings, but he would really love to find a forever home where he never has to worry again! Contact us at\ninfo@scoutshonor.org\nif you can help!\n\nNo surprise here in Houston and considering the condition he was in, Clyde is heartworm positive, but don't worry. Scout's Honor is taking care of that for him and if you want to adopt Clyde before he's all clear (which would be great!) we will continue to cover the expense of his medicine and next heartworm check. We can explain it all but he's going to be just fine.\n\nCheck out Clyde playing with his friends at daycare HERE",

            "description": "Please meet sweet Sparkle, the Disney Dog! Sparkle is a retriever/Dalmatian mix, and she is just precious. We call her the Disney Dog because she has the most beautiful eye liner and expressive eyes, which make her look like one of the 101 Dalmatians.\n\nSparkle is such a sweet girl and just loves her people and other dogs. Sparkle is housetrained. She is not a fan of her crate, but she is a good girl when left alone in the house. A lot of times, Sparkle's foster mom will find her waiting by the window when she comes home. When her foster mom is home, Sparkle will nudge the back door when she needs to go potty. Even though Sparkle does not like to be locked up in a crate, she does enjoy sleeping in hers when the door is left open. Many nights, she will go to bed in her foster mom's bedroom and end up sleeping in her crate in the dining room.\n\nSparkle is also wonderful with kids. She is so gentle around them and even listens to their commands. Sparkle also gets along with her 4-legged foster siblings and LOVES to play with them. She is not a cat person, so no cats or other small animals!\n\nSparkle has a lot of energy when appropriate and LOVES to run. She does have a bit of thunderphobia, but we are working on desensitizing her to that. She would do well in a home with kids and/or other dogs. She likes the activity and loves nothing more than to lie next to you and cuddle. She knows when it's time to play versus when it's time to just hang out in the house and be calm.\n\nSparkle also LOVES (she loves a lot of things!) squeaky toys and enjoys playing with them a lot. She also enjoys a short game of fetch. She will bring the object to you, and if you ask for it, she will let it go. She will do this about 4 or 5 times, and then she just prefers to chew on the toy. So cute.\n\nSparkle knows basic commands and will follow them if she is awarded with treats. She walks great on a leash as well. What a great girl!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet girl, please contact us at info@scoutshonor.org. To read about Scout's Honor's adoption procedures or to fill out an application for Sparkle, please visit our website at www.scoutshonor.org.\n\nMeet our sweet, lovable senior girl Sparkle. Don't be fooled by \"senior\" this girl still has plenty of energy, love and spunk to last a long, long time.\n\nSparkle has been with us a long time, not because she is ever anything less than a total lovebug, but because she came to us with extreme thunderphobia. And we will tell you all about the beginning if you are truly interested, but nowadays her foster has a plan that seems to be working. On stormy days Sparkle either goes to doggie daycare or her mom works from home. The key is too not leave her alone during storms.\n\nSparkle LOVES other dogs and would do best in a home with a canine sibling. She loves kids too and has even learned to live with a cat.\n\nSparkle is now about 9-10 years old, about 45-50 pounds and is a Dalmatian, retriever mix. She loves toys and playing fetch. She hates crates and being confined but is a good girl left out in the house (without storms\n\n)\n\nSparkle is up to date on vaccines, spayed and microchipped.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet senior girl just fill out the application and we will be in touch soon.\n2/1/21 10:56 AM",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nHello! I'm Romeo. I came to DDRT when my parent got sick and couldn't take care of me any longer. My current foster family has taken great care of me but I am looking for my forever home.\n\nMost of my day is keeping company with the humans in the house. I like to sit in laps while they read or watch TV. I will \"talk\" to them and let them know if I need to go out, or when I'm ready to come back in, if my water bowl is empty, or if I want to play. I'd rather be the only dog in the house and keep the humans all to myself, but if I do have to share the home with another dog, they need to be little like me.\n\nSee, there are things in my life that scare me just a little - like big dogs, certain noises, and laminate or hardwood floors. The noise and texture on my feet doesn't feel so good. I prefer the carpet and tile. I know that sounds kinda silly, but at my age, a guy knows what he wants!\n\nI would love to spend my days on the couch snoozing and taking naps, watching TV with you, and getting belly rubs! Due to my age, I have bone spurs and calcification on disks that may cause me pain, this can be managed by adding fish oil and glucosamine chondroitin (Cosequin pills) to my diet. If you are older, like me, at home most of the time, or like watching TV too - you could be my forever home!\n\nIf you would like to meet this handsome, snuggly, lap guy, please fill out an application for Romeo Too today!\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

She was very sick and rescue only. Once pulled, a foster nursed her back to health and pups were rehomed. When her original rescue shut down, Queenie became a Cause Kid in 2015 and has grown old with us. She is now a little less active, a little hard of hearing, and takes allergy meds, and this older girl loves to cuddle and play with her humans. She has gained a few pounds with the rescue, so short daily walks needed.\nShe is wonderful with humans, and not good with other dogs or cats, so her future home needs to be as an only dog/only animal with an experienced Pitbull/Bully breed lover who understands the breed.\nSee her page here: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/animals/browse Apply here: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/forms/form?formid=3251 Please email CAUSE4SBPAWS@GMAIL.COM for more information on our special survivor, Queenie. 1/27/21 10:43 PM",

We call her the Disney Dog because she has the most beautiful eye liner and expressive eyes, which make her look like one of the 101 Dalmatians.\n\nSparkle is such a sweet girl and just loves her people and other dogs. Sparkle is housetrained. She is not a fan of her crate, but she is a good girl when left alone in the house. A lot of times, Sparkle's foster mom will find her waiting by the window when she comes home. When her foster mom is home, Sparkle will nudge the back door when she needs to go potty. Even though Sparkle does not like to be locked up in a crate, she does enjoy sleeping in hers when the door is left open. Many nights, she will go to bed in her foster mom's bedroom and end up sleeping in her crate in the dining room.\n\nSparkle is also wonderful with kids. She is so gentle around them and even listens to their commands. Sparkle also gets along with her 4-legged foster siblings and LOVES to play with them. She is not a cat person, so no cats or other small animals!\n\nSparkle has a lot of energy when appropriate and LOVES to run. She does have a bit of thunderphobia, but we are working on desensitizing her to that. She would do well in a home with kids and/or other dogs. She likes the activity and loves nothing more than to lie next to you and cuddle. She knows when it's time to play versus when it's time to just hang out in the house and be calm.\n\nSparkle also LOVES (she loves a lot of things!) squeaky toys and enjoys playing with them a lot. She also enjoys a short game of fetch. She will bring the object to you, and if you ask for it, she will let it go. She will do this about 4 or 5 times, and then she just prefers to chew on the toy. So cute.\n\nSparkle knows basic commands and will follow them if she is awarded with treats. She walks great on a leash as well. What a great girl!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet girl, please contact us at info@scoutshonor.org. To read about Scout's Honor's adoption procedures or to fill out an application for Sparkle, please visit our website at www.scoutshonor.org.\n\nMeet our sweet, lovable senior girl Sparkle. Don't be fooled by \"senior\" this girl still has plenty of energy, love and spunk to last a long, long time.\n\nSparkle has been with us a long time, not because she is ever anything less than a total lovebug, but because she came to us with extreme thunderphobia. And we will tell you all about the beginning if you are truly interested, but nowadays her foster has a plan that seems to be working. On stormy days Sparkle either goes to doggie daycare or her mom works from home. The key is too not leave her alone during storms.\n\nSparkle LOVES other dogs and would do best in a home with a canine sibling. She loves kids too and has even learned to live with a cat.\n\nSparkle is now about 9-10 years old, about 45-50 pounds and is a Dalmatian, retriever mix. She loves toys and playing fetch. She hates crates and being confined but is a good girl left out in the house (without storms\n\n)\n\nSparkle is up to date on vaccines, spayed and microchipped.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet senior girl just fill out the application and we will be in touch soon.\n2/1/21 10:56 AM",

            "description": "Meet Clyde!\n\nYou may remember Clyde's sad story of cruelty and neglect. We were shocked when we saw his pictures and heard how he had literally been strangled with a belt by his so called owner. His strangulation caused a massive deep cut all around his neck and caused the blood not be able to circulate resulting in his face ballooning until he was unrecognizable. He was confiscated from his owner and charges are pending. In the meantime, we brought him into our rescue and have nursed him back to health. We could tell he didn't know what it was like to be treated kindly, but after talking to him a bit and giving him love, he started wagging his tail. He is BEYOND sweet!! Check him out HERE playing with his friends at daycare!\n\nWe are happy to report that with the help of the vets, we provided pictures and info on the extent of his injuries to the Harris County DA's office. His former owner was prosecuted and justice was done!\n\nClyde is about 4-5 years old and a Cattle Dog mix of sorts. He's friendly and fun-loving but cautious with new people until he knows you mean him no harm. He does great with most other dogs that are medium to large in size. He is high-energy, so he would do best in an active home and with another active dog that can play, and play, and play with him! He's not especially fond of cats, so a home without cats is a must.\n\nClyde is just the sweetest, although he does get his feelings hurts easily when corrected, so he is a quick learner and pleaser. Makes training a piece of cake!\n\nClyde is doing fabulous in his foster home with his 2 canine siblings, but he would really love to find a forever home where he never has to worry again! Contact us at\ninfo@scoutshonor.org\nif you can help!\n\nNo surprise here in Houston and considering the condition he was in, Clyde is heartworm positive, but don't worry. Scout's Honor is taking care of that for him and if you want to adopt Clyde before he's all clear (which would be great!) we will continue to cover the expense of his medicine and next heartworm check. We can explain it all but he's going to be just fine.\n\nCheck out Clyde playing with his friends at daycare HERE",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nHello! I'm Romeo. I came to DDRT when my parent got sick and couldn't take care of me any longer. My current foster family has taken great care of me but I am looking for my forever home.\n\nMost of my day is keeping company with the humans in the house. I like to sit in laps while they read or watch TV. I will \"talk\" to them and let them know if I need to go out, or when I'm ready to come back in, if my water bowl is empty, or if I want to play. I'd rather be the only dog in the house and keep the humans all to myself, but if I do have to share the home with another dog, they need to be little like me.\n\nSee, there are things in my life that scare me just a little - like big dogs, certain noises, and laminate or hardwood floors. The noise and texture on my feet doesn't feel so good. I prefer the carpet and tile. I know that sounds kinda silly, but at my age, a guy knows what he wants!\n\nI would love to spend my days on the couch snoozing and taking naps, watching TV with you, and getting belly rubs! Due to my age, I have bone spurs and calcification on disks that may cause me pain, this can be managed by adding fish oil and glucosamine chondroitin (Cosequin pills) to my diet. If you are older, like me, at home most of the time, or like watching TV too - you could be my forever home!\n\nIf you would like to meet this handsome, snuggly, lap guy, please fill out an application for Romeo Too today!\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

I'm just a great dog with specific requirements! No dogs, iffy on kids, no cats. Just you and a big fenced yard to play ball. You wouldn't even have to walk me if you throw the ball. I also love walking with you in the yard and you can kick the ball! I have fantastic recall: all you have to do is whistle and I stop to look at you or yell 'Haze'. And if you are lonely too, we'd be the bestest buddies! Say 'Ball'and I bring it right to you. Say 'Drop' and the ball is at your feet. And I love to play Tug with my favorite rope. Just over 7 years old and wonderfully obedient, I'm energetic, playful, and loving. Say 'Sit' and my behind hits the ground. Say 'Down' and my belly's on the ground. Need an alarm dog? I have a BIG bark. I'm good on a leash and very good off-leash. Just say 'Haze!' and I come right to you. Come see me & we just might hit it off! I just know that there is a lonesome person who needs me too!\nI'm house trained and crate trained, and should have an experienced big dog owner. But I love men or women. I am fine with older teenagers but not children.\nUp to date on age appropriate vaccines, neutered and micro-chipped.\n***Haze is available for meet and greets with potential adopters by appointment only.*** (T&WL/CM*)\nAdoption Fee: $100.00 1/31/21 6:30 PM",

My life has certainly changed in the last year. I was one of 38 Chihuahuas confiscated in spring of 2015. I was not very nice at the time. Matter of fact, I hated everyone. I didn't know people could be nice. The girls spent a lot of time working with me. I still like to do my own thing, but I am starting to trust people and their toys. They even have these tasty things they call treats. I sleep inside with my foster mom every night. But I don't like to be carried. I want a home where I can be independent, but still have a nice person to play with when I want to. I have gone completely blind, but I still get around great. It's just hard to find the treats sometimes.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Cooper doesn't look it, but he is 12 years old. He came to us when he was 10 years old. I felt sorry for him and his owner. The guy that owned him had him since he was a puppy. He had recently gotten married and Cooper was unable to transition into a family with two small children. He was totally stressed out and snapping. Now I know what my answer would have been, but the guy was committed to making his marriage work, so Cooper had to go.\n\nHe had a real rough transition at first. He hated being at the facility. I took him my house, and he still wasn't happy. For the first six months he barked constantly. One day he followed me to the kennel and met the puppies. From then on he found his place in the world. He rules the quarantine room. He set up shop in a bottom kennel and he supervises al the workers and volunteers. He is happy as a lark. He loves the new puppies. He wants to babysit. When I was taking pictures, he kept getting on the table to make sure the babies were ok.\n\nI'm not sure that Cooper would be a good candidate at this point for a new home, unless the person had a lot of patience and love to give him. He would really appreciate people sponsoring him. He still gets all the special treatment our adoptable dogs get. Every month he gets heartworm preventative, he gets a Bravecto pill every 90 days and he gets treats and toys. We are committed to letting him have a happy life, but as he ages his care will be more costly.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.My name is Rosco. I was rescued from the Bandera County Pound several years ago. The inmates took care of me at the old facility. They played with me and taught me to be a good boy. When they got full, they called AD4Y Rescue and asked them to save me and here I am.\n\nYou see I don't like change too much. I became very withdrawn when I left my friends at the jail. I had alot more room to run and play and frankly I did everything I could to stay away from the girls. I trusted Ms. Pat, but no one else was going to touch this bad boy. But they wouldn't give up.\n\nOver the last 30 days they have been telling me they are going to get me adopted one way or the other. They told me I have to start being a good boy with strangers and letting new people meet me. I wasn't going to do it, but Ms. Pat made me play with Ms. Kim. Did you know she keeps yummy stuff in her pocket? I tried to resist, but did I mention it was yummy?\n\nThe next thing you know Ms. Kim was taking me on walks and introducing me to new things. You know what? Change really isn't all that bad. I have to admit I love the attention. I am still a little skittish of new people but I am learning to trust people. I even went to the beauty shop and had them cut my hair. It's normally a lot longer.\n\nI love to go on walks, it is truly my favorite thing or is it treats..it's a toss up. I even walk off leash at the ranch! When I warm up to you I am just a big love bug. I give Ms. Kim kisses all the time. I like to chase a ball but I am getting older so I usually just chew on it when I catch it. I have lived in a kennel now for awhile so I would need to be house trained again, but I am sure I can catch on fast, because I am super smart. I am doing great around other dogs too. I know that I can finally trust. I need to lose a little weight. I am slowing down but a nice orthopedic bed by you would be awesome. So iff you have lots of time and patience to help me adjust I will be your best friend for life!\n\nIf you would like to apply for me please go to www.adoggie4you.org and fill out a Companion Pet Application. If you want to help sponsor me, you can donate here. Your donations make sure other dogs like me have a chance at a new life, even if we are slow to adapt.",

We can't help if we don't have families willing to foster, and we are always in need of more foster homes!\n\nIf you live in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Rockford or Chicago, IL areas and want to help save lives, please complete either our online Foster Sign-Up or download a word version here:\n\nhttp://www.northstarshihtzurescue.org/foster/\n\n(please note: neither dog pictured are available to foster or adopt, both are in their forever homes)\n\nNorthStar Shih Tzu Rescue exists to benefit both Shih Tzu and Shih Tzu blend dogs and the people of our community. We operate as a no-kill rescue that provides rescue and adoption services, and meaningful outreach programs in order to advance the welfare of these companion animals, to serve and educate our community, and to make a positive, loving impact on the lives of both.\n\nNorthStar, located in Excelsior, MN, actively works to rescue Shih Tzu and Shih Tzu blend dogs from dangerous environments and shelters with the ultimate goal of placing them in loving, permanent, adoptive homes. We rescue unwanted, abandoned, and abused dogs. We have them vaccinated, micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, provide other medical care, and rehabilitate them in carefully selected foster homes.\n\nWe also serve as a resource to our community and all pet owners by providing education and information on the benefits of adopting an animal in need as well as responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spay/neuter, good nutrition, and positive behavior training. We strive to increase public awareness about companion animal overpopulation, commercial breeders, and to offer solutions to end the killing of adoptable animals.\n\nWe work in alliance with local animal shelters, pounds, other rescue groups, and humane society organizations to ensure these animals are not forgotten.\n\n1/23/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting an ARPO pet, please visit our website, for details about our fees and process, and to complete our Adoption Application. ARPO limits adoptions to within 50 miles of Indianapolis. We do not have a shelter; all pets are in volunteer foster homes.\n\nCossett is a 7 yr old 50 lb hound mix and is an active dog who loves to run and play. She would LOVE to have a doggy playmate, but can be somewhat choosy about her friends. If you have a dog that is looking for a playmate, we would set up a meet and greet. Cossett is a very athletic dog with energy to burn so a fenced-in yard would be best for her.\n\nShe is looking for an ADULT-ONLY home with an owner who has dog EXPERIENCE (behavior, training experience). She is not compatible for a home with children or cats.\n\nShe takes a while to warm up and can be fearful and timid when first meeting people. However, it doesn't take her long to bond with someone and she establishes trust fairly quickly.\n\nCossett knows basic commands and once she gains your trust she is a Velcro dog. She craves attention and affection and loves nothing more than to be by your side. She's house broken and crate trained.\n\nOur adoption fees cover less than half of our medical expenses. We depend on the generosity of all our animal loving friends to help us continue to rescue these animals. Please help us with your on-line donation via Paypal by clicking on the icon below. We are a Paypal Verified site and it is secure.\n\nOr you can mail a check to: Alliance for Responsible Pet Ownership, P.O. Box 6385, Fishers, IN 46038.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting an ARPO pet, please complete the online Adoption Application.\n\nDue to recent coronavirus concerns, we have suspended our public adoption events until further notice.",

            "description": "Initially shy with strangers, Carmine has a happy outlook on life. Once he warms up to new adults, he is a total love bug -- such a sweetheart! He loves to go for long walks, especially along the lakefront in his current foster home. He's dog friendly and enjoys playing with other dogs off leash. And, he loves toys and chasing Frisbees. Carmine even likes water - especially a baby pool.\n\nCarmine is rather quiet, good in his crate, and sleeps through the night on his doggie bed. There's no better feeling when Carmine trusts you and his true personality comes out. It just takes a bit of time. Due to his shyness and probable lack of socialization in his previous life, he's not good with kids - he's scared of them.\n\nCarmine just deserves a chance to be the amazing pup that he can be. He's sweet, affectionate, quiet, and gets along super well with his old foster dog who's 13. He's very respectful and great with him on walks. He's a bit spoiled - loves yogurt and random human food. Are you his forever family that will spoil him, too?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet little nugget, please fill out an application at: :http://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/ (needs to link)\n\nCheck out Carmine's Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/Helpcarminefindahome/. 2/2/21 6:06 PM",

She is independant and relishes being left alone until she wants a hug. She is food agressive. And could be a biter.

            "description": "MEET CHARLIE---\nCharlie is a great little guy - but a tough dog to place and would NOT be a pet for most people. He needs a patient, VERY ALPHA dog savvy owner.\nHe is a King Charles Cavalier mix (?), a very playful and active 5 year old and full grown at about 20 lbs. He is healthy, housebroken, neutered, micro-chipped and LOVES to fetch and bring back! He would do it all day if he could! He is well behaved when left alone and does not need to be crated. In fact, he would be totally OK if he were the only pet and the sole center of your attention. But he doesn't like to be left alone for long periods of time. His ideal home would be where there is NOT A LOT of activity or visitors -- or CATS - as he is not comfortable with new people and situations. But once he feels safe, probably after 2-3 days, he will be your new best friend, sitting on your lap or snuggling in bed. HE IS NOT A 'CONDO or APARTMENT' TYPE DOG.\nWe are not sure of what may have happened to him in his past. He came to us as an owner surrender but he does have 'issues'. Aside from feeding and potty breaks, if you can totally ignore him for several days, he will eventually come to you, but on his terms. Three or four days after coming into your home, he will willingly climb up on your lap or in bed with you -- (he loves to snuggle and be petted). Charlie bonds closely with his owner, showing great affection whenever the owner is present. But is apprehensive, barky and insecure when meeting new people. When a visitor comes, you must keep him on a leash or confine him to another room. He reacts by barking and threatening to 'bite'. He hasn't bitten but we cannot place him in a position where he might! He is still a work in progress.\nHE WILL NOT BE AT OUR ADOPTION EVENTS as that would be too stressful for him. A private meeting can be arranged (Fort Lauderdale). We are accepting applications on him now.\nAdoption fee: $200\n\nDOWNLOAD OUR APPLICATION: www.gratefulpaws.org. Click on ADOPT - at the bottom of that page you will find our application.\nNOTE: Adoption/rehoming fees are applied towards the vet bill: Exam, blood tests, vaccinations, fecal, worming, spay/neuter, and microchip. There is rarely anything left over, but if that happens, the monies get applied to the next or previous pet - who may have had to have an x-ray, be groomed or have a dental. 1/5/21 4:59 PM",

She is learning her basic commands and is doing really well.\n\nBertha, named after the patron saint of female illnesses, was rescued because she was bred to a much too large of a male dog AND then they were puilled forceibly separared by dumb humans. Her insides were hanging out for over two (2) weeks BEFORE the \"owner who loved her\"! came to us and said his dog was in trouble. Bertha has successfully gone through surgery and is recooperating well. She told us she does NOT want to go back to her old family! She has now been spayed and our vet has declared her \"good to go\". BERTHA WANTS ALL TO KNOW SHE HAS LEARNED TO \"SIT\" FOR HER FOOD!!\n\nPHS:1498 http://www.pontchartrainhumanesociety.org/adoption.html\n\nAge:est DOB May 2008\n\nSize (when grown):Medium 40 lbs\nOur $100 dog adoption fee covers sterilization and routine vaccinations.

This boy was found freezing and emaciated, the sad product of severe neglect! Thankfully, he was found by a dedicated T.A.R.A. volunteer who helped him regain his trust, confidence and health! Maveryck is such a handsome boy, we couldn't help but post an entire photo album throughout his time with us! If you scroll to the very last photo, your heart may break into a million pieces as you see how broken and dejected he was when he was found!\n\nMaveryck currently lives in a loving foster home with a large family including mom, dad, human foster siblings and canine foster siblings and he's doing great! He is completely house trained, gets along with other dogs and loves snuggle time more than anything else in the world!\n\nAlthough Maveryck has come so far in his confidence and trust, he can be just the tiniest bit nervous in some new situations. He would do best in a home with a family who understands his past and his current love for life and will continue to provide him a loving and stable home environment!\n\nWon't you make this handsome beauty a part of your family today?\n\nApproximate Birthdate:\n12/08/2010\n\nAdoption Fee: $150\n\nTARA's adoption fee includes: spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test (if age appropriate), heartworm and flea prevention, and deworming. TARA's pets are all eligible for a\n\ntwo week trial\n\n.\n\nDue to the fact that many of our dogs come from the local city shelters, we do not know the background of many of them and therefore cannot always guarantee age or breed. Size is subjective but we use the following guidelines: Small 1-20 pounds, Med 20-50 pounds, Large 50-80 pounds, Extra Large over 80 pounds.\n\nFor more information please fill out an APPLICATION\n\nPlease visit our\n\nEVENTS PAGE\n\nfor information about our upcoming adoption events.",

The head of our dog walking team says that she is excellent on a leash and is overall a good dog.\nHer favorite dogs are big male dogs, like our golden husky Marley.

Once he is comfortable with someone, he is devoted. He will follow them around, obey commands, go up to them, sit by them, and put his paws on them.\nHe is afraid of having things put around his neck. However, he does follow off leash commands. He's a quick learner, and he should do well in a home where he would have one on one attention.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com.

According to them, he is housetrained, good with dogs and kids. His has lots of energy so he will need either a fenced yard or an active family. He is very toy driven, he would rather play with toys than eat. He LOVES toys!!!\nHe has had a rabies shot, 7-way shot, bordetella, and been wormed. He is neutered, microchipped and heartworm tested negative. He came to the shelter 12/16.***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS?

Monty would do best with someone who is a strong handler and can guide him through some basic training. || CATS/DOGS/KIDS: Monty seems to do okay with large breed dogs but is not recommended for small breed dogs. He is not recommended for children under 10 years old because based of his size he would unintentionally knock down children. Monty is not recommended for cats. ||VET RECORD: All of our dogs are currently vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Name: Oakley\nBreed: Belgian Malinois\nAge: Adult\nGender: Male\n\nOakley is an adult Belgian Malinois who has seen a lot in his short life and not much of it good it seems. He came in emaciated, covered in buckshot pellets, a bullet in his elbow, and terrified of the world. Quick movements, hands reaching towards him sent him to the ground expecting the worst and belly crawling away to avoid being hurt. Give him a bit to settle in, build up trust, and gain some confidence and you have yourself a total puppy who loves to run, play, fetch, swim, and have a blast. He is the stereotypical super smart, high energy Malinois once he is comfortable in a home. He is living the puppyhood he never got to have before and loving it. He is still extremely leery and on guard outside his comfort zone and with new people so looking for a home who will do some serious confidence building and training to show him that the world is a safe place and new people are not to be feared. With his foster and at his foster home, he is a silly, playful, always happy guy with a puppy spirit and endless energy. Oakley is tolerant of most other large breed dogs, but no cats or small animals for him. He is housetrained and working through some issues in the crate and doing well. He requires an experienced working dog home who will continue to train and exercise him properly both physically and mentally. He does require a physically fenced yard and an adult-only home. We do not ship our dogs so please keep that in mind if you are outside the MN/WI area.\n\nRequirements:  Fenced yard. No cats. Adult-only home.\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104540557144\n\nYou can email laurahhk9@gmail.com with questions and for a preadopt application. This dog has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated as age appropriate, tested for heartworm disease if age appropriate, and dewormed.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n",

We've had him for 8 years and he is an absolute love but he HATES Golden retrievers with a passion (something must've happened before we got him) and wants to kill the neighbors dog.  He Has NEVER attacked a human and we have 2 young children that love him dearly.  But this is our 2d home with a neighbor w an unneutered male Golden (yes!  2d time!!) and Lucky will real through his electronic fence to get after this dog. He goes straight for the throat and It scares me so much and I don't want anything bad to happen -- to the dogs or to any person who gets in the way.  Lucky is neutered but he is very Alpha and an unneutered male is just a red flag for him.  At least an unneutered male Golden!!   He needs a good loving single dog home with lots of property to roam.  He is a super protective dog and would make someone a great pet.",

She is however the kindest dog you could meet, and really just needs a home where the adopters just want a cuddly, loving girl to hang out with. \nShe will make a great addition to any family.   Come out and find out for yourself. \n\nBirthday: 05-09-2014\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

She is a great pup that is shy with people at first but warms up fairly quickly.  She LOVES other dogs.  She runs around and plays with the other dogs in her foster home.  She will also follow her person around as well.  She is doing well with house training but will occasionally have an accident if she cannot get out side.  She lets you know when she has to go out.  She loves to chew but don't all labs!  She walks great on a leash. Lexi has a little bit of separation anxiety and can escape from a standard crate\n\nLexi is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed and microchipped.",

She is a lovely girl who came to us from Texas after her owner surrendered her. We brought her to Seattle in the hopes that she might have a better chance at finding her forever home.\n\n \n\nParis is extremely loyal to her people.  She loves to cuddle and gives the best gentle hugs. She loves the attention of people and gives all of herself when she's with you. She would do best in a home where there is lots of human attention and someone is there much of the time.\n\n \n\nParis loves to go for walks and is an active girl who would love a family that likes to go on walks, hikes, and adventures. She is the perfect co-pilot if you travel, great in a car and LOVES to go on car rides.\n\n \n\nParis can be reactive with other dogs and would do best as the only pet in the home.  While she'll never graduate to having another pet in the home, she is continuing her training to be neighborly around other dogs on a leash using a Halti head collar. She does well in controlled settings and with proper leadership. She will need a family with reactive dog experience and strong leadership who is committed to continue working with her to overcome her reactive tendencies.\n\n \n\nParis can be protective of her home and would be best suited in a quiet, single family home in a suburban or rural neighborhood. No apartment or attached home living for her.\n\n \n\nParis's adoption fee is $200 and she is up to date on her shots, spayed and microchipped.",

            "description": "Anyone looking for a quarantine buddy? Penny is sweet pup who loves to cuddle or be near her human. She was born in approximately November 2016 Her early puppy months lacked appropriate training and socialization, so she has been in foster learning to live in a home and how to be a good pup. She is a pit mixed with a super skinny breed (maybe a Whippet or Italian Greyhound) and she weighs ~50 lbs. She likes humans but needs to be the only dog in the house. \nPenny would benefit greatly from additional, positive training. She still has a little naughty puppy inside that shows itself sometimes. Her other growth opportunity involves interacting appropriately with dogs. She ignores a clear correction from a dog that does not want to play and bites their ears to get them to interact with her. Therefore, she cannot be taken to a dog park or any other location where she is allowed to interact off leash or unsupervised with another dog. Her home must have a secure, fenced yard. She sometimes chews so she securely confined when left alone. She does not like crates but is OK in a pen. She jumps, mouths, and resource guards so her home must not include kids. \nShe is spayed, up to date on shots including rabies, has tested negative for heartworm, microchipped & comes with a 2018 Hamilton County dog license (good in surrounding counties).\n\nYou can see her in action here:\n\u2022\tScene 1 \u2013 Freedom Ride: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR7gxMIxU9Y\n\u2022\tScene 2 \u2013 Rehab = Making Friends: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3AxrbQSJoE\n\u2022\tScene 3 \u2013 Belly Rubs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4do3ipFugEA\n\u2022\tScene 4 \u2013 The Cuddler: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=aWUHhMxh5Sc\n\u2022\tScene 5 \u2013 More Friends: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=NZ7NWVtlSRQ\n\u2022\tScene 6 \u2013 The Little Spoon: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=ULjd9oPZqIU\n\u2022\tScene 7 \u2013 Kitten Rescuer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlzeOnDs5uA\n\u2022\tScene 8 \u2013 Made about missing the party: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8ronpRk7ks\n\u2022\tScene 9 \u2013 This is awkward: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXY9TqigAtc\nNo appointments to meet will be made until an application is approved for consideration.

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee:  $200.00 \n\nHumphrey is 4 1/2 years old and weighs 8.5 pounds. We feel he is a mix between a Bichon, Maltese and Poodle. He has a cute underbite that is not a problem, giving him a cute square jaw look!  He gets along great with his foster siblings, but it is unknown how he would be with cats.\n\nHumphrey is very sweet, loves attention and loves to cuddle at night.  He is one smart little boy teaching himself to use the doggie door to potty outside.... well most of the time!  He is very active and loves to explore, so anyone adopting him would have to child proof their home. \n\nThe above statements are all the sweet and loving things about Humphrey, but there is some sad news.  Humphrey has poly-arthritis and there is no cure for it..  Yes, at just three years old he has arthritis.  His doctors suspect his kind of arthritis was caused by some sort of infection that settled in his joints causing swelling and pain in his ankles, knees, wrists and elbows.  It is unknown when he developed this condition, but it has been long enough for him to lose most of his muscle mass in his legs and shoulders causing his muscles to atrophy.  For his pain and discomfort he is taking, Lefluncomide suspension and Adequan.  The Adequan is an injection that must be taken for life.   For now, he is not in as much pain and is able to get around much better, but because of the loss of muscle, he is not able to straighten his back legs. This will be a life long condition, and anyone adopting him must be willing and able to care for what his life will be.  He will never be able to be taken for walks, he is unable to jump onto laps or a chair or jump down, and he is not one to want to snuggle.   We have been told, because of the extensive poly-arthritis, his life expectancy will be much less than normal.\n\nFor now, the arthritis swelling is under control, there is no way to know if or when his arthritis will flair up again.  He will always have to be on medicine, so any family adopting him will need to understand this possibility and be willing to take care of any life changes that may develop for him in the future.\n\nHe also tends to want to bite and is food aggressive, meaning he will fight and bite over food.  He does have a nasty habit of eating feces's, called coprophagia.  It's difficult to control him with other dogs in the home because he is very quick.  He will stop if told no but to catch him in the act can be challenging. \n\nHumphrey is now enjoying life in Gainesville, FL taking in the sun until his forever family takes him home.\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

She can play until she drops!! She is quirky, funny and spunky. She is a very smart girl who is eager to please and learns quickly. She has a sweet personality and is a total spaz. She is a funny girl who also loves to snuggle. She is already crate trained, housebroken and is learning basic obedience commands. \n\n Annabelle would be a great running buddy and will keep you laughing for hours on end if you adopt this unpredictable bundle of crazy joy!\n\n Annabelle will do best in a home with older kids, as she is a larger dog and could have a tendency to knock little ones down accidentally. If you would like to meet ANNABELLE, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com or email us for more info at info@underdogaz.com\n\n  \n\n If you would like to meet this dog, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or email info@underdogaz.com",

He has the epitome of a Boxer personality. He LOVES to play tug-of-war and is an excellent fetch dog. He can play fetch for hours, if you are game!\n\n Utah is doofy but would do better as an only dog or in a home with another playful submissive dog.\n\n Utah also LOVES the water. He very much enjoys the doggy play pool and will be an excellent swimmer if you have a regular pool. He is super playful so he needs a family willing to give him a good amount of attention and play time that he requires. He is a bigger boy, so he will do best in a home with lots of room to roam and a larger sized yard to run.\n\n He also likes to be a lazy couch hog at times too. He loves Netflix marathons and snuggling with his human buddy while he chews on a toy.\n\n He is crate trained (but doesn't love it), housebroken, and is learning basic obedience commands.\n\n Utah is extremely food motivated and will learn any trick you want to teach him! He could be the next skate boarder!\n\n Utah will do best in a home with older kids, as he is a larger dog and could have a tendency to knock little ones down accidentally. If you would like to meet UTAH, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com or email us for more info at info@underdogaz.com\n\n  \n\n If you would like to meet this dog, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or email info@underdogaz.com",

Needs an interactive family and patient training. Loves to romp with doggie friends and may like to go jogging with a human! Hank (on right) is a Yellow Lab Mix - 11/2 to 2 years old - a medium size - Great with doggie friends! He too needs some basic training and patient trusting hands. We think someone didn't have patience with hank as he was going through puppyhood and would get frustrated and miss handle him. So he needs to regain trust that you are not calling him to yell or push or hit him. He is learning that no matter why we are calling him our hands are gentle and kind! He is a naturally sweet boy! Happy Jack is a Beagle Mix - 5 years old - He is super with doggie friends! Has a tendency to actually gravitate to dogs more than people. He is an amazing dog that lived in a community on his own for 41/2 years! He was finall trapped and found his way to SFA. You can't ask for a sweeter boy. No aggression ever! He just needs patient humans! \nWe do recommend if you are serious about adopting to submit our SFA consideration form prior to visiting! This also helps facilitate the adoption process and allows the form to go to the adoption counselor for the animal you are interested in adopting! The proper counselor can then answer your questions via email! Thank you! \nVisit  www.solutionsforanimals.org  for Consideration Form! (The petfinder form is NOT our Consideration Form and may delay response time)",

            "description": "Est DOB: 02/01/14\n\n Approx weight: 25lbs\n\n Blakey is an absolutely adorable dog who was let down badly by his previous owners. They dropped him off at a kill shelter when he was suffering badly from colitis. Blakey was underweight and in a lot of pain. Thankfully we were able to help him.\n\n Blakey does need to be on a special diet and an enzyme powder for the rest of his life, however the enzyme medication is not expensive and the food is no more expensive than a good quality dog food.\n\n Unfortunately previous owners not only let him down when he got sick but also could not be bothered to give him heart worm prevention every month, because of this Blakey is heart worm positive. Thankfully this has been caught early, please do not rule him out because of it. He is on the slow approach to treatment which is not as hard on the dog as other treatment options you may have heard of. We will provide medication for this treatment approach for FREE!\n\n Although Blakey has some health needs, he is a dog that would really bring so much joy to a family. He is gorgeous with an amazingly soft coat, loyal and calm. Crate trained and house trained (although please expect an adjustment period) and has been good with all of the dogs in his foster home, the teenagers in the foster home (when they come home from university) and a visiting 2 year old and baby.\n\n Please consider making this adorable boy a member of your family and contact us to arrange to meet him.\n\n $140 adoption fee includes core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, heart worm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), microchip and registration, spay/neuter, wormer and flea and heart worm prevention while the dog is in our care.",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.\n\n\n\nEcho is a sweet, calm 8 yr old Malamute. She is a small girl, weighing in at only 44lbs. Echo is looking for her bucket list buddy .She had bone cancer in her leg and walked around the streets in NC for several months with her leg broke in several places until she came to us at Wolf Spirit Sled Dog rescue. We had her leg amputated and gave her a year longer to enjoy a happy life. She is at the moment a happy active girl that loves car rides and walks. Her chest x-rays are clear. She is also heart worm positive we are doing the slow-kill treatment on her to rid her of those. She would really like a loving home to call her own for what time she has left. Echo is house broke, doesn't seem to mind cats that i have noticed, doesn't mind other dogs as long as they are gentle. We know how hard it is to lose a friend but she would really love a home of her own.E cho is up to date on her vaccines, dewormed, and microchipped. We will send 6 months of heartworm treatment with her. She will need another heartworm test in 6 months which we will pay for. \n\nIf interested in Echo please contact Debbie at janrose@swva.net",

            "description": "Boiling him down to two words is helpful when learning to understand Roger. Hunting. Dog. Roger embodies pretty much every beautifully rugged characteristic of a textbook hunting dog, including a need to be understood, appreciated, and supported of his uncommon combination of strengths (so he can stay out of trouble!). Adventurous, hard-working, and trusting --- with a couple dashes of goofiness --- is a good way to begin unpacking this sophisticated yet simple (and special) pooch.\n\nRoger is a smart guy with an amazingly sensitive nose. Of course, this is popular amongst hunting breeds, but what makes Roger different is his work ethic --- Roger LOVES to earn his kudos! Responsive to verbal praise, Roger's spirit gently lights up when he's caught doing something right. This is an important component for Roger's future --- his need to work and earn. If not given a regular \"job\", Roger is likely at risk of making one up on his own, which often backfires. He is also a confident, healthy guy who, while somewhat dominant in his personality, doesn't need a lot to gain his loyalty to follow you yet needs a strong leader.\n\nWe don't know too much about his first few years of life, but he does seem to have a few symptoms of being mistreated at one time. He sometimes winces with certain hand motions. However, after spending a little bit of time with him focused on shoring up his strengths, you can almost see him slowly begin to relax and trust. It's actually quite an endearing process.\n\nRoger will thrive in a home who wants to genuinely \"rescue\" him --- take him under his wing, learn his nuances and needs, and commit to helping him unfold in the wake of a confusing context. Because of his understandable prey drive, Roger needs a home with no cats or small animals in the home. A fenced yard will probably be helpful, but not required. An interest in nurturing his \"nose skill\" is highly encouraged. Second dog is possible and will be considered case-by-case after a dog introduction. Adult only home (no children).\n\nContact the front office today to schedule an appointment only Trainer Meet-N-Greet.",

            "description": "PLEASE SHARE!??\n\nI\u2019ve dreaded writing this post but here we go. \n\n**Tugger is a 5 year old Catahoula mix, he is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and ready to finally find his forever family! He is adoptable through Furever Buddy's Dog Rescue and his adoption fee is $100 (but if I find the right family I will gladly pay his fee)**\n\nI have been fostering Tugger for around 8 months, I would 100% adopt him if I could but it\u2019s just not feasible right now. We are moving and unfortunately he isn\u2019t allowed to come, I need to find different placement for him soon. Whether it\u2019s an adopter or foster through Furever Buddy's Dog Rescue or another rescue placement, he needs to find a place to go. \nAs many of you know Tugger was rescued from a hoarding situation at 7 months old back in 2016, he sat in a kennel for over THREE YEARS before I finally took him home as a foster. \nTugger has a bite history but it is not extensive and all were provoked. Since he\u2019s been with me he has bitten three times. \nHe nipped at a small child who was running around the corner and startled him, it didn\u2019t break skin just bruised. \nA few months later he bit a teenage girl who was walking him and she tripped slightly and ran into him which resulted in two separate bites neither of which broke skin (just tore her clothing). \nThe most recent one was when my dad (whom Tugger is unfamiliar with) was holding his leash and started waving his arms to get someone\u2019s attention and Tugger jumped up and grabbed his shirt resulting in some scratches on the skin and a ripped shirt but nothing serious. \n\nTugger is still uneasy about being touched even by me sometimes but he has never even attempted to bite me. ?I have been able to give him baths, put his harnesses on, and pick him up to load him in cars without issues. He is fine with being touched by a number of my friends and family. He does not want to hurt people, he is not aggressive in any way. He is fear reactive. \n\nHe would do best in a home experienced with dog behavior and training, he can co exist with small children but I wouldn\u2019t recommend a home with kids under 12 for him. \n\nTugger loves to play fetch and is treat motivated. He still hasn\u2019t been able to figure out learning tricks yet but someday I\u2019m sure he will get there. He loves picking out his toys at tractor supply/ petco, he likes to \u201cde-fluff\u201d all his toys and rip the squeakers out. He keeps a clean kennel, rarely rips his beds or blankets up, and eats 5 cups of food morning and night. \n\nTugger walks well on a leash, does well with other dogs but isn\u2019t a huge fan of pushy dominant dogs, he needs to be supervised with cats and chickens. \n\nHe gets the CUTEST zoomies whenever he gets fed, gets to go for a car ride, plays fetch, watches a leaf blow away, or literally any other time he gets excited about anything?\n\nHe does great off leash once he knows you, he\u2019ll gladly go in any house or car and make himself at home as long as he has his person. He attaches to one person more than anyone else and he\u2019ll trust you with anything once you\u2019re that person. \n\nHe loves car rides just make sure you don\u2019t over feed him before a long one??. He listens to corrections very well and has done great on an e-collar for recall training! \n\nTugger is such a great dog, he loves to run and hike. He\u2019s always up for an adventure. Wildlife doesn\u2019t phase him, he just wants to stay with his person. \n\nPLEASE contact me at (435)-401-5037 with any questions regarding Tuggy! I\u2019m happy to answer any questions I can!",

            "description": "Once again, PAWS has stepped up to help with several amazing dogs retired from a breeding operation. They are the sweetest dogs and will make amazing companions. They are a little unsure of their surroundings right now as their human contact has been limited, but they are sweet beyond belief. Adopters must understand that dogs from these types of facilities have had little interaction with people and it will take time and patience for them to understand and develop their connection with their family.  It will be worth the effort.  \n\nAfter over 3 years in a home, Chase and the older resident canine decided they were no longer friends.  Perhaps Chase was being a bit mean after the other dog lost his vision.   Chase is again available for adoption.  He is now about 6 years old.  He may do best as an only dog.\n\n3 year old Chase is such a sweet, kissy little guy which is unusual for the boys.  He'll be an amazing addition to some lucky adopter's home.\nChase will be vaccinated, neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.  Any dental work needed in the opinion of our vet will be done as well.  Chase's adoption fee is $200.\nPAWS has added the H3N2 flu vaccine to its shot protocol.  Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake.  Depending on how long they're here with us, they may received a second vaccination but if adopted right away, we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297.  We do applications in person or over the phone.  You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.",

She is 9 years old and has been in and out of the shelter several times in the last 4 years. She is your typical chi, loving, needy, friendly lap dog, on her terms! she does not care to be man handled or to have her space invaded. I met her at the shelter and she let me scoop her up and take her for a walk, she loves to go for walks! And boy does she need it, she is VERY over weight! She probably weighs 11 lbs and should weigh 8lbs. She will need someone who understands her quirks and a home with no children or visiting children under the age of 13 to ensure they are old enough to respect her space. Today her new life starts! Also her new diet.\n\nPlease check back as we learn more about Dolly\n\n\nPlease email Angela (areeves13@hotmail.com) for information about Dolly.",

She will bark when she needs to go outside.  She is enjoying this cooler weather but loves to be inside with her foster parents.  She would do best in a home with a dog her size or larger that is submissive to her, as she thinks she should be \u201ctop dog\u201d in the home.  She would also do well as an only dog.  She is about 65 lbs, so she is not as large as a purebred Saint Bernard.  We don\u2019t know what she is mixed with.  She likes children and would do well with older children.\nMuffin  is in a foster home in Wichita, Kansas and will not be shipped. Requirements to adopt Muffin are as follows: Her adopter will have to be in the Wichita Metro area or surrounding area; no out-of-state adopters because we need to do a home visit. A secure fenced yard is a must; invisible fences not acceptable. A veterinarian reference is required showing that your present/past pets are up-to-date on shots, spayed/neutered and on heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $200.00.

She adores treats and tennis balls and sitting inside our tiny visitors cottage.  She loves the toys in there and the fluffy bed and the little ottoman we sit on side by side.  We spend a lot of time talking with her about the weather or our week or the obvious fact she is the best good girl.  Brandy has been waiting years for a home, largely because she needs the right fit. And adult home with a strong routine would be optimal.  She loves playing fetch and is excellent at it.  Brandy is a tripod, but she has no idea she has any limitations, so please, please don't tell her she is any different from any other playful, graceful, athletic dog. Brandy likes other dogs but tanked rather miserably on her cat test.  She needs an adult home, preferably with someone who can work with her and help her adjust to life outside of the shelter, which is all she has known for a while.",

She was given up because her owners did not have the know-how or time to devote to raising a big, high energy puppy. \n\nRhea is a very dominant, energetic, and smart Doberman. She is pushy with other dogs and tends to do best with dominant male dogs or very social male dogs that can put up with her. \n\nRhea was adopted, but was returned because she was aggressive towards the cats in the household and she nipped at a couple of people. Rhea needs an experienced Doberman owner that can give her the mental and physical exercise that she needs. She is very athletic and would be a good candidate for agility, nose works, obedience or some other dog sport where she could expend her energy and talents. \n\nRhea is crate-trained and housebroken. She was born in October of 2016.",

            "description": "Reading, PA ---\nJazmine is a beautiful 5-6 year old, 65 lb. female pit bull with a rich caramel-colored coat and absolutely spectacular ears. A very intelligent and lovable girl, Jazmine is fully housebroken and knows all of her basic commands, including give-paw, and she even sits upright when you give her the command \u201cUppies\u201d and will stay that way to pose for a photo! She is a strong, athletic pup who loves going on walks, she especially loves to play fetch with a ball, and even prefers to have her feet cleaned after playing outside \u2014 a tomboy yet a true girly-girl! She loves to bond with her humans and is super generous with hugs and kisses. This lovely lady needed some help learning appropriate behaviors so she was sent to doggy rehabilitation and recently graduated with flying colors! Now, she\u2019s waiting for a new Foster or Adopter so she can leave her training facility. \n\n***** Here\u2019s what her TRAINERS have to say:\n\u201cJasmine has learned so much and is excited to find her very own home that can continue all the work she started. She has learned how to share her toys and space with others, play with male and female dogs, and walk nicely on a leash. As she loves to exercise, Jazmine would thrive in an athletic home that will provide healthy outlets for her energy by giving her long walks, hikes, or even run or bike with her! Now she is looking for a home with experienced owners of guardian-breed dogs who can provide the disciplined leadership that she needs to help her maintain her new stable, relaxed, confident behavior in a calm, structured, and balanced environment in which she can excel. A home with either similarly-sized dogs or where she can be an only dog would be best (no small dogs or cats). She enjoys playing with her canine companions and loves a good game of chase and some body checking that would make the NHL proud! Due to her size and activity level, a home with no young children would be best. Her new home should be a patient one that is willing to provide an adjustment period where she is given the opportunity to properly acclimate and learn the people, rules, pets, and new environment while building a foundation of trust and confidence in her new \u2018pack-leader/s\u2019. After all the hard work that Jazzy has put into working on her new behaviors, she is so excited to finally find a new foster - or preferably her own adopter - who is ready to start this journey together.\u201d \n\n******* PLEASE NOTE: The wonderful team who worked hard with Jazmine has graciously offered to provide training guidance and assistance to her new family throughout the transition period to help ensure her continued success. Help us reward her for all of her hard work by getting her into a new home ASAP! She is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, spayed and ready to find her forever home. \n\n----- If you are interested in opening your heart and home to Jazmine for FOSTER or ADOPT, please contact mastiffmojo@msn.com or 484-220-0418 and please be sure to complete our application online at www.almosthomeanimalsanctuary.com.

            "description": "Hi my name is Harvey! I\u2019m about 3.5 years old and currently weigh 50lbs. I am working on my New Year's resolution to lose 5 more pounds.\n\nMy report card from doggie daycare: (see video of me playing)\nCharming, confident, playful, and sooo cute!  Harvey is an amazing daycare dog.  He channels his inner working dog and absolutely loves burning off his energy by chasing his friends around the yard.  His play style is perfect and fits with every dog he makes friends with.  He is an attention seeker and loves nudging staff to get all the head rubs and ear scratches throughout the day.  Harvey is going to make a family extremely happy that they adopted him.\n\nHarvey's best fit:\nI really love women pack leaders.  I'm looking for an active family that will help keep me fit and give me lots of outlets for physical and mental stimulation - I am a working dog after all.  Potential jobs for me could be herding livestock, daily walks or runs, chasing balls or frisbees, or doing fun dog sports like agility. I have good recall and know basic commands. I love going to doggie daycare and burning off my energy.  Harvey has amazing potty manners and will just need to get acclimated to his new home and your routine.\n\nHarvey's needs:\nI will need a strong pack leader to give me direction and correct me when I need it. I would do well in a home with another active, playful dog and in a home that has kids aged middle to high school that could actively participate in my care. I also tend to prefer females over males.  Sometimes I get fearful of men and I might growl, but this doesn't happen with all men.\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website!\n\nHope to see you soon!\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events. Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.\nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt.\nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience. Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer\n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

            "description": "Meet Maryann! She is a 6 year old Min Pin who came from a hoarding situation. She has had a tough past but is ready to meet her furever family! Maryann enjoys being with other dogs and would prefer a home with them but it's not a requirement. She is a shy girl who enjoys her personal space unless she has had time to feel comfortable around you. Her foster mom respects Maryann's space and as a reward, Maryanne will ask her for head scratches from time to time but it did take her a while to trust her foster mom. She will only ask for head scractchs in you are sitting or laying down. She will run if you are standing up. If you stop giving her attention, she'll gently touch you with her paw to ask for more! Silly pup. A calm, quiet home would be best for this little lady and she would absolutely love potty pads or a fenced yard to roam in during potty breaks as leashes scare her. Her favorite thing in the whole world is food...and you will gain her heart by giving her treats. When it is time for dinner she circles and barks because she is so excited. Who doesn't love a good meal?! Maryanne really deserves a loving family of her own! She came from a hoarding case of 67 dogs who were living in their own feces. Her past was sad and dark but her future could be very bright with you!\n\nThe adoption fee for this pretty girl is $175. She has been spayed, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Maryann? Submit an adoption application via the link below and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if shes the right match for you!",

Spirit is a double merle, a type of pattern that results in blindness or deafness in dogs.  Even though she can't hear, she is incredibly adaptive and is absolutely dedicated to the art of fun!  She loves to play catch, chase balls, bring the ball back to you, and toss it to you too!  Spirit also loves walks and will keep up with your pace and adventuring.   She is very bossy, typical of her breed, and we are looking for someone with breed experience so that she can live her very best life!  Spirit takes a medication for arthritis pain relief and also takes joint support supplements daily as well!  \n\nYOU CAN SPONSOR SPIRIT'S CARE IN RESCUE BY CLICKING ON THE SPONSOR BUTTON ON THIS PAGE or DIRECTLY ON THE RESCUE'S WEBSITE: www.onmywayhomerescue.com.

He is a very large dog  and weighs about 86 lbs and his pictures do not do him justice  He is gentle, very well mannered and calm and walks well on a leash.  He is calm inside and does very well.  He enjoys relaxing inside on a blanket or couch.. He really prefers laying around rather than a lot of activity.  He is 6-7 years old .  He does struggle with arthritis in his back legs/hips but it really does not bother him much unless he takes really long walks. He really just prefers to be pet and lay around in his senior years. He would love to be your friend!   We always take the fur babies back into our care if for any reason it does not work out.\n\n\nNOTE FOR RINGO STAR IF YOU LIVE OUT OF STATE TRANSPORTATION TO YOUR LOCATION IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE WITH AN APPROVED HOME STUDY/APPLICATION.  PLEASE INQUIRE IF INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT MORE AND WE CAN CONTACT PET TRANSPORTERS TO GET A QUOTE FOR YOU.",

Margo is a total cutie pie who is sweet as can be and the kind of dog you can't help but feel happy around because her personality is so joyful.  She is about 4 years old and weighs 50 pounds.  She has been here for a long time and would love a home of her own with people that would love her for the rest of her life. She was found as a lost doggie.  She is a hound with beautiful markings.  Margo is spayed, housebroken, up to date with her vaccinations, micro-chipped, and heartworm negative.  She knows the commands of sit, stay, and lay down and walks nicely on a leash.\n\nMargo came from a high kill shelter in Georgia where.her time was almost up.  She is a high energy dog who loves to play and run around in the yard with the other dogs.  She is wonderful with people or dogs.  We don't know how she is with cats.  She has shown no aggression since coming here and only seems to have a loving, sweet nature for anyone who comes her way.  \n\nWe think she would be fine with older children but because of her energy level may accidentally knock young children down.  Margo loves to play with her toys, including balls, tugs and hard bones; which she loves to bite on.  \n\nBecause Margo is a high energy dog a fenced yard would be a must so she would be able to run around and be safe and secure.  \n\nIf u think Margo might fit in your family, please call Judi at (908) 510-8721 or send me an application for her.

She is a white, female, pointer/shepherd mix dog with brown spots on her ears and very pale brown spots on her fur.  She is a very unique looking dog.  Buffy is approximately \n5 years old, 50 pounds, housebroken, up to date on her vaccinations, spayed, micro-chipped and heartworm negative.  She also has the most gorgeous white eye lashes. Buffy \nknows how to sit and will do so when asked.  She is a little shy but loves giving and getting love. She is so sweet and loving. \n\nBuffy came from a kill shelter in Georgia where her time was almost up.  Since coming into rescue she has shown no aggression but only sweetness.  She is a high energy dog who loves to play with her toys, including balls and hard bones which she loves to bite on.  She takes her treats very gently.  We believe that she would be great with children, but care should be taken with  young children who could be knocked over by accident through play.  \n\nBuffy is fine and friendly with most other dogs and enjoys running around and playing with them here.  A secure fenced yard would be important for this dog so she could run safely free.  We don't know how she is with cats.  Buffy is so loving and sweet and is so deserving of a loving home. Please give her a chance.  She has been waiting for a long time. \n\nIf u think Buffy might be a good match for your family,  please send an application to Save Us Dog Rescue at fries3@aol.com   Buffy is so deserving of a forever, loving home. If u would like to talk to me about her, please call Judi at (908) 510-8721.",

He is a super happy dog, never met a stranger, loves to go to the vet, the grocery store, the dry cleaners, and all other places.  He is very short and stumpy but very thick and fat on his short and stumpy legs. He is selective with his dog friends and seems to prefer the ladies. \nHe does not lack for self-confidence and considers himself to be a pretty terrific guy.  Junior is very good about not pottying in his kennel and does his best to hold it for outside exercise time.  Junior is one of those silly dogs who makes you giggle because of his physical appearance and is silly demeanor.  Please ask about an application for him today!",

She had emergency surgery in December of 2017 to repair a herniated disc that was causing her severe discomfort and pain. She has recovered well but because of this she needs a home with very few or no stairs. \nShe still loves to run and play even after her surgery so a home with a fenced-in yard is a must. \n\nBabs needs a home with no other pets due to her surgery. One wrong move while playing could completely reverse all of the repairs that were made. She loves to get pets and rubs. \n\nCould you be Babs' peanut butter to her jelly?",

The conditions werent the best to say the least and oh yeah, I was SUPER pregnant. Not a good place for a expecting mom. Thankfully, I was taken from there just in time and was able to have my puppies in a foster home. I was even thrown a huge baby shower by a ton of people who follow SNARR! I was so happy to finally have had my babies and be out of the shelter but my excitement quickly became tragedy. Not long after giving birth, almost half of my babies passed away- only 4 survived. \nNow that my remaining pups have gone to live their own liveshere I sit and wait. While I adore my foster mom, I want a home to call my own. \nIm confused on why I dont have my own home yet Im incredibly adorable and Im hands down the most wiggly tushed pocket pittie youll ever meet! I have never met a person I didnt like, however dogs.not too fond of dogs or any other furry little creatures. I blame that on my high prey drive and Im very smart when it comes down to it- I can be a pro stalker and Im lightning fast so its best that the temptation isnt there in forever home. Give me any kind of human though and its nothing but hugs (literally, I give hugs) and kisses! \nDue to having allergies, I take Benedryl and cannot eat chicken.\n\nTransport to any approved home within the US can be provided at no additional fee\nCurrently Skyy is located in Lawrenceville, Georgia.\n\n\nPlease visit SNARRANIMALRESCUE.org to fill out an adoption application and our adoption requirements/process can also be found there!",

            "description": "FRANK THE TANK is now heartworm free and looking for a home. We are seeking a longhaul truck driver for him or someone who is home most of the day. Frank absolutely loves to ride. If the truck door is open he is ready to ride..... When we first got Frank he suffered terribly from separation anxiety. I don't know if it had anything to do with the circumstances of how he was found. ( Someone had tied him to a light pole in a rural part of the parish.) Fortunately time and lots of love has taught him he can trust us to come back. He now can be kenneled for 4 or 5 hours during the day and all night long without any problems! He needs a non rural environment. He delights in defeathering my roosters and chasing the domestic rabbits until they die of fright. He is good with the cats, other dogs, and people.- just not chickens or rabbits.   He also loves kids!  \n\nFrank is approximately 6 years old and currently weighs around 80 pounds.  \n\nFrank is up for adoption through Swampy Paws and his adoption fee is $200 which includes all vaccinations, dewormer, flea/heartworm prevention, heartworm treatment, vet check and neuter. \n\nA fenced yard and home visit are REQUIRED to adopt. \n\nFor more info call 225-772-8836 or email swampypaws4@yahoo.com",

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.",

She came to us with her friend Taye Diggs and would have to find a home with him as they are a bonded pair.\n\n***CHECK OUT TAYE DIGGS FOR HIS INFORMATION***\n\nCoco has a grade 5 out of 6 heart murmur. She is on a daily medication and doesn't seem bothered in any way. She loves to run and play but getting love is her favorite.\n\nCoco is around 8 years old as of 05/10/2017\n\nMost of our contact is via email so please keep an eye on your inbox, junk and spam folders.\n\nIf you would like to meet this special dog, please email dogs@lunashouse.org to set up an appointment. Please be patient to hear from us as we are all volunteers and may not be able to respond immediately.\n\nOur volunteers make sure just the right home is chosen for me so they require a home visit. You must live within a 50 mile radius of our location in order to be considered.\n\nThe adoption fee for a pair of dogs is $400 and includes vaccines, flea prevention treatment, neuter/spay, and micro chipping. Like us on Facebook!!\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs in unreliable, for most of our dogs we are making the best guess at what the predominant breed or breed mix might be. We get to know each dog as an individual and do our best to describe each dog based on personality and temperament, not breed label.",

He loves people, he is house trained, well behaved on the leash and around the house.\nChai is dog selective, getting along best mostly with females, and he would be good around older calmer cats. Because of his size and rough play, he would do best with adults only. He is a lover and can be a great companion but someone with experience would be better.\nChai enjoys long walks, being outdoor in the sun and spending his time with the people he loves. Whoever meets him is very impressed by his sweet personality and his playful joyful affection, but he can also be a bit mouthy when over excited. We recommend a very quiet and experienced home for him, someone who can be firm and assertive because in fact responds better to men than women and we have noticed that he needs a strong personality to keep him calm and well behaved.\nChai is always ready to go with you on your next adventure or just to be in the sun. A beautiful adult dog of about 70 lbs he just needs a stable home.",

He is a strong boy with a lot of spunk and sometimes doesn't realize his size when he's barreling around. Because of this, we'd prefer a home without small kids. He is a sweet boy, he's just still working on personal space and boundaries. \n\nCreed is 4 years old and is completely vetted meaning he is neutered, vaccinated, HW-, microchipped and on monthly flea/tick/heart worm prevention. \n\nHe has a lot of potential to grow into a well rounded family dog, he just needs someone ready to continue polishing him to help him shine! \n\nCreed enjoys chewing his nylabones, going for car rides, and getting belly rubs. He really enjoys chasing his ball around the yard, and finding big sticks to carry and chew on. \n\nThis handsome fellas personality is as big as his head, and we can't wait to see what lucky person or people make him theirs forever! \n\nTo meet Creed, please first submit an application at mercysdoorpetrescue.org. This is the first step in the adoption process. If meet and greets are successful, we place the dogs on a trial adoption for two weeks to see how they settle in, and ensure they are the right fit. \n\nIf you think Creed might be a good match for you, please submit your application at www.mercysdoorpetrescue.org. His adoption fee is $175.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Chandler, and my foster mom and I are looking for my VERY OWN forever home. Let me tell you about myself. I am past the puppy stages, and I have Level 1 Basic Training experience. I know SIT, WAIT, SHAKE, ROLL OVER, DOWN, PLAY DEAD, and I'm eager to learn even more! My foster mom says it will be very important for my new owner to reinforce training practice in my new home to keep my skills sharp. This is fun for me, too, since I love to work for treats! She can give you lots of tips on how to do this.\nI am HOUSE TRAINED and CRATE TRAINED, and keeping me in my crate when unsupervised in my new home will help me to be my BEST self. I really enjoy CHEW TOYS, like maybe a KONG or DEER ANTLER to keep me busy when we are not going on adventures together. After our activities, I would love to share a CUDDLE or two! One thing to note is that I can get very excited when I know we're going for a walk or a car ride, so using CALM, ASSERTIVE leadership at those times is very important. \nAn IDEAL HOME for me is one where I can be included in lots of activities, get daily exercise, and be the only KING in the CASTLE. I would do best as an ONLY DOG, and in a home with NO CHILDREN, since they can be too much for me. However, it is possible that I can live in a home with a CAT, if we are introduced SLOWLY. A yard would be great, but please MONITOR ME CLOSELY, to be sure I don't try to be an escape artist, since my foster mom does not have a fenced yard. One last thing that would help me to be the BEST BOY EVER please be patient with me as I meet all of the people in your household, as well as friends. I'm the kind of guy who needs some TLC in new situations, but once I'm comfortable, I'll soak up all the attention you can give. \nIf you think we might be a PAWFECT MATCH, or have any questions, please email my foster mom at stephanie331@yahoo.com. You can also see me in action on my own YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/\nOr my very own Facebook page, Chandler the unwanted pit bull. You can see me and all my adventures.

Our beauty queen is shy in new situations, and so she needs a home with lot\u2019s of love and patience. Quinn would do well in almost any home, though she prefers older kids and she has so much love to give. In addition to being a gentle soul, Quinn keeps her kennel clean, and is working on basic commands. Consider meeting this 4 year old sweetheart. Your heart will melt. \n\nQuinn is slow to warm up but once she does, she loves unconditionally.  She had a female best friend who was adopted and we haven't been able to pair her with a new friend since.  \n\nWe prefer older/no kids since she is slow to warm up to new people.\n\nQuinn\u2019s adoption fee is $300 which includes her spay, microchip, fecal exam, and vaccinations up to date. \n\nPlease note:  \n\n= All dogs require a $100 training deposit. Once confirmation of the completion of a training class has been sent to the rescue, you will receive your deposit back in full.\n\n = When emailing please include your phone number to help speed up the adoption process. \n\n= For the safety of our dogs, we only adopt within a 2 hour radius from Joliet to allow our volunteers to do home checks, if necessary.",

This beautiful dog was found sitting on a good person's porch after just having puppies -- she had begged countless others for help but finally found a safe place. Her puppies were believed to be sold by the person who dumped her after using her to make money. Do you see why we love bully breeds?\nDahlia has a very sensitive nature and just wants to be near her person. She prefers a calm environment. She likes to cuddle and give kisses. And Dahlia loves to eat! She's a smart dog; eager to please. She's practicing basic obedience and leash manners. Dahlia is always looking to her human leader for guidance; we try to remind her every single day how truly wonderful she is -- and we know she will learn even more in a dedicated home. To see this dog smile is a priceless gift.\n\nDahlia is about 50 pounds; born 2014. Dahlia would do best in a home as the only pet.\nShe's spayed, current on routine vaccinations, microchipped and heartworm negative. To learn more about Dahlia and her progress in our rehabilitation program, email SacredPawsDogs@gmail.com\nAdoption fee $150",

He has been use to living in a truck with his owner and seems ok in a kennel but would not do well in a crate.  Too confining. Don't really think  he would need a crate. Hermes does not like cats so small dogs might be iffy.\nTo adopt Hermes you must live in Jacksonville. Have a vet reference, a fenced yard,   NO EXCEPTIONS\n\n\n\nHermes is a very sweet and playful boy, he loves attention and smuggling. He doesn't bite and hardly ever barks though,, If he feels like he is being ignored, he'll place himself where you can see him and turn his back on you, peeking over his shoulder to make sure you notice.\n He is house trained and is excellent about holding it. The only issues is when taking him out to potty, he needs to be walked near trees and bushes, he just won't go on grass if being walked, he also doles it out slowly, needing several bushes or trees to empty himself out.\n; \n; He seems good with other dogs and would probably love having someone to play with.  He might be okay with cats, but he might want to play when they don't want to, ; \n; Though he is mostly Lab, he doesn't seem to like water much, doesn't like getting his baths either, though hell be okay once you start.\n; \n; He loved his squeeky pheasant plush toy and loves little mice made for cats, he tosses them in the air and tries to catch them.\n Loves being called Happy Puppy; and ;good boy .\n;  \n; He is great with a vacuum going in the room, is okay with thunder.\n \n;  ; \n  He seems good with kids too, sort of indifferent really, but not scared or agitated at all.\n; \n  He loves having his neck and chest rubbed too.... \n \n  .\n \n; \n 904-887-3018",

For this reason, he would do best being adopted by a person who is familiar with the breed.\nCruiz would not do well in a busy house with a revolving door of people coming in & out.

This older boy is super-sweet and loves to cuddle but still has a very independent side to him. When he prefers some quiet time, he will simply grab one of his toys (which he LOVES) and go lay down on his bed. When he's ready for some more love he will come find you, no matter where you are. \n\nHe does seem to really like \"his stuff\" so he would prefer a home with older, respectful children. Rusty will roll over for belly rubs any time, any place. Rusty would do best in a home without cats or small dogs. \n\nCould you be Rusty's snuggle buddy?",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING PRINCESS, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE FACEBOOK PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nPrincess is the sweetest 8 year old Labrador retriever mix that was chained at an abandoned house until we rescued her. Princess does have epilepsy and requires medications to prevent seizures. She loves being around people. Princess knows her basic commands. She doesn't mind having a bath. Princess does well with playful good natured dogs. She has lived with cats several years ago and did ok. She has not been with cats recently. She is not only beautiful but extremely loving and smart. Our little girl knows how cute she is and will stick her tongue out when she is being silly. She is very people friendly. Princess likes to play ball and cuddle on the couch or be anywhere you want to shower her with hugs and kisses. Her forever home must have a fenced yard so she can safely hang out with her people and sun herself. Children 7 years old or older. Princess is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on heartworm preventative as well as house trained. Princess would be a great fit for any couple or family.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Princess' adoption fee is $275.",

Micha has good manners inside, crate trained, and loves to run free (fenced in yard only).\n\nUpdate: 2020 - Micha has reached the elder stage.

We consider Gus one of the Love Dogs \"HOMIES\" because he has some behavior quirks that can be easily misinterpreted... He often tells us how to act around him haha! \n\nHe loves meeting new dog pals and spends most of his time in playgroup with his best dog buddy Savannah or hanging out in the office with his favorite human Michelle. Treadmill, play time, group walks, hikes.. Gus is keen for adventure, he is curious, smart and eager! He also has amazing obedience skills and loves to show them off during our many workshops! If you give the command \"go to your mat\", Gus pops right over to his mat and lays down until you release him. One of his favorite commands! \n\nGus is loyal as loyal as a dog can get and sometimes his strong protection instinct can run into trouble if he's protecting someone or something that doesn't need to be protected.. if you know what i mean. Gus thinks it's his job to keep watch over his human peeps.. once you're in his circle though, you bet he'll stand by your side!  Even though Gus is a Homie, we don't believe he is \"un-adoptable\". All it takes is understanding and dedication to seeing Gus for who HE is and he can happily live in a home that appreciates his loyalty and respects him.",

            "description": "Looking for a devoted friend?  Finn is the dog for you!  He loves people, going for car rides, and walks.  He is in search of a new home through no fault of his own.  He was returned to rescue when his owners' living situation changed and they were no longer able to keep him. Originally he was surrendered to a shelter because his owner bred beagles and he and the stud beagle got into a fight.   Finn can be dog selective, but has done fine on extended visits with male and female dogs smaller than he is.  He is too interested in cats, so a home without a cat would be best.  He LOVES people and getting attention. Finn likes cuddling too.   He does not need to be crated when you are gone. Finn is willing to follow commands and is eager to please. He was born in October of 2015.  He enjoys getting attention and loves being petted and brushed.  \n\nFinn will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges to  a secure visibly fenced  yard.  Pyrs do not do well with wireless fencing.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine.  Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds.  They are bred to be independent thinkers.\n\nAdopters must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old.   If you are interested in fostering or adopting Finn, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org\n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption. In fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed.  You provide good quality food,  grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program.  You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nAdoption fee is $350\n",

            "description": "Abbie is a 6 year old Boxer/Great Pyrenees mix that is looking for her forever home. She is super sweet and loving. \n\nShe came in to the rescue after just giving birth to 6 puppies. She wasn't able to feed the litter after just a few days so the puppies had to be taken away and bottle fed. She was such a good mom that it was really hard to see her missing them. It appears that this was one of many litters that this big girl has had in her short life.\n \nI'm not sure that she has been abused but I don't think she has been cared for either and suspect that she may have spent a lot of time outside in a kennel. She is now an inside girl and loving every minute of it. She is crate and house trained.\n\nAbbie just graduated from the \"New Leash on Life\" program where she spent time being trained the basic commands. She did great with all her training except leash and she is a puller at times. She will also sit and shake hands.\n\nShe is not good with cats so it's best if she has a home without them. She is not aggressive with other dogs but if they push or get in her face she will fight back.\n\nAdoption Fee $150.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo adopt this animal or one of his/her orphaned friends, just fill out our online application.\n\nPlease note, we do not ship animals for any reason.  All adopters must travel to Marion, North Carolina to pick up their animals.",

            "description": "FABULOUS Emmett is a Bull terrier/Staffordshire terrier mix and is approximately 4 years young, and is one of our favorite dogs! He is so handsome! A real show stopper!  One of the coolest dogs ever! He is very even tempered, plays great with other dogs, and walks nicely on a leash. He would make a great family member who wants to lay around and be snuggled and play.\nHe hasn't been noticed  for awhile so we just made sure we riposted his petfinder add. HE IS AN AWESOME DOG!!\n He would love to go hiking, to the beach, camping, walking and car rides. Emmett is up to date on vaccines, neutered, and micro-chipped.  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an application today.

She's high energy and learning to be on leash, but has her moments.  Now, if you are experienced, the excitement is not vicious, just can't contain her excitement and gets a little crazy.  I love her!  So happy!!\n\n She loves People and Kids, and is so happy to have the attention at adoption day!  I've never been a fan of Dog Parks - she should not go...if you have a fenced in back yard, kids, she's a great dog.  She loves her toys and balls, and the attention from all people and kids!!\n\nFor more information:  Julie cell 770-329-4742 - or email for application:  jachambers4806@yahoo.com  \n\nPet Adoptions:  Sat. 2-6 pm - call ahead for location and attendance.",

            "description": "Canis is 35 pounds of pure love and sweetness! She found us on a cold morning in March 2009 when she was discovered in a cat carrier in our horse tack room. We took her in to the vet where she was checked over and spayed. She tested positive for heartworms AND had a dislocated hip (probably due to being hit by a car.) It's been an interesting few months for Canis having first successfully completed heartworm treatment then had her hip repaired. Dr. Milton in Birmingham performed an FHO (Femoral Head Ostectomy) which is a very sucessful procedure. Canis loves people and does fine with other dogs also. Her tail never stops wagging! We believe she is the perfect candidate for therapy dog training.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This dog is crate trained, spayed or neutered, up to date on shots and HW negative.  Adoption application, home visit, and $50 adoption fee are required.  Please read our adoption requirements on our home page.  Many of your questions can be answered here. We welcome your phone call, but for a faster response, it is best to email us your specific questions.  After reviewing GSRCA\u2019s adoption process, please fill out the application completely. INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS CANNOT BE PROCESSED!  This is the first step in our adoption process. No adoption will be considered or discussed until the application has been received.\n\nClick here to fill out an application  Thank you for considering a rescued German Shepherd dog!",

He is not aggressive or mean in any way but he thinks he is still a puppy and his manners need some more training.\nGalileo would love a family who does outdoor activities, he loves the woods and the water. He is easy to train, smart and attentive but he just need your time, structure and love.\nGalileo is a really handsome, a big stunning dog that bonds to people well. He loves playing fetch, lived with a small dog and he is strong on the leash but walks very well if you use a harness. We recommend a quiet environment without too many stimulation around him to help him relax and settle.\nHis ideal person should be an experienced, firm but calm one so he can feel safe, learn the rules and behave at his best.",

House-trained and intelligent, Brandie already knows her basic commands and is eager to  please. This sweet and playful girl needs a confident, kind and no-nonsense female owner who will set boundaries and who will not provide an overdose of physical affection, which causes Brandie to become overly protective of her owner and aggressive towards outsiders.   She should be the only dog in the family.  Our Miss Agility can jump a 5-foot fence  so a secure environment is important.

He was found with empty bowls which we think was meant for food and water. We have listed him as housetrained as he does very well in a crate but we have not tested him inside a home yet. He will need a 6 foot stockade for his fenced yard and we think he is around 18 months to 2 years in age. He gets along with other dogs once introduced and unknown on cats. He has been neutered, vacs, hwc, and microchipped. His adoption is $200 to help cover the cost of medical. Please visit pbroklahoma.com where you will find an application for this kid!",

But everything is finally all sorted out and she is doing very well.\n\nMayo is currently living with two other similar size dogs but it took a while for her to adapt to them so she will need and experienced owner if she is to live with other pets.  Mayo is also particular about who she gets along with so will need to meet any potential dog siblings in advance.  \n\nMayo is very very sweet and chill, she loves to curl up and cuddle with her people, and get belly rubs.  She loves to pay, and is a pro at tug of war, but most of all she just wants to be around people and all the action.\n\nMayo came from a northern community where she roamed free and sometimes old habits are hard to break so she will require a fenced yard to keep her safe.\n\nMayo has waited a very long time for the right family, we really hope that she finally finds the home she deserves.  \n\nIf you are interested in Mayo please fill out an application on our website earthdogterrierrescue.com\n\n\nADOTION FEES:\nSmall breed dogs: $350.00\nPuppies (under 6 months): $350.00\nAll other dogs: $300.00\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\u2022\tMandatory Spay or Neuter\n\u2022\tUpdate to date on shots\n\u2022\tMicrochip\n\u2022\tTattoo\n\u2022\tRabies\n\u2022\tHeartworm tested\n\u2022\t6 weeks of Pet Insurance\n",

Tootsie rolls over for belly rubs and has a delightful personality. Her tail is always happily wagging. \n\nTootsie knows the command \"sit\" and takes treats gently from your fingers. She is currently being kenneled in Union, Illinois, where she is great with all the other dogs, but not cats! \n\nTootsie is also wonderful with people of all ages. She is very sweet, snugly and loving. She prefers cuddling to playing ball and doesn't seem to have an interest in playing fetch. \n\nTootsie was found stray in Schaumburg, Illinois, and her teeth are all ground down. Perhaps she was chewing on a chain or rocks? She is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. To meet and possibly adopt Tootsie, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net for an adoption application. Her adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. She is extremely healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped and heartworm-tested.",

            "description": "Daisy suffers from seizures due to a head injury before she was given to us.\n\nShe takes phenobarbitol pills 2x a day on a strict schedule as well as potassium bromide.\n\nShe takes comfort in fellow dogs and cats and would do best with a dog in the home.\n\nShe does not like walks or a leash/collar and is independent, not one for cuddling.\n\nShe needs a fenced yard to enjoy and relax and play in.\n\nShe has been in foster care since April 2017 and they know her well so we will not be moving her to a home that's less than ideal that would cause her to digress.\n\nWHY IS THIS DOG IN NEED??- This little girl was surrendered into rescue by her owner \n\nWHERE IS THIS DOG NOW ?- She is fostered in Gorrie \n\n**ALL ABOUT DAISY **\nRequirements;\n- another dog in the home .\n-Fenced yard\n-Adult home due to her level of uncertainty with children. \n-no Small children or visiting small children.\n-someone who is exp with seizure disorder. She is on medication that is inexpensive\n\nShe is very uncertain at times when she has to be cornered to put on a collar/ leash which she currently has a real fear of. \nHer foster uses a harness to access her as needed with a leash attached.\n\n** ALL ABOUT DAISY **\nDaisy is said to be born June 2016 and supposedly a terrier/cavalier king charles.\n\nDaisy is fostered with dogs and cats.\n\nShe was surrendered to a foster home, April 2017, at their home business, then we arranged boarding as she needed to be vetted and groomed for the night.\n\nWhen I met her for the first time in April 2017 she was shy and scared for a few minutes then she was playful and affectionate but not hyper. \n\nDaisy warmed up to me within minutes of meeting me and even licked my hand.\n\nShe was given to last owner 4 months prior in December/January 2018.\n\nShe was then found by side of the road 8 weeks later. \nShe was seen by a vet and her eye was treated. \nShe now has a slight head tilt. \nThey feel she was hit by a vehicle.\n\nShe is cratetrained/housetrained, and was living with three other dogs, and used to kids, and didn't bother owners geese.\n\nOn intake she met chickens unexpectedly, and ran from them.\n\nShe has a sweet demeanor but the place she was boarded at after being given up by her owner said she was nervous at first as well. (Understandably)\nand she has shown to be very uncertain of children.\nFor that reason we are looking for a spot with no kids as we don't want her stressed.\n\nOnce arriving in to rescue and after her vetting April 2017 she started having seizures in our care.\n\nShe has been checked and is now treated with inexpensive medicatios that she gets daily with success. \n\nShe loves to be with other dogs and follows her foster mom around - if you are home more often than not and have a nicely mannered fellow dog it's possible that Daisy could be a great addition to your home.\n\nShe doesn't like walks and she doesn't like car rides - She is a home body.\n\nFoster adds (April 2020)\n\n\"Personality - She suffers from seizures due to traumatic\u00a0 brain injury. She has her own routine and she doesn't like change. When nervous she will pace. \nDaisy is not a lap dog. \nShe will come when she wants to be petted or for attention. \n\nShe doesn't bark. \n\nShe would not be good for apartment as she needs a secure fenced back yard.\n\nPeople/ Strangers & Kids: Daisy is shy around new people. She doesn't interact very much.\n\n\nInteraction with Packmates- dogs/ cats -She is fine with dogs and cats she doesn't bother cats and is fine with respectful dogs, She doesn't play very offen. She pretty much does her own thing.\n\nEnergy level-\u00a0 very low energy \n\nHouse : she is great in house. She will go to door to go out and pace in circles when she needs to go to bathroom .\u00a0 She will have an accident if you are not near by to let her out.\n\nCrating: she is crated when we are not home and is great in the crate. She gets treats in her crate when we go out.\n\nFood: she is free fed and no aggression to food.\u00a0 She eats grain free. \n\nToys: she once in awhile plays with toys but not overly interested. \n\nLikes: she loves going outside and laying in the sun in warm weather. \n\nDislikes: loud noises and other dogs barking. She doesn't like going for walks as traffic noise spooks her and strangers walking and kids.\n\nLeash respect & training/ Commands: she doesn't like collars and leashes.\u00a0 She will pace when she sees one and needs to be confined in a small area in order to place one on.\n\nYard rules: she needs a full fenced in yard must be secured. She can not be tied out and no under ground fencing.\n\nGrooming: she doesn't like to be brushed. Not a fan of baths.\n\nTraveling : she is fine in vehicle will just lay down and sleep. No car sickness.\n\nCurrent Routine : she gets up and let out of crate when I get home from work.\u00a0 She then will come in and lay down. She is given her meds for seizures. Then she will go on couch and sleep..she gets up and goes out to bathroom then comes in and lays down.\n\nDaisy needs a home she feels safe in a quiet home with another dog. \nShe needs someone that is home more than not. She would not be good at a trailer or cottage. \nShe sometimes gets up and is confused a bit. \nShe needs a home where she isn't forced to do things as she will stress and pace. \nShe needs someone familiar with seizures and giving medication on schedule. \nDaisy has suffered many seizures till we got meds regulated. \nShe will go months with out a seizure but may suffer several at a time once they start.\nShe is over all a very sweet girl that just needs the right family where she can be herself.\"\n\nHer adoption fee-  $500\n\nWE DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF ONTARIO\n*******************************************************\n\n*** HOW IT WORKS - ADOPTION INFORMATION **** \nPlease read ** ALL** the information provided below on the process to \nsave time and facilitate the process in a smooth manner.\n\nApplications \nhttp://www.adoptapet.lucknow.on.ca/applications.html--This is a MS Word copy of our application.\nIt can be completed, saved and emailed back to the rescue at \npetrescue@hurontel.on.ca . \n\n1.

He was neutered on 2/2/17, is crate trained, loves to play with the other dogs, good with children and adults, loves to be pet, barks at our cats, and does ok on a leash, but needs some more work.  He loves to play with some old toys laying around, like a fox stuffed toy that doesn't have the stuffing or squeaker anymore. He runs around carrying it in his mouth, and gets another dog to play with him.\n\nD.O.B.:     ?

Please consider giving this wonderful girl a forever home!  \n\n\nPrior to discussing our dogs we will need you to complete the Preliminary Adoption Application on our homepage at www.henryhumane.com. \u00a0This application does not commit you to an adoption. It is used to screen those interested to make sure the home is a good match for the animal. If your application is approved, one of our volunteers will contact you via phone or email.\nAs with all our other pets please have an excellent verifiable vet history if you wish to be considered to adopt. Adoption Fee:  $250.00  All of our dogs have been given age-appropriate vaccinations, are spayed/neutered, dewormed, had capstar and/or frontline applied, heartworm tested and treated if necessary, and microchipped with registration pre paid.",

She is incredibly smart; knowing many commands including sit, stay, drop it, leave it, take it, shake, turn, go, come, touch, kennel, fetch and several others. Her foster says that Gemini actually thinks things through and figures out what needs to be done without being told. Due to having been tortured and neglected by men in the past, she has every right to be slow to trust them. She is still learning to enjoy the company of other animals. Gemini weighs 50 lbs so any dog in the home would need to be at least her size in order for there to be a possibility that she would get along with them. Gemini loves to run and would be a great running partner. The perfect home for this bundle of love, entertainment, and personality would be with a single woman who is an experienced dog owner and has no other pets in the home. Gemini is a charming young lady who will be a devoted companion to her lucky adopter. Gemini is kennel trained, is never destructive when roaming freely in the home, and is completely housebroken. She will need a fenced yard so she can get her energy out until her little heart's content. We prefer that Gemini's adopter live in the Omaha area so that she can work with our trainer at our expense, if anything should ever arise. Gemini's ideal adopter would be a dog experienced female, willing to continue to work with her on her fear issues. In return for these things, Gemini would provide protection, loyalty, companionship and would be one of the smartest , most eager to please dogs you have ever met. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Gemini is $200, which is tax deductible an goes toward the high cost of vetting our rescue dogs. Gemini is healthy and fully vetted. All she needs is a Second Chance!",

            "description": "**NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE** ... We are so busy with rescuing and caring for animals and can't return everyone's inquiry. If you are interested in adopting this pet...You must fill out the adoption application at:\nhttp://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php  (cut and paste into your browser) \nPLEASE READ all the following info. We do not reply to inquiries asking if the dog is still available, if it is listed here, then it is still available.\n\n**Local.Adoption Only**  We got this girl from the Bartlett Animal Shelter...they had taken her out of a neglectful situation.  We think she was approx 4 yrs old at time of rescue...April 2017 is approx 90 lbs\n She is house trained and kennel trained.  She is in a foster home with other dogs all sizes and is fine with them but she does not want to play with them.  She is an alpha and can be bossy with other dogs and really would prefer to have an owner all to herself to give her all the attention.  She would probably prefer to have a home without other dogs but is fine with a home with other dogs as long as they don't expect her to play with them or cuddle with them.  She will correct them verbally if they get on her hips or rough house around her.  Zena does have severe arthritis in her hips and is on daily meds and supplements to help her and will need to be on them the rest of her life.  She needs someone who can be gentle, understanding and careful with her because her arthritis is painful.  She is very well behaved but does have a diva, all about me, wants attention all the time, personality....she is very calm and laid back.  She loves to nap on the couch.  We would prefer an owner with rottweiler or large dog experience.  She needs an owner that will keep her on meds to help manage her arthritis and be willing to give her the attention she wants so badly from an owner.  She wants to be someone's BFF.  She knows to \"sit\".  She loves to go for rides and always wants to leave with her foster mom for car rides.  She loves meeting new people.  A rottie lover would love this girl...she is a typical rottie diva.  She will sit in front of you and give you a paw if you don't give her attention quick enough.  Due to her advanced arthritis we will not place her in a home with young children.  Zena's favorite place to hang out is on the couch...so if you don't want a dog on the couch...this is not the dog for you.\n\nAdoption fee is $150 and includes ... spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, heartworm negative, and kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nThis does not obligate you in any way. If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care.\n",

            "description": "Copeland is a special case that is going to take a really special someone to be his happily ever after. At present, he is working on some behavioral modification in the hopes of rehabilitating him enough that he can be placed in a home successfully. However, please read his story below and feel free to email us at bark@pawtropolis.com if you\u2019d like more details on his situation and how you can help with his rehabilitation. Copeland will not be adopted into a home with children because he tends to bite when scared. Additionally, he is not a candidate for Apartment or Condominium living as he is quite vocal when left alone and would be very stressed if he had to interact regularly with people and dogs who were not in his immediate family.\u00a0\n\nCopeland was originally brought into Helping Paws Rescue in February 2017. He was an owner surrender to Barrow County Animal Control and not much is known about his past life before arriving. At the shelter, he was fearful and they reported that he was distrustful of men, so when we came to evaluate him, we were skeptical if he would be able to be handled. He showed fearful, tense, and what appeared to be submissive body language with us, but allowed us to handle him and pick him up without incident. Like so many dogs at the shelter, he was in fact completely shutdown, so we decided that we would give him a chance to flourish with us.\n\nSince then, he has bounced through several foster homes and has had increasingly aggressive reactions to both other dogs in the home and strangers. He lived full-time at our Westside facility for a few years where the staff worked diligently with him on learning trust and also on how to read his body language when he\u2019s uncomfortable so that he isn\u2019t put in situations that he feels the need to bite. He currently lives full time in a foster home where his foster mom is working with him. He is a current patient of the UGA Veterinary Teaching Hospital Behavior Medicine program where they have diagnosed him with a generalized anxiety disorder that manifests in fear aggression. Like people that suffer from the same disorder, he lacks the coping mechanisms to deal with situations he perceives as stressful and so he has learned that the only way he can control the situation is to bite. His behavioral modification exercises will hopefully build a foundation for him to learn those coping mechanisms. If successful in his rehabilitation, UGA has offered to continue consulting with his new family so that they can continue to receive professional feedback on his transition into a new home.\n\nWhen you get around Copeland\u2019s troubled emotions, you get to see a very sweet, intelligent, and downright silly personality. He loves to play with toys and will happily toss them to himself. He loves going for car rides and walks. He enjoys being with the people that he trusts, leaning against them and napping nearby. He also loves to learn new things. He has all his basic manners down cold including sit, down, wait, walking nicely on a leash, and potty training. He has been clicker trained as well, and he loves to work for his food and treats with that. We are committed to giving Copeland his best chance at happiness. We are limiting his visitors to only serious applicants who can provide him with safety and stability that he needs and would love to hear from someone that might be willing to work with him and bring them into their home.\n\nThanks for your interest in this pet. For more information about our adoption procedure please visit www.pawtropolis.com. We rarely do out of state adoptions.

Brindee now has a great passion for food and will let you hear about it if you are late with the food bowl! She really is a talker and loves to chat for attention when she sees anyone around. Like most dogs that lived in starvation, she can be protective of her food bowl. We would not recommend a home with young children. She can be dog friendly as long as they respect her space when she doesn\u2019t feel like playing. Brindee is fully vetted, heart worm negative and around 4 years old. Adoption information and application can be found on our website here. For more information, please contact Peace Love and Animals :)",

She has been spayed and fully vetted.\n Frankie and her brother, Flint,  were found as strays when they were only about 8 weeks old. These Chow/ Shepherd Mix are very sweet dogs but can be a bit timid. They walk great on a leash and you can walk them both easily together, they also enjoy swimming and boat rides and play very well together. It may take some time for them to warm up to you but once they do they will be very loving and loyal companions. We believe they will act very different once inside of their forever homes. With love and care, these two will be shining bright in no time. \nFrankie and her brother, Flint are extremely bonded and reliant on one another.  They will only be adopted out together, but there is a special adoption fee in place for anyone who meets all adoption requirements, and is willing to adopt the pair.\n\nVisit www.claytoncountyhumane.org  for pet information or call the Clayton County Humane Society for assistance 770-471-9436  Clayton County Humane Society  7810 N.

Flint has been neutered and fully vetted.\n Flint and his sister, Frankie, were found as strays when they were only about 8 weeks old. These Chow/ Shepherd Mix are very sweet dogs but can be a bit timid. They walk great on a leash and you can walk them both easily together, they also enjoy swimming and boat rides and play very well together. It may take some time for them to warm up to you but once they do they will be very loving and loyal companions. We believe they will act very different once inside of their forever homes. With love and care, these two will be shining bright in no time. \nFlint and his sister, Frankie, are a very bonded pair and very reliant on each other.  They will only be adopted out together.  However, there is a special adoption fee in place for anyone who meets all adoption qualifications, and is willing to adopt the pair.\n\n\nVisit www.claytoncountyhumane.org  for pet information or call the Clayton County Humane Society for assistance 770-471-9436  Clayton County Humane Society  7810 N.

Buddy needs an experienced dog person, he cn not be allowed off leash EVER, he needs someone willing to get him out ofhis shell. Posted 1/14/13 Buddy was in a very bad situation, born in a barn and not socialized or fed on a regualar basis. He is very shy and with a little work can become a wonderful companion,. He is about 10 months old and weighs 38lbs so he will be a meduim sized dog. He is slowly getting used to being in a house since it is all foreign to him. He is much more comfortable outside and PLAYS like a champ! This dog does need a fenced yard!! His adoption fee is $200, BUT remember he needs a little work to be your BEST BUDDY!! All the dogs are Spayed or Neutered, Heartworm/Lyme tested, UTD on vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas and overall Vet checked. We offer a 30 day money back guarantee along with an adoption kit . Application REQUIRED. We take the applications in the order that we receive them. Adoption fee required.

Hendrix is a 10 year old Pomeranian/Chihuahua mix that Milwaukee Pets Alive rescued from Milwaukee Animal Control (MADACC).  Red/tan in color, Hendrix resembles a little fox and is cute as a button.  Besides being adorable, all those that meet this happy little guy who is always \u201csmiling\u201d describe him as the sweetest, friendliest, most phenomenal little soul you will ever meet.\n\nWhen someone says \u201cHendrix\u201d, \u201cloyal\u201d and \u201caffectionate\u201d are what comes to mind.  Hendrix\u2019s first love in life is people.  Where the humans are is where Hendrix will be and as a lap dog, if you are sitting somewhere where he can access your lap, he will be on it.  His foster family and all that know Hendrix constantly comment on the fact that they have never known a dog that truly craves being held and snuggled all the time like Hendrix does - his joy in life is being with his people.  Hendrix is looking for the people that will be as devoted to him as he will be to them.  The people who will commit and love him forever, as a beloved member of the family, as a best friend, and as a companion.  As attention from humans is what he craves most in life, Hendrix is looking for a forever mom and/or dad with plenty of time to give to Hendrix for love, attention, affection, and exercise (Hendrix lives for walks!  Read below) and want to share time with this incredible little guy.  Everyone has to work, but if you are always gone and on the go outside of work, Hendrix would not be the companion for you.  Hendrix wants someone who wants to hang out with him!\n\nBesides loving people, Hendrix LOVES his walks!  Many people think little dogs only want to walk to the end of the block and back \u2013 not this little dog!  Hendrix looks forward to his walks SO much.  He gets so excited when he knows he\u2019s going out for a walk.  Sometimes he gets so excited that he runs in circles around the first floor of his foster home in anticipation.  He goes for walks every single day.  Hendrix adores taking in all the smells outdoors, nose to the ground, sniffing the trail of all those dogs that have walked the same path before him \u2013 a little bloodhound in a tiny dog\u2019s body!  Also, Hendrix is not a dog who shakes, shivers, and is afraid to step paw outside when the temperature drops below 50 degrees.  Hendrix loves to walk year round \u2013 warm and cold out (it must be the Pomeranian undercoat keeping him warm).  If you are drawn to little dogs because you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to walk them, Hendrix is not the companion for you.  He is looking for a forever family that wants to get out there and exercise with him on a structured walk every day in all 4 seasons (not running around a fenced in back yard - that's that mentally fulfilling to any dog - they want to go on a walk with their person).\n\nAnd Purebites freeze-dried chicken treats.  He's a wild-man for these!  Next to people, these are his second favorite thing in the world - so stock up!\n  \nHendrix\u2019s favorite toys include a couple of different Kongs that he likes to chase and chew (and bark at as he runs after them).  Ball toys/little tennis balls are fun to chase after as well, though he still has not fully grasped the concept of completing the process of fetch, which is charming in its own right.\n\nHendrix has a small dog that he lives with and that he naps with occasionally, but his first choice and preference is to cuddle with humans.  The presence of the other dog in the home seems to give Hendrix some anxiety and we can tell Hendrix would prefer to be the only animal in the home so he can have all the attention to himself - he loves people that much.  Hendrix does get along fine with other well-behaved dogs so if you encounter other canines while out on your walks, he'll be just fine - he would just prefer not to live with one.\n\nHaving guests over?  Hendrix will give them a warm welcome to your home and will take over a guest\u2019s lap and remain there for an hour or so if possible.  Hendrix is a \u201cpeople-dog\u201d if there ever was one.  He really demands to be the center of attention and when you meet Hendrix, you\u2019ll understand why he rightfully deserves to be.\n\nBesides making your guests feel welcome, he may just provide them with some entertainment as well!  Hendrix sometimes will bark or \u201cyip\u201d along to music when played in the foster home or when his people are singing along.  America\u2019s next \u201cCanine Idol\u201d in the making!\n\nWhen Hendrix is not snuggling a human at every opportunity, enjoying the scents of the outdoors on a walk, or playing with toys, Hendrix can be found lounging with his favorite blanket anywhere the sunlight comes in through the windows.\n\nChange is so hard on animals.  Hendrix loves his routine and is looking for a forever family with a stable home environment where his person or persons are established in their life and residence.\n\nHendrix does not like travel.  Hendrix has extreme car anxiety - even for short distances.  Hendrix needs a forever family that tends to stay close to home, and, if they do occasionally travel, has family, friends, etc. that can stay with him or they secure a pet sitter so he can stay in the comfort of his territory - his home.\n\nBecause of his small size and delicate frame and legs, we are looking for an adult-only home for Hendrix.  The ideal family for Hendrix is one with someone or someones who aren't going to have children or whose kids are grown and out of the home.  Hendrix craves attention and wants to be someone's baby (and not have to compete with their human \"babies\" for their attention).\n\nHendrix has a few insecurities and anxieties as all small dogs do, but you will feel confident helping him feel his most confident as you go to training together as we require of all of our new dog adopters.  Hendrix will bark upon his humans leaving the home though will quiet down soon after they leave.  He also will bark when excited (like when someone comes to the door!).  As such, he would be best in a house, not an apartment/condo.\n\nOn a routine wellness exam, Hendrix was found to have a heart murmur.  Milwaukee Pets Alive provides comprehensive care to every animal in our program and we looked into the matter further with a veterinary cardiologist and in October 2018 Hendrix was diagnosed with degenerative valve disease (or endocardiosis), a heart condition common in smaller breed dogs as they age.  The condition is always progressive, but how it progresses can vary from dog to dog and there is no way to know how it will progress.  Some dogs live a long life without ever developing any problems associated with endocardiosis.  Others will experience complications over time.  Research has shown that a medication called Vetmedin can delay complications so being an organization that provides our animals with anything and everything they need to live their best lives, we of course started the drug with Hendrix and he takes it easily twice a day.  At Hendrix's 1-year cardiology follow-up and repeat echocardiogram in October 2019, we were pleased to hear that Hendrix's heart condition had remained stable since he was diagnosed a year prior.  However at his most recent cardiology check up in December 2020, his disease did show progression, revealing left atrial enlargement and a ventricular arrhythmia.  We started Hendrix on an additional medication, benazepril, which decreases the resistance against which the heart has to pump.  He takes this med also twice a day and with ease.  \n\nWe expect a continuum of care to that which our organization provides and Hendrix's adoptive family will need to continue the comprehensive veterinary care he receives in our rescue (and have the financial means to do so) by monitoring his heart health with his veterinary cardiologist as part of his care (now every 6 months for an echocardiogram, ECG, and blood pressure) and provide whatever care necessary as directed by his cardiologist as his heart condition progresses including continuing his Vetmedin and benazapril medication regimen and any other medications, diagnostics, or treatments deemed necessary in the future.  \n\nHendrix is a happy, energetic dog who you wouldn't know has a heart condition by looking at him and is deserving of love regardless of the fact.  While Hendrix did not start out with a special need/consideration (and developed one since being with us), MPA serves a primarily special needs population of animals and we always like to point out, every human has an issue they are dealing with (no one is perfect), and we all want to receive love.  Our animal companions are no different, and are the most perfect beings on earth, special need/consideration or not.  To us, Hendrix (and his heart) is perfect - he loves everyone and there isn't a being, or heart, more perfect than that.  He will love someone(s) unconditionally and deserves the same along with a commitment to the care he needs. \n\nA devoted friend, Hendrix will always be by your side and is waiting for that special mom and/or dad to make the same commitment to him forever.\n\nCompanion animals are family.  They are not \u201cless than\u201d, \u201cbelow\u201d, \u201cbeneath,\u201d or any different from human family members.  They are one and the same to us and we seek those adopters who share the same philosophy and feel the same way about these, the most amazing beings we are so privileged to share our lives with.  If you live in the Milwaukee Metro Area, and if you have what Hendrix is looking for in his forever home and will promise to love him always (and know you\u2019re lucky to have the opportunity to do so), send us a message telling us about yourself and detailing what you can provide our family member, Hendrix! (inquiries that don't include this will not be considered).  Hendrix\u2019s adoption fee is $175 and, like all MPA adoptables, he is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Hendrix is waiting to cuddle with you!",

He loves receiving affection from people, as well as the occasional dog treat.\nCoco is full-grown and weighs 37 pounds.  We believe he may be a Kelpie mix. \nHe will make a great companion to a loving and caring family. Who wouldn\u2019t want to make Coco\u2019s life complete and be his devoted family?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

He has come quite a ways in his progress at HUA. He loves his good nutritious food that has helped him gain a tad more weight that he probably should have - but how could we say no to anything his sweet little heart desires? He likes running around with his dog friends at recess and cuddling in piles of soft blankets. These things may sound small, but they are things he was sadly deprived of for ten years. He is still a little bit shy but every day he is getting more and more brave. He is starting to approach his favorite caretakers for pats on the head, which is a major milestone for our dear Hyatt. We know he loves life at HUA, and he would not even believe his good fortune if he were to know life in a home for his final years...the life he always should have had, one nearly robbed entirely by the rotten puppy mill that imprisoned him for a decade.\n\nTo learn more about this dog and to complete an online adoption application, please visit our website at www.hua.org.",

            "description": "Oriole is a very special dog. She came to us from a puppy mill in Missouri that finally shut down due to lack of funds. For many years, HUA has taken dogs from this mill who either had no human interaction or violent human interaction. Oriole was practically feral when she arrived at the shelter. She was terrified beyond belief. We were not sure she would ever be able to forgive the human race for the monstrosities she had endured. To our shock and amazement, this beautiful girl has decided that she is going to make up for lost time. She lives freely in our hallways and laundry room and is allowed to come and go as she pleases. Because of this, Oriole has realized that we are not going to put boundaries on her happiness. She ADORES the other dogs and plays all day long. She is learning how totally fabulous soft beds and squeaky toys can be. She takes care of the new pups that come in quaking with fear and shows them the super hiding places on the shelves of freshly laundered blankets. Oriole is nosey and always wants to know what we are up to, but she still shies away from our touch. She dares us to play chase and try to catch her, but she does not yet want to snuggle. She may never be a cuddly, clingy dog, but she will always be worthy of our admiration and respect. Oriole will be a wonderful companion for another dog who may be feeling lonely or bored, as she knows the heartache of being alone. She is brave, she is stoic, she is a survivor, and we love her.\n\nTo learn more about this dog and to complete an online adoption application, please visit our website at www.hua.org.",

I ama favorite among staff, students and volunteers alike!I just need that one person who will take the time to get to know me for the lovely girl I am. I don't like to be alone for long periods of time, I love to stick close by my humans. I love playing ball!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes: \n\n I stickclose by my humans, and I don't like to be left alone for long periods.I would be a great companion for someone who works from home, or is retired.I am a strong girl but our students and volunteers have worked hard to teach me some manners. Now, I walklovely on leash! I sometimes bark at other dogs or humans when out walking, but I ameasily redirected with simple cues.\n\nDoes Scarlett like other pets?\n\nI'd do best in a home without other dogs and nocats.\n\nDoes Scarlett like children?\n\n While I have played nicely with appropriate children, I can become overly excited.Because I sometimesforgetwhat a big girl I am, a home with no children would be best for me.\n\nFavorite toys?\n\n I love to chase a ball (sometimes I'll even bring it back to you!)or chew on a squeaky toy. Kongs and other durable bones are great, too.\n\nIdeal Forever Home: \n\n I'm a total sweetheartwho wants to find someone who will love me as much as I love them. My perfect family will be patient with me as I adjust to life in a home. I'd do best in a house, not an apartmentand I'd love a fenced back yard to play in.I'd love someone who can be with me a lot and who will continue my training to help me be confident and well mannered as I learn to trust that they are mine forever.",

He's very sweet and well behaved. He likes to play and does well with the other dogs at his foster home.  Elton is crate trained and housebroken.  He is a large strong dog that will need to have a strong person to handle him.\nA home with a visible fence is required.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook! Click here!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n     \n  Additional info on our home page.\nTo learn more about our adoption process, please CLICK HERE \nHome FurEver is a non-profit foster based dog rescue seeking foster parents, volunteers and donations. Please see our website for more information.\n \nPlease note that Home FurEver does not post applications on line. We will receive all applications in person at local adoption events in order to conduct an in-person interview.  All members of the household should be present for the application and interview process. All applicants require a home inspection and vet check - Please note that we cannot drive more than an hour to do a home inspection.  We do require a fenced back yard for all bully breeds.  Some dogs may require households with children over a certain age.\n\nAsk yourself some questions before you consider bringing a new dog home.   1.  Am I ready for a LIFE LONG commitment?  2. Am I prepared for a rowdy puppy?  3. Am I prepared to potty train?   4. Is this the right breed for me or my family?  5. Can I afford the food and vet care for this dog?  6. Is it best to have a totally fenced yard?  7. Will I make a commitment to obedience training?",

She greets every morning with a perfect downward dog & a Namaste.\n\nWith all her Zen like personalities, she is an alpha so if you have other dogs in the house know that she likes to be the alpha and although she enjoys the dog park she might be better in a home with no other dog. \n\nShe does not like cats, so please no cats for this girl.  Again, for all those who didn't read it the 1st time...

            "description": "**NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE** ... We are so busy with rescuing and caring for animals and can't return everyone's inquiry. If you are interested in adopting this pet...You must fill out the adoption application at:\nhttp://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php (cut and paste into your browser)\nPLEASE READ all the following info. We do not reply to inquiries asking if the dog is still available, if it is listed here, then it is still available.\n\nThis sweet girl had us at hello.  Possum is a very sweet, very friendly, loves all other dogs cutie that was picked up as a stray.  Possum is deaf but that doesn't stop her from giving you her unconditional love and attention. She is so smart, eager to learn, and happy and smiling all the time. Possum is approx 8 months old as of March 2017 and weighs 40 lbs. Possum is currently looking for a foster home or forever home that will be patient and willing to work with her deafness.  When we rescued her we did not even realize she was deaf at first...she was so happy, affectionate and eager to please us we didn't notice at first.  Possum is kennel trained.  She loves toys and loves to play with other dogs.  She will be happiest with an owner that will give her the attention she needs and wants.  She is fine with a home with or without other dogs.  In a perfect world we would love to find someone who has experience with deaf dogs that can teach her sign language.  We can't be certain what her breed mixture is but we feel like australian shepherd is a good guess, but she could be a mix of many breeds.  This sweet girl needs you to make her life complete.\n\nAdoption fee is $150 and includes ... spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, heartworm negative, and kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nThis does not obligate you in any way. If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care.\n",

            "description": "**NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE** ... We are so busy with rescuing and caring for animals and can't return everyone's inquiry. If you are interested in adopting this pet...You must fill out the adoption application at:\nhttp://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php (cut and paste into your browser)\nPLEASE READ all the following info. We do not reply to inquiries asking if the dog is still available, if it is listed here, then it is still available.\n\nWe are not sure what breed mixture Snowball is...we feel like he is probably terrier...maybe even has some Jack Russel terrier in him considering his personality and behavior.  We met Snowball while out knocking on doors offering dog houses to dogs on chains and in need.  We always took Snowball straw and food and he was always tangled up on his short chain, but we never found anyone home when we would go by to check on him.  He was always so adorable and so happy to see us and it broke our hearts to see him on that chain.  Well...persistence and patience paid off...because we finally caught Snowball's owner at home and he surrendered Snowball to us...Snowball is a sweet boy who is approx 2 yrs old as of March 2017 and weighs 26 lbs. \n Snowball is such a happy little guy and is always smiling.  He needs someone to give him the attention he hasn't had and someone to be patient with him and show him how great life can be off a chain.  Based on how he behaved when we first brought him in, he appeared to have been in a house at some point in his past.  He is full of affection, but needs someone to show him all the manners he has missed out on someone teaching him.  He likes to sit next to you and follow you.  You should see him run all over the yard now that he is off a chain...he runs and chases bees and is smiling the whole time.  He is kennel trained.  He is good with the other dogs of all sizes in his foster home, but he does try to be the bossy one.  Sometimes he gets confused and isn't sure about coming back inside the house, as if he has been punished for getting near the door, so he needs someone that will be patient with him and work with this.  He doesn't always do this, but when he does, the foster mom has to go outside and sit at the patio table and wait for him to come over and then pick him up and take him inside.  This is easily corrected if someone will just be patient and reward him for coming inside.  Snowball is so crazy about toys and loves loves loves to have them and play with them and as of yet has never torn one up.  He had a horrible infection in his neck from the collar being so tight...but is fine now.   Little Snowball is off his chain and will never be on one again. Together we are making a difference.  Please consider fostering or adopting this sweet boy...so he can have the happy ever after he deserves.  \n\nAdoption fee is $150 and includes ... spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, heartworm negative, and kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nThis does not obligate you in any way. If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care.\n",

            "description": "She smiles when she is with you\n\nHER STORY\n\n Kaily gave birth to 8 puppies on November 17, 2015; 4 girls & 4 boys. All have been adopted.  Kaily appears to be a true Labrador Retriever but mixed with something. Kaily had no microchip and I guess she ran away for a better life.\n \n Kaily ate through her rope and tie-down from her home and ended up at one of my feeding stations very pregnant. She gave birth to 9 puppies almost 1 week later. Very smart girl, I guess Kaily decided she would not give birth while tied up. \n \n She had on a huge black collar and chain that she broke to escape her previous home. That awful collar has been removed for a more stylist one.\n \n As soon as she had her babies, I climbed the fence and found her 2 day old babies laying filth, dirt, trash, it was not very nice and they were covered already with fleas. This may have been Kaily's first litter, she tried to hide them from the elements but she didn't do a very good job, they were completely exposed to the wind and rain. 1 little puppy didn't make it. But the other 8 looked good. \n\n Kaily ended up being very happy to be rescued, loaded up and taken to a clean, safe home where she could receive love & attention. \n\n Kaily is 2.5 years old and currently weighs 68 lbs but she could stand to lose a few pounds. I\u2019m sure with regular walks she would probably lose 10 pounds easily. Kaily has a great personalities, she is very quiet, friendly and gets along with all humans and dogs. Actually her entire litter of puppies were all very quiet, quiet when they played, ate, wrestled, they were just a very calm, chill bunch. \n \n Kaily does not get upset, nor is she destructive. She will sleep in her crate but she is fine just sleeping on her doggy bed, she is not destructive. She will play with toys but she would rather have some ear scratches and love from her human and cuddle besides you. She is not a shadow dog, very independent but she keeps an eye on you to make sure you are still there. Her solemn look turns into a smile while she is following you around and she is just close to you, all she wants s to share her love. Kaily is a great, very calm, well behaved young lady and will make a great family pet.\n\n \n Kaily is a Labrador Retriever mix with a bronzy brown coat with black going doing the middle. Now that she knows she is safe and not chained up, she is the perfect little lady. She requires very little maintenance and just wants to be loved. She has 1 male playmate that she is fond of but she is in a home with a variety of foster brothers and sisters. She gets along with small and big dogs, her first roommate upon arriving here was a 4 pound Maltese and he made sure she knew who was boss!!\n \n Kaily has a mild demeanor; not aggressive in any area and likes to get out for walks but not demanding of them. Nor does her behavior require that she be walked on a daily basis.  Kaily's coat looks a lot better now than when she was first rescued.  Please consider giving Kaily her chance at a forever home.\n\n  PLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE PICTURES: roxysk9rescue.org   \n\n  ADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED   \n\n  Roxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our foster dogs are raised in private homes; .

He's working on his obedience training:  the video shows him holding his pretty \"sit\" and waiting for his treat.  He likes other dogs, but is still learning to control his puppy enthusiasm, so his adopter should plan to continue his socialization.  For the same reason, a household with older rather than younger children would be best for him.  He is crate trained and clean in his kennel, so he has a head start on housetraining.",

I was in a high kill shelter and scheduled to be euthanized. Shelter staff reached out to my rescue people and pleaded for my life. They couldn't say no. I had a cancerous mammary mass but had surgery to remove it. I am a super friendly, lovable little girl. I love children, going on hikes, and giving puppy kisses. I have been professionally trained, spayed, potty trained, microchipped, and current on shots. If you are looking for a sweet, loyal companion who will give you unconditional love, I am your girl",

She was adopted from the shelter but once she showed trust issues with people her owner decided not to walk her at all and she spent two years inside the home rarely going out and using wee wee pads. She became overweight and under socialized even more. Delilah was sent to one of our trainers and has done so well with her progress. She is good with dogs and cats now and is good with people with the right introduction. She loves long walks in the neighborhood and now is much slimmer and looking healthy. She rolls on her back for belly rubs, plays with the other dogs and just loves being outside now. We desperately need a foster or adopter for Delilah by March 25th otherwise she will have to go into boarding. Please contact us directly at hudsonrotties@gmail.com if you can foster or adopt Delilah. She is currently in Suffolk County, NY.",

While he may have been a little clueless when he got here, he\u2019s figured things out pretty \nquickly and become a really good boy. He loves to be with people and loves to know what\u2019s going. To satisfy his curiosity. he likes to jump really high on top of his kennel so \nhe can see everything around him. Louie is an Terrier Mix and is crate trained, He\u2019s looking for his human BFF and maybe a tall fence. He is dog selective and doesn\u2019t  get \nalong with every dog he meets but he does love playing with several of the hounds at the shelter. He would prefer to be the only dog or have just one friend to live with after \na good introduction.\n\n\nCall,  Text,  Sabrina at 703-505-3758 \nEmail is sdroescher@yahoo.com   \nThese are all good loving dogs who need a forever home, Help us Save them",

She is a little slow on walks and would just like to smell the flowers. \n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application. We do adopt out of state and will arrange transports. Our dogs are not allowed to fly cargo at any time.",

My sidekick and bestie is Gidgit she's \"mature\" too LOL  We are a pair and 2nd Chance said we have no worries we will not be separated and if that means we stay with our foster mommy & daddy furever they are OK with that :)\nWe have a fenced yard and fur buddies to play with so life is good!   \nWe've had some crazy times in our 16 years.  Our first 9 we lived with a hoarder.  Now I can tell you that was NOT fun!  We were kept in stacked cages and there wasn't much room and it was FILTHY and when someone pottied above us well you can guess what happened :(   Then the police came and got all of us and that was awesome!  They took us to the shelter and while other dogs seemed scared to be there we were pretty excited because we got nice soft, clean beds and yummy food and they gave us this warm thing called a bath and WOW we smelled really \"pretty\"!  Gidgit and I were adopted by an older couple and although they were nice they didn't fix are wobbly knees so we have some \"issues\" with them but we've learned to adjust and we are too old for surgery now.\nThe couple started having health problems and they brought us back to the shelter :(  Lucky for us the awesome Rescue lady at the shelter scooped us up and called 2nd Chance who didn't care how old we were and now we are living with pups and having a great time!  Tomorrow we are having a dental.  I'm not sure what that means but our foster mommy says our breath smells \"stinky poo\"  I don't think that is a good smell cause when she says it her face gets all weird and wrinkly!\nWell I'm going to get ready for bed since I have a big day tomorrow.  Wish us luck!",

            "description": "See more pictures of Brody on his Facebook album!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=forgottendogsrescue&set=a.3732881646730605\n\nWell, hello Bo! Bo (previously Brody) is back with the rescue through no fault of his own after being adopted in 2017. His family has gone through some changes since originally adopting him and have come to the difficult decision that a different home would be best for him. Everyone say \u201chi and welcome back\u201d to Bo! \n\nBo is about 4 years old (estimated born around September 2016) and weighs about 65 pounds. Bo is a happy, handsome, energetic and cuddly Pit Bull/Lab mix. He LOVES to play. Tug? You bet. Fetch? Yep. He also loves to give kisses and is an expert cuddler. If Bo had a list of his favorite things to do, we are not sure which of these would be at the top so his new family should be ready for tug, fetch, snuggles AND kisses. \n\nBo would likely do best as an only dog. He has some dog friends but, is fairly selective about them and, if there is another dog in the home the dogs would need a very slow introduction to one another. He has a couple dog friends that he loves but, hasn\u2019t lived in a home with another dog since adopted. \n\nBo has been working with a professional trainer for the last six months and knows basic cues such as sit, down, spin and stay. Unfortunately, Bo was allowed off leash and hit by a car in October of 2019, and from that experience developed leash reactivity to stuff outside the house including things with wheels. We can\u2019t really blame him for that! Through positive reinforcement training, he has learned how to stay calm and pay attention to his trainer when he is out and about. The progress he has made has been amazing and he will need continued work with positive training methods to maintain the work that has been done to help him regain his confidence. He is treat motivated and eager to learn! \n\nBo loves going for hikes and swimming and does just fine in the car. He also loves his yard and, given his reactivity outside the house, will need a home with a yard so he can get his zoomies out and play his favorite games. Did we mention tug and fetch? Yep, those. \n\nBo has some nervousness around visitors to his home and we are reintroducing him to crate training so he has someplace comfortable and safe to be if the energy in the home is making him nervous. All in all, Bo has a few quirks given his history that his adoptive family will need to understand and be willing to continue the work that has been helping him be the best boy. He is worth it and will pay his family back in love, snuggles and kisses. \n\nIf you are interested in adding Bo to your family, please visit our website and submit an application or email us at: forgottendogsrescue@gmail.com. His adoption fee is $350 and he is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. And, so handsome.",

He's quiet,  well behaved and non-destructive among his good qualities. \n\n His favorite thing is to go for WALKS,  but dog parks are unacceptable for this guy.  Sorry!  But he will be Mans  best friend and provide you with the kind of un-dying loyalty, dedication, and constant companionship most people are looking for in a dog if he is given the chance......\n\nHe is a mix of being dog tolerant but also dog reactive..... he did have a female companion in his \"previous\" life but very sadly he was in a shelter for a VERY long time and now he has lost some of his \"social\" skills\n\nWe are thinking the ideal home would be a ONE DOG ONLY  home  to be on the safe side and absolutely NO CATS!  We know this limits his options but we want to set him up for success, not set him up to fail!   \n\nWe believe there IS a RIGHT home for most every dog, but sometimes we have to wait patiently for it to come along...... in the mean time he is SAFE with us!\n\n",

Harley is incredibly smart and loves having a job and learning new skills. He completed 6 weeks of agility training and loved the high energy exercise. He looks forward to attending his weekly doggie playgroup sessions at a local dog training studio, having so much fun that he pretty much passes out for the night when he returns to the shelter. Harley is sweet and aectionate, adores car rides and meeting new people. He enjoys exploring the outdoors, especially fenced-in back yards so he can chase lizards and bugs. He would do best in an adult, dog savvy household with no other pets or perhaps a large submissive female dog!\nIn order for Harley to continue enjoying his doggie playgroup sessions after adoption, LEADSRQ, is sponsoring Harley with a $300 training package at K9 Korral. Thank you LEADSRQ!\nFor an appointment to meet Harley, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070",

Anytime you walk outside she comes running up to you. She does have a habit of jumping up on you when she first is seeing you. She gets along well with other dogs her size. She walks well on a leash. Dixie loves to play fetch and she still chews on a lot of things so she likes to have toys to keep her occupied. She knows how to sit, shake, and lay down. Dixie loves any attention that she can get and loves meeting new people. She was a rescue dog who had previously ran away and has had puppies in the past but in now spayed.\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

He is not aggressive when it comes to food and will eat at his own pace. He can sit, lay down, drop, and stay. He sleeps in his bed on the floor next to me. He is very friendly and has never had any incident in which he bit another person or dog. He has been around small children and is very friendly with them.\n\n For more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\n  If you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page  at www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals  for more photos and details.",

Ironically enough, Sensei actually needs a sensei or in another words...a teacher. We aren't sure he has a lick of training but we know an experienced and calm owner could do wonders with him. He has mellowed a lot in the last few weeks, a far cry from the emaciated wild child that showed up from the animal shelter. Honestly, he was tough to handle and all over the place at first but he has settled in and become a willing student. We aren't sure if he has any doggie social skills yet but we do know he has some reactivity on leash (common in our breed) so he will need a little work in order to go for walks in the neighborhood. He won't be the right addition for a lot of people but for the right home, Sensei could be an amazing companion. Affectionate, smart and perfect for people who love to be active...absolutely full of potential.",

Fortunately, he's apparently very dog-social, as he let himself out of a crate and a fenced area in order to run with other dogs having that privilege. He is currently bunking with another male Dobie, who seems slightly overwhelmed by Marty's energy level. He did come directly to us when called, so he would likely be a good candidate for dog parks and dog beaches, and this would help to expend some of his energy. An adult home or at least one with teenage kids would be best, at least until Marty has enough training not to overwhelm smaller fry. He appears to know basic commands like \"sit\" and \"come.\" His animal shelter aged him at 5 years, but to our experienced eye he appears to be more like 3. When impounded at his shelter he had several wounds, one of which required shaving and suturing, on his forehead. We don't expect this to be permanently scarred, though it may always be noticeable.",

If you are interested in adopting Frankie, please send an email to PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application. \n\nAll of our animals are up to date on their vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, and have had a physical exam. At adoption we provide; veterinary records and vaccine certificates, castration certificate, lifetime lost animal support, leash, collar, ID tag, and a familiar toy or blanket to help them settle in. We also keep in contact and try to help with any issues that may need to be additional support.\n\nAdoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Home Check \nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nThis dog is located near Fresno, Ca\n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

When we first met Wally he found himself surrendered to a local animal shelter at a very young age. No one understood him for who he truly is a lively adventure dog. You can say that with people he lacked the correct manners but with his four-legged friends he was the prime example of a fantastic canine.\n\nWally quickly picked up the training we started with him and is always up for learning new things. As much as he depends on us to take care of him, we actually rely on him to assist us when teaching our other dogs how to correctly interact with their fellow dogs. Wally has had a lot of work building trust in people since a long time ago he was badly treated by the humans that were suppose to care for him. He now is a rising star here and we can\u2019t wait to see him in his new home!\n\nIf you are in need of an adventure dog or know of someone that is please fill out an application or share Wally with them today!\n\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7",

The application does not commit you to adopting, just helps us find the dog that is the right fit for your family. We do not have open adoption hours due to COVID-19 so an application must be submitted and approved before we set up an appointment for you to meet any of our dogs! It can take up to a week for the Adoption Board to review applications and upon approval will contact you.\n\nOur adoption fees are $250 ($125 for seniors over 8) and include their spay/neuter, bordetella vaccine, parvo/distemper & rabies shot, as well as heart worm testing and micro chipping.",

Chatham and Chatham Kent adoption applications only will be considered\n\nMilo is a very active 6 yr old maltese mix (DOB approx. 2014) who loves to be outside exploring.  He has keen sense of hearing because he will bark at new sounds and is very curious to see what\u2019s going on.  While he gets along with most dogs, he would be happiest to be the only apple of someone\u2019s eye.  He loves attention.\n\nHe was originally surrendered because his former owner did not have the time to take care of him and wanted him to have a better life.  He was left alone all day and crated at night, that\u2019s not the life for any adorable little guy like Milo.  He is a snuggler at bedtime.  Milo loves his toys, stuffed, squeaky or balls\u2026..he is ready to play!  \n\nMilo is looking for an active adopter to be his walking companion to explore new scents on his walks.  He is great in a car, he is good little passenger.\n\nHe gets very excited at mealtime and will let you know he\u2019s hungry!\nWe are looking for an adopter who has a  very secure fenced yard, works from home (not just during covid), or semi retired and is very active and wants a four legged companion to enjoy daily walks, car rides or just hanging out together.\n\nAdoption fee: $400\n\n",

His new family recently abandoned him at our local animal shelter. Linus has been moved around from home to home and we are looking to find him his final home. He is a Black Mouth Cur/ Labrador Mix with an estimated birth date of 10/16/16. Sadly, Linus's body shows a story that most won\u2019t want to hear. We hope to find him a forever home where he will be loved. He is GREAT around everyone and does not mind cats. He would LOVE to have a yard where he can spend his time running and playing during the day. He prefers to be outside when the weather is nice. He would do best in a home that is willing to work on basic training with him. Linus has been neutered, micro-chipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Linus please fill out an adoption application at www.spcaeasttx.com under the \"adopt a dog\" tab!",

Once he is picked up we will remove his profile. Please do not write to us for an application. Sorry for any inconvenience.\n\n\nMeet Ringo, a 2- 3 year old, 7-pound bundle of love. He is as sweet as he looks.  He gets along well with the other dogs in his foster home but would love to be an only dog. He is house-trained, uses the doggie door and sleeps in his crate. He sleeps great all night and eats everything you give him, no fussy eater here. He is just a great dog that could be placed in a home with kids or other dogs.  \n\nHe loves to be with his people and hang out with you whenever he can. He is a little shy at first and may need some time to adjust but once he is comfortable and lets his hair down he is super confident.  Ringo has a mild activity level and loves to play and chase the other dogs in his foster home.  \n\nHe does need some help with basic commands but he is a smart little guy and should pick up the basics quickly. He aims to please. This cuddly boy would be a great addition to a family or individual looking for an affectionate little dog to join their family. Ringo wouldn\u2019t do well left alone for a full work day and would like to have a canine companion if his parents are gone that long. He would do fine with no other dog as long as someone was around doing the day.\n\nRingo\u2019s adoption fee is $275.00 and he is being fostered in Vallejo, CA\n\nAll our dogs are in private foster homes and arrangements to meet our dogs occur after an application has been received.\n\nIf you would like to know more about this sweet boy or receive an application to adopt, please contact us at Dogzonerescue@yahoo.com",

I was rescued from the Bandera County Pound, along with my brother and sister. I love to play with toys and other dogs. I even love my foster mom's two cats. It takes me a little while to warm up to new people. It's tough when you get dumped on the streets at six weeks of age. The nice people who brought me to the pound found us in a box on the side of the road. I am sure glad they stopped and picked us up or we would have died. Will you take me home and keep me forever? Adoption fee $150 includes spay/neuter, current shots, and confirmation that the dog is heartworm negative. A Doggie 4 You is a non-profit organization. We are one of the only rescues that accept dogs that are injured or in need of medical treatment. Our standard adoption fee is $150, or $300 for a purebred or highly adoptable dog. All monies go towards the care and placement of the dogs. We use the higher adoption fees on the highly adoptable dogs to help offset the medical and surgical costs on the less desirable dogs. To donate, please go to: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RHPQWH7DV2S9W If you are interested in becoming a foster, please email us at adoggie4you@yahoo.com",

She got a new male companion and Charlie didn\u2019t like him. She felt she had no choice but to return Charlie. Charlie is wary of men. He is naturally drawn to women and his best home would be a quiet one so this would be without children or older children. One with a fenced yard and he can be an only dog or with other dogs. He does love other low energy dogs. He needs a family that has a soft touch in his handling. He responds to kind, soft words and gentle touches. He is fully potty trained, good on a leash and ready for his next best adventure. He is intelligent, very loyal and due to his breed, a natural protective boy. He is an adorable guy and will make some lucky family a great companion. He is up on his shots, neutered and ready for his forever home. His adoption fee is $185 and transport is $185.

All these dogs pictured here have been placed and this ad is just for attention only so folks click the currently adoptable dog's photo and read first before emailing or messaging though this site.  I am sorry but we do not adopt photos so reading first helps.  \n\nPlease don't fill in adoption any forms anywhere else, but on OUR website.  Thanks for that.  We do not adopt from Petfinder messaging so going to our main website helps the adoption process gets started.\n\nTo start our adoption process, please fill out our form on our web site at: www.spokanewienerdogs.org and see the Adopt a Dog/Fee page with more details on how we adopt our dogs. There are a lot of questions answered on our web site and personality details below about each dog BELOW so please READ BEFORE getting in touch. We already answer 500+ emails a day.  We do answer questions on dogs once our adoption paperwork is filled in so we can match to the right homes.    \n\nPlease indicate which dog you are interested in on our adoption form once you read the dog's bios here:  www.drnw.petfinder.com.  If their name says pending home then they are not available and are on a test drive with a new family.  We do remove our dogs when our adoptions are final so please do not ask us if dogs are available if you see their ads.\n\nWe have our adoptable dogs on this site as well as www.spokanewienerdogs.org as well as our requirements and our adoption form to fill in to start our adoption process.  Thanks for reading first BEFORE emailing us.  We do have time to speak to folks AFTER they have started our adoption process by visiting our To Adopt page first.\n\nFolks can visit the dogs AFTER our adoption form is filled in if they are adopting one from us.

In my book, \"crazy\" was a term of endearment and I loved it.  I will admit that I have aged a bit and have left some of my \"crazy\" ways behind me.  But I'm still very energetic!\n\nI'm hoping to find a wonderful family who don't have any other pets - I want to be the center of your universe!  I'd suggest that I don't have any young children as companions until I learn a few more manners.\n\nI am a very confident dog and I know better than my humans.  I will make sure that I keep you safe on walks.  A life in the city or a neighborhood with houses close together is not the best environment for me, especially if there are lots of dog walkers in the neighborhood.  I'd love a big yard with lots of room to run and play with my people.\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org. There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone! \n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/\n\nPlease note that we are a small regional rescue organization. We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

He is cautious around new people, but with a trusted person he flourishes! Also, once he gets to know you, he is sweet and lovable. He is such a happy boy - ready to give as many kisses and cuddles as you can handle! He's curious and loves to explore, bringing you all sorts of toys to play with him. He even watches TV!\n\nHe is very smart and could learn new tricks quickly and easily. Kibbles has a best friend that we would like him to be adopted with. His girlfriend's name is Cha Cha and she is a very sweet, loving German Pinscher (please see her bio). This couple absolutely loves each other, they love playing together or just hanging out with each other. They have not left each others' side since they met!!\n\nKibbles and Cha Cha are looking for a forever home or foster. Please contact us if you are interested in giving this couple and give both of them their second chance!\n\nDue to COVID, we have suspended adoption events however, we do do meet-and-greets.\n\nWe are located in LOS ANGELES, CA,  we DO NOT adopt outside of the Southern California area (as we require physical homechecks), nor will we ship dogs to other parts of the country, please do not ask.\n\n NOW on Instagram! @tailsofthecityrescue",

Very outgoing & friendly, she is very high energy. She needs an active owner and/or family. She knows how to sit & shake. She loves to ride in the car, loads right up. \n\nShe would probably be good with older kids, but not small ones. She is good with other dogs as long as they are easygoing & laidback. No cats, her prey drive is too strong.\n\nFaith will also need a secure 6ft stockade fence. \n\nFaith is house and crate trained, but will need assistance with leash training. We recommend an Easy Walker type of leash due to her strength. \n\nFor more information email her foster mom Sherrie: sherrie53@cox.net\n",
