All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Fill out an Adoption Application\nMia is a 6 year old female Dogo Argentino mix. She also comes from a rural shelter in North Carolina where she was not doing well. After being transferred to rescue in Norfolk , Va she spent 4 years there where her name was changed to Elsa because she was completely frozen with fear.We have given her much to be happy about and along with that her new name, Mia.She would not walk on a leash or play with other dogs and rarely let you pet her without cowering. She has transformed into a well adjusted, happy girl! Mia loves to walk on a leash and although she sometimes puts the brakes on...a stable pack leader with just a bit of pressure can move her right through. She also loves to be outside and loves the company of other dogs. You will find her curled up in a bed of leaves relaxing in the sun on a warm afternoon.Mia is still shy and will still cower if approached too quickly, she is also hard of hearing which may contribute to her insecureness but overall she has made huge progress and now deserves a home to call all hers.Again, Mia will need a leader to continue to overcome her quirks but she is an amazing girl.She is crate trained and potty trained. She rides great in the car. She will struggle with nails so that will take some patience and an extra hand. Mia is also up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed.Located in Knoxville, MD\nOur rescue policy requires the following:\n\nAdopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina and and parts of New York.\nWe will not adopt a giant breed dog to homes where the dog will have access to highly varnished hardwood steps inside the home. Any inside steps to which the dog(s) have access, must have carpeting, securely fixed stair treads, or a non-skid surface. We encourage you to remediate potential safety issues while your application is under review, prior to the home visit.\nMethods or devices using pain or force on the dog to control the dog, or to deter undesirable behavior is prohibited.\nApplications for giant breed dogs must be submitted by the property owner.\nHomes with children under 6 years of age will not be approved for adoption.\nHomes with children should have a fenced yard.\nPets currently in the applicant's home must have a history of appropriate veterinary care. Veterinary records will be checked.\nAll references must be checked before any visitation of the dog is permitted at the foster home.\nAll family members must be present during the home visit to the applicant's home.\nAny dog(s) in the applicant's home must have an introductory meeting with the rescue dog being considered, before any adoption can be completed.\nHomes with intact dogs will not be approved for adoption. Exceptions to this policy can be found on the Adoptable Dog Page.\n\nFor additional information please review our FAQs or contact: mastiffstomutts@gmail.com",

Even though she's technically a senior, she's still quite active and enjoys long walks or hikes. She believes age is just a number, and you shouldn't let it define you. Akita can be a bit wary of new people, so she does need to take some time to meet new friends. After a few walks with some tasty treats, she'll be happy to welcome you into her friend group though! Although Akita does live as a single dog at the Sanctuary, she has the potential to make new dog friends. She's just picky about her playmates. And cats are a definite no for this girl. Do you have room in your heart for a sweet, senior girl like Akita?\n\nIf you think Akita would be a good fit for you or your family, or if you would like to learn more, click \"Adopt Akita\" above to complete our survey and be connected with an Adoption Specialist.",

One-two years old and about 45 lbs.\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Tracy is energetic, outgoing and playful, and is fine with children and other dogs. She was picked up as a stray, but we know she was in a home, so she's probably house trained. She is very good on a leash, and would be a great walking companion. She is very loving and sweet, and really appreciates affection. Her right ear was split somehow but it is now repaired, and she's spayed and fully vetted. She is totally healthy and ready for her new home. Please email Dee at k9rescueva@gmail.com to schedule a meeting with this sweet girl.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

He is a super sweet boy, about 60 lbs, walks well on a leash, great with cats and is good with female dogs but NOT male dogs and can be a bit dominant where food is concerned. Very laid back in attitude.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Loves to give kisses. One-two years old and about 45 lbs.\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Since coming to us, she has learned to walk on a leash always with another dog, she enjoys the company and play with our pack and has lost several pounds through activity and exercise.She is full of energy and is quite food motivated and therefore eager to learn.Betsy does do better with larger male dogs or young nonchallenging females. She is not recommended to be around cats.She does great riding in the car, and dosent mind a nail trim. She is behaved at the vet, is crate trained and potty trained.Betsy is up to date on shots, spayed and microchipped. She was treated for heartworm and is now free and clear and is maintained on a monthly preventative.Located in Knoxville, MD\nOur rescue policy requires the following:\n\nAdopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina and and parts of New York.\nWe will not adopt a giant breed dog to homes where the dog will have access to highly varnished hardwood steps inside the home. Any inside steps to which the dog(s) have access, must have carpeting, securely fixed stair treads, or a non-skid surface. We encourage you to remediate potential safety issues while your application is under review, prior to the home visit.\nMethods or devices using pain or force on the dog to control the dog, or to deter undesirable behavior is prohibited.\nApplications for giant breed dogs must be submitted by the property owner.\nHomes with children under 6 years of age will not be approved for adoption.\nHomes with children should have a fenced yard.\nPets currently in the applicant's home must have a history of appropriate veterinary care.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Fill out an Adoption Application\nBugg is a 2 1/2 year old American Bulldog mix. Originally from North Carolina and transferred to Norfolk, Va as he was not doing well in the shelter. Unfortunately he stayed somewhat shutdown in rescue and we were asked to take him to do some training and integrate him into our pack to provide stability.Bugg has since done phenomenal. He enjoys leash walking always with another dog, he knows basic commands, he is mannerly and attentive. Bugg loves to run around outside with the pack and be a normal dog. He is still somewhat insecure and anyone interested must be willing to be patient with him. Once he trusts you, you have his loyalty completely and he will be your best friend. Bugg also does better with dogs who will not challenge him or exert dominance over him.He has made great progress and now just needs to continue with a loving furever home.Bugg is up to date on shots, neutered and microchipped. He does fantastic on car rides and loves to be groomed and once he trusts you even likes a good toe nail trim.Located in Knoxville, MD\nOur rescue policy requires the following:\n\nAdopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina and and parts of New York.\nWe will not adopt a giant breed dog to homes where the dog will have access to highly varnished hardwood steps inside the home.

I\u2019ve been at Paws 4 A Cause for about a 18 months.  I was in training to be a service dog, but because I can get a bit protective of my owner, I guess I didn\u2019t quite complete the program.  \nI love to gently play and get along with most other dogs at my rescue as long as we are introduced nicely.  I am a good snuggler and comforter, and I get really attached to my human.  I\u2019m a bit afraid of strangers, especially when they come into my home, so my foster mom just asks me to kennel up and I just hang out there until they leave.  \nI walk really well on a leash.  I\u2019m also chipped so I never get lost again.  I\u2019ve been neutered (ouch!!), and had all of my shots.  My ideal family would be a person that lives alone and just wants to hike, walk and snuggle.  My foster family would give you my kennel so they know I\u2019ll be safe and not afraid of strangers in your home.\nWill you be my forever human?\n",

When I meet new people I am very shy and may seem standoffish, but if you give me a few minutes I will be your best friend. I would be the perfect companion for someone who just wants a calm, sweet shadow. Please give me a chance at being your new best friend!",

Pearl is definitely more vocal (nice way of saying yappy) and Opal is much more quiet. They do take a good long nap during the day and a short nap around 7:00pm. They love belly rubs but they aren\u2019t pocket/purse or lap dogs. They like their fuzzy cozy bed and their stuffed toys.  Opal will find any little thing on the floor (or steal off the coffee table) and run and hide with her treasure while Pearl is the stinker that will chew electrical cords (or earbuds ?) if she gets the chance! They are both very active and get around really well in spite of their leg issues.  Per the orthopedic assessment, Pearl will need surgery to repair her leg (luxating patella) but not sure Opal would benefit enough from the surgery to warrant putting her through such drastic procedure.  These girls are very bonded and love each other very much. We are looking for a wonderful, amazing, loving home together since they are very bonded. We also are looking for a home that can be able to afford the surgery that Pearl will need in about 6 more months. They are spayed, fully vaccinated, tested negative for heartworm and Tick Born diseases, dewormed, microchipped, on Bravecto and Heart worm preventative.  Opal and Pearl are available for adoption now. Although good with kids, we are looking to place these girls in an adult only home due to their size. \n\nA home check is required. Yolo County adopters preferred, but will consider other locations. If you are more than 100 miles away from Yolo County please be aware that there may be a small additional expense associated with travel cost. \n\nIf you are interested in adoption Opal and Pearl, email us and we will send you an adoption application. (include your location in the email) The adoption fee for each puppy $650. \n\n*Vetting includes: Neuter/spay, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, heartworm test, flea preventative, heart worm preventative (including the remainder of their 6-month supply), and any other necessary vet care.",

            "description": "I'm chilling in a foster home currently. To inquire about me or to arrange a meeting, please email fosterdogadopt@orphansofthestorm.org\n\nMy name is Nina and I am five years old. I have lived with a foster family and they have found that I enjoy spending time outside. I have been kayaking, camping, and doing a ton of hiking in various places. I even like spending time outside with my foster parents while they tend to their yard. Here are a couple of notes you may want to know about me:\nSeparation anxiety - Yes, I do have it. I do not like to be alone. Overcoming separation anxiety is a work in progress. My current foster parents work from home so I enjoy the company of my foster parents most of the day, which means I get to walk them often. However, they have left me home alone between 3-6 hours on four separate occasions and I have not damaged anything! Nothing! Nada! Before my foster parents leave me home alone they walk me, feed me, and I have access to toys to keep me entertained. And when they return, I walk them again as a reward for my good behavior.\nCrate trained - No, I am not crate trained and I do not appear to like them. My foster parents report that I fear enclosed spaces - this includes bathrooms, mudrooms, and crates - so the crate is really not my thing. Did I mention that I have not destroyed anything in their home? I have not even played with the multiple plants they have on the floor inside their home nor with their window dressings. \nDog reactive - Yes, I do react to some dogs when I am out on walks. I also like to chase squirrels and other critters. At the shelter, I have had no problems playing with other dogs. My foster parents also reported that I do well while on walks at campgrounds where dogs abound. For the most part, I walk well on a leash. My foster parents have found that I like to run on a leash - which may distract me from chasing squirrels and reacting to other dogs.\nDashing out the door - I have yet to work on this, but my foster parents are pretty diligent in checking where I am before opening the door. Yes, I did leave the house one time, but that was because my foster mom left the backdoor ajar and I snuck out. Wouldn't you? I took them on an unsolicited brisk walk, but they caught up to me soon after and returned me home.\nHealth - I am healthy. I am taking some meds for joints and I am on prescription diet for allergies. \nBeggar - No, I do not beg for food. I leave you alone when you eat and respect your space. Isn't' that nice of me? \nBarky - No, I do not have this trait either. I don't bark just for the sake of barking. You know how some dogs bark, and bark, and bark, and bark? Not me. No, I don't do that. \nClingy - No, I do not have this trait. I do like being in the same room as my foster parents, but I do not cling to them. Nor do I jump on people when I meet them for the first time or when my foster parents return home.\nRubs and getting groomed - I absolutely love people doing these two things to me! I will roll on my back or melt in your arms if you brush my luxurious white coat. \nHouse broken - Of course I am house broken! I have not had any accidents during my stay with my foster parents. I have the outmost respect for their stuff.\nCome check me out! I will not disappoint.",

They saw her for a number of days then she disappeared.  Weeks later they saw her again coming out from underneath an abandoned house.  It wasn't long before they began to see 10 puppies joining her.  I was one of those puppies.\n\nMy mother would come and go, and then one day she never returned.  :(\n\nThe kind couple began collecting us puppies and moving us to their backyard, offering  us food and safety.  They worked diligently to find us families and were successful with 4 of us, until that changed.. The kind gentleman suffered a heart attack and his sweet bride fell off a ladder breaking her collar bone.  The rest of us puppies were still well cared for, but all other activities regarding the puppies had stopped.\n\nWhat would happen to us now???  Well Lucies Project was contacted, and they are taking us in a few at a time as space becomes available.  There are 3 of us here now, so that leaves 3 more of our siblings still to come.\n\nWe don't know why our mom left us, only other than to assume she could see that we would be well taken care of.  We miss her, but am glad she at least got us to safety.\n\nDo you think maybe you might want one of us?  We are truly adorable and would love nothing more than to play or cuddle with you.  We really want a family of our own.  Come see us and we will steal your heart!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

Although he is so sweet, Spike is also very energetic and he jumps on pretty much all sizes of people and with him being such a large dog we do not recommend he go to a home with small children. Spike would benefit greatly being in a home with someone who has plenty of time to exercise him regularly and work with him on basic obedience training. He would make a GREAT running, walking, or workout partner! Spike loves other dogs and would do great with another large dog that he can play with to burn off some of his energy.  We are not sure how Spike does with cats or other pets in the home, because he has never really been around them in the time he has been with us. Spike also needs someone who can help him work on his potty training. He does well if kept on a regular schedule but he will have accidents indoors if not given enough potty breaks. Spike is current on his vaccinations and he is now ready to find his new forever family. If you are interested in a sweet and fun new running partner then Spike is your guy! Come by the shelter and meet Spike today, or call us for more information.",

Please submit an application if you would like to welcome me into your home and are willing to be patient with me learning new things.\n\nOriginal\nHi, my name is Amelia. I recently came into VIP Rescue and will be looking for my new home soon!  I\u2019ve got a whole lot to learn about being a dog. I have 3 dogs, at my foster home, helping me with for my behavior and I progress every single day since I got here!!  I am very smart and although I\u2019m kinda cautious, I truly do enjoy learning new things and am getting more comfortable every passing day with all these new experiences.  I am potty trained, I am learning the leash thing.  I need my new home to offer lots of love and patience,  I need a confident dog to be my forever friend and sibling.  I need  home with a fenced yard. I\u2019m not picky about age or size, if they had a playful personality that will help me.  I just need another dog around for comfort and security, I really want to learn from them and I like to try to play. \n\nI am eagerly looking for my perfect forever person or family to call my very own!  A quiet adult home would be best.  A meet and greet will be required. \n\nAmelia is thought to be approximately 3 years old and weighs 28 lbs. I am most likely a terrier mix.  I am spayed, current on my shots, microchipped, and on flea and heartworm prevention.  I am heart worm positive. This means I have to take things easy for a while. I also must go see my doctor to get treatments so you have to be available to take me to Palm Harbor. My new family must be in Pinellas, West Pasco or NW Hillsborough.  We are accepting applications from experienced pet parents who already have a confident, friendly dog in the home and a fenced yard. Please submit your application to VIPRescue.org. And please share this post to help Amelia find her forever home. \n\nif you would like to know more about this dog, please complete an adoption application so that our volunteers  may contact you.    To do so, go to our web site:  http://viprescue.org/jobs/apply/?j=772\n\nAll of our available dogs for adoption are are on our website at:  \nhttp://viprescue.org/available-for-adoption/\n\nCheck us out on FACEBOOK and learn more about our adoptions and current events:   \n https://www.facebook.com/VIPRESCUEFLORIDA/\n\nTHANK YOU for thinking Rescue,\nVIP RESCUE OF FLORIDA\n\n",

I love car rides?, get along great with other dogs?, and enjoy sitting on the couch next to you while you watch TV.  ? \nI\u2019m still young at heart at 11 years old and would very quickly win a place in yours! My foster folks still have a hard believing I\u2019m 11.  I\u2019m a quiet, easygoing gal? who just happens to have kidney disease.  What that means is a special diet but simple to manage.  I will need a family that will love me even though I have inside accidents due to my disease. (My foster mom says it\u2019s no big deal just a few extra paper towels and cleaner?.) If you would like to learn more about me please fill out an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org that is a must to adopt from this rescue ! I would love to find my furever home in time for the Holidays! \n\nLove, Mercy xo",

            "description": "My name is Hank. Aren't I just so handsome?? I am a 1-2 year old Great Pyrenees. I was found wandering some dirt roads in rural Arkansas. I had been wandering for awhile and looked everywhere for my owner. Some nice people at Five Rivers Animal Aid, found me and looked for my owner, but none was found. The people that rescued me got rid of all my ticks and worms. My blood work is good now and I am gaining weight. \n\nI'm a friendly and active guy. I need a family that likes to walk and hike. I am social and would prefer to be with my family and not be left alone. If you can't keep your eye on me, chew toys help to keep me busy. And remember to keep the kitchen counter clean of food or I am liable to eat whatever is left for me there! Other dogs are fun to play with and I'm gentle with children. I am eager to please and most of the time I come when called especially if I know I'm going to get pets. I am house trained, walk well on a leash, and do fine in the car. I will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in the home must be at least 10 years of age. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

She is approximatley 3-1/2 years old and weighs in a little over 50 pounds. \n\nShe should NEVER be left outside unsupervised and should always wear a martingale collar when walking on a leash. Her shy nature leads her to want to run and hide, but she is gaining confidence each day. Her adoption fee is sponsored by our board members and will also go home with a Conair goodie bag!

I have a quite a tail to tell I was originally caught in a trap as I had been wondering around for months and neighbors were concerned for me. Then I was adopted out by another rescue but I was very bonded to my owners and would not accepting on anyone new in the home. My new owners turned me into the shelter to find a new home, they were sad and so was I. My current foster could not handle me when I first arrived as I was very fearful but now after love and patience I am a complete lovebug and I love to shower you with licks and to snuggle in your lap. I need an experienced dog owner who will be able to work with me on accepting new people and fenced yard in an adult only loving home. I am good with other dogs and working on my house manners. For the right home, I will be a treasure. If you would like to be considered to adopt me, please put in an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org \nShyly but with love, \nLizzie xo",

If you know anything about my breed, you know that my smeller is always set on overtime!\n\nI was found running in the highway by a kind disabled woman.  She asked her neighbors about me and found my owner.  Great right??  Wrong...2 days later there I was again in highway dodging vehicles.  We aren't too well known for our common sense.  Our smellers just seem to get the best of us!  Anyway, the same kind lady repeated the process of returning me a couple of times.  On the last return home, my owner said she didn't want me anymore....what??  Why Mom???\n\nThe kind disabled lady was now in a pinch.  She just simply could not handle a large, friendly, nosy boy like me.  She also could not afford to care for me, nor did she have room for me to stay either.  I need at least a six foot fence to keep me in.  \n\nI'm not a bad dog at all.  I just need a family who is used to having a hound dog around.  You see, we a really are a handful to keep focused once our noses get the best of us.  And, we like to share our howling, I mean singing love ballads to you.  \n\nI'm definitely a character too.  I mean, you know I like to have fun.  I like to run and play and chase the occasional raccoon.  That is my specialty you know.  I'm very trainable.  I know there are many of my ancestors out there who have won many a coon huntin' trophy or two.\n\nKids??  You have kids??  I would be the BEST thing for them!  I can keep them out of trouble and  occupied with training me, and in turn they are keeping me occupied as well!  It's a win-win people...come on!\n\nI'm sweet and handsome and kinda cuddly, but not for too long.  A guys gotta keep his image you know if he's gonna be a trophy winner.\n\nSo what do you say?  It's time to come see me and take me home.  Covid has kept your family inside too long.  Let's go!!  HOWWWWLLLLLL!!!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "This is Ginger, her name matches her perfectly because she is a beautfiul Ginger color. Do not let her intimidate you or discourage you she is just trying to get to know you. Once you spend a couple minutes with her she is the most loving and friendly dog. Once she gets to know you she is very loyal and you will create a strong bond with her. She is on the larger side and for that reason we would not like her to go to a house with small children. She will need a home that can understand her personal space but knows exactly when she wants belly rubs. She has an amazing personailty that will shine through if you take her into our play room. Ginger is around 5 years old and is looking for another chance at a forever home. She has lots of energy and will climb in your lab as she wiggles. Her previous owners say that she is good with other dogs but a meet and greet is always encouraged to insure that she is a good match with your family. She isn't a fan of the vet and has anxiety about it but she will grow to learn that the vet is a good place that will keep her healthy. She is already spayed and up-to-date on all of her vaccines. If you think Ginger would be a great addition to your life please do not hesitate to ask any questions or meet with her outside of her kennel. Meet our sweet 6 year old German Shepherd mixed breed Ginger. Ginger arrived at the shelter in 2015 as a stray from Georgetown Delaware. She was adopted in 2015 but later returned to the shelter due to her owner moving and unable to have pets where he was moving to. She came back in 2018 and has been with us ever since. Here is what we know about her. She loves the people that take care of her. She is comfortable with them. She can adjust quicker with female strangers vs male strangers even though it was a man who adopted her many years ago. Ginger is what is known as a resource guarder. Resource guarding refers to a dog displaying behavior such as growling, snapping, etc. This type of behavior is intended to convince other dogs or humans to stay away from a treasure or resource. The resource can be food, treats, toys, a place (crate), or occasionally even a person. What does all this mean? Simply put Ginger needs to get to know you first. This may take several visits for to even feel comfortable to come up to you and pet her. Even after that happens in a new home she would require the same amount of patience from her new family or potential home visitors. She would do best in a home as a single dog with older people. Small children are just not in the cards for Ginger. She is not deemed animal aggressive she just prefers not to have animals jumping on her. This pet has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated (age appropriate), microchipped, and tested for heartworm (age appropriate). They also receive monthly heartworm prevention and flea/tick while they stay with our shelter. If you are interested in seeing this pet please ask the front desk to call for a kennel tech. This is Ginger, her name matches her perfectly because she is a beautfiul Ginger color. She is the most loving and friendly dog. Once she gets to know you she is very loyal and you will create a strong bond with her. She has an amazing personailty that will shine through if you take her into our play room.

Minnie needs another dog to play with...preferably a male.  She loves to rough house and wrestle!  A big dog will not intimidate her.  Because she is a puppy she needs an owner who is not gone all day.  She needs attention.  She is spayed, current on her vaccinations and is microchipped.  We want Minnie to have a securely fenced yard to run around in.  No wrought iron or electronic fencing.  A home visit and a good vet reference are mandatory to adopt her.  Minnie will do best in a home with no kiddos.  Her adoption fee is $325.  Please fill out the online adoption application at www.russellrescue.com\n\nHer adopter must be able to drive to the Lufkin, Texas area to get her.  Contact: jamesejolley@gmail.com",

He had a sleepover with one of his Train-A-Bull team members and did so well they kept him to foster.  \n\nHe's in the rowdy \"teenager\" phase most dogs go through but is super smart, loves to be with his people, is very cuddly, is housetrained, crate trained and has done awesome only chewing on toys he is meant to chew on.  He walks great and is learning more obedience each day.\n\nHe is very dog friendly and is in training to learn how to communicate with his dog pals. His best match would be a well balanced and confident dog that could  be a role model and an owner that understands dog playstyles.  \n\nCats are unknown, but he does have a strong prey drive so we are guessing it is best to go to a cat free home.  \n\nHe's living in his foster home with a 5 year old child and does really well with her but their interactions are closely monitored by the foster mom.  \n\nHe was a stray so we don't know for sure his mix or age. He is on the smaller side, about 40 pounds and is about 12-18 months old.  \n\nAs a Train-A-Bull sponsored dog he comes with the support of a professional trainer and his foster family to help him adjust to his new home.  If you think he is a good fit for your lifestyle please contact us today at cbas_sponsorship@yahoo.com for more details and to set up a meet and greet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the COVID19 situation, the shelter is closed to the general public. If you would like to meet any of the adoptable dogs, please fill out an application online (if you are not already pre-approved) , call the shelter, and leave a message with your name and phone number and the dog you're interested in. Have patience, and they will call you back when they can. From there, a time will be scheduled for you to come and meet the dog. Please be patient, and remember they are very short staffed at the moment.\n\nApplications can be found at https://friendsofcbas.org/adopt\n",

To learn about fostering dogs like DCell, please contact us at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/volunteer/foster\n\nName: D-Cell (pka Diesel)\n\nBreed: Great Dane\n\nApproximate Age: 2 years\n\nApproximate Weight: 108 pounds\n\nCurrently Living at: Local foster home\n\n \n\nMeet D-Cell! D-Cell is a gorgeous lanky Great Dane who picked up by animal control after he was found wandering the streets as a stray. Animal control was able to locate his owners, but sadly, they did not want him back because he has previously escaped a number of times. This handsome Houdini would do best with a family who has a tall, secure fence. DCell has no leash manners so needs an adopter committed to working with him on that and who doesn\u2019t rely on leash walks for the time being. D-Cell is a friendly, happy guy who does well with other dogs and is super affectionate! D-Cell likes to rest his head on his human's shoulder and lean up against them for pets and love! D-Cell loves kids, but he doesn't understand that he shouldn't play rough with them, so he's not a good match for a family with young children.\n \nD-Cell is still working on house and crate training, and he seems to have had next to no training, so he needs a family who will enroll him in obedience training ASAP and get to work on his manners. He puts anything and everything in his mouth and he likes to rearrange his foster's house and sometimes enjoys gnawing on furniture when he's bored, so he'll need to be crated when his family is out of the house. D-Cell is very food motivated, but he's not the brightest bulb, so he needs some time to pick up new cues. At just 2 years old, he's still got a lot of puppy in him and he's certainly not aware of his size! D-Cell could afford to put on a couple pounds and he may still have some growing to do, but he's on the small side for a Dane. Don't doubt his strength, though, because this boy is STRONG! D-Cell will make a wonderful companion for a loving forever family willing to put in the work to teach him to be a good canine citizen. Apply today to meet D-Cell! \n \n\nD-Cell needs a foster or a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on him. Please open your heart and home to D-Cell!\n\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $300, which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the application online at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire\n\n \n\nThank you for considering adoption and helping to save a life!\n \n\nPlease visit us online at www.DogsXLRescue.org",

CONTACT THE PERSON LISTED IN THE BIO BELOW:\n\nMoose is not only handsome but friendly, loyal and the perfect companion. He is 8 years old and seeking a loyal family or couple that has a nice yard (fenced) and just wants to soak up life . He is healthy and ready to be your sidekick.

My humans here take very good care of me but I long for a family of my own. I share my life with many dogs here and that is cool, but i\u2019m getting older and want a slower life style.

            "description": "RHUMBA - 4 years old, 50 pounds, house trained, great with adults and children, no other pets, playful, active, will go after other dogs when they walk by,\n\nRhumba aka Callie has been in and out of the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center several times. Her perfect family seems elusive up to this point but we are sure the perfect match is still out there. Rhumba is a sweet and friendly girl. She loves humans, old and young. She is great with humans, loves attention, loves to play, and loves to be near her humans. She does not, however, like other animals. On a walk, she will bark and try her best to get at other dogs if she sees them. She will need a family ready and prepared to hold her tight when another dog walks or runs by. Management is key in situations like this. Rhumba should remain at a distance where she holds her focus on you, not the other dog. You, as her owner, will have to be prepared to find that certain distance from where Rhumba's focus remains on you and not the other animal. Treats help and with her round belly, it's clear she is motivated by treats! Daily walks and/or runs would do her good, again realizing that you'll have to manage her behavior if you see another dog. Other than that, Rhumba is a loving and carefree girl who just wants to be at her humans' side. She's waiting at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center. Call us at 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page to make an appointment to meet her. We are located at 341 S Birdneck Road and are open daily except for Tuesdays.",

She came to us covered in scars and you could tell she had been bred multiple times. From the looks of how she came in, we assume she was a breeder dog that spent most of her life (if not all) in a kennel to pop out litters when wanted. How she became a stray, we have no idea. Her legs are still scarred up but she has no issues. She loves anything and everything. She definitely has a momma personality. \n\nPlease give this girl a shot. She has a bark that can sound mean but she has a heart of GOLD. She loves belly rubs and dragging her tummy across the grass. She wants to be in your lap and hasn\u2019t figured out that she isn\u2019t a small dog. She adores kids and other dogs. She would probably be good with cats (she just hasn\u2019t been tested yet). \n\nShe isn\u2019t flashy but she is full of love and we think that is even better!!\n\nGive us a call or send us a message and let\u2019s set up a meet and greet today!! You won\u2019t regret it!",

If you have a question or inquiry please email us at tlrapplications@gmail.com\nLeo is a 6 month old, 5 lb Chihuahua. He is friendly with both people, and other animals. He adores being with his person, whether it is sitting in a lap, or patiently waiting curled up in a bed. Leo is doing fantastic with house training and will use a pee pad during the night, or on really cold days. We want for Leo to be in a home where his person is home more often than not, or he would love to be able to travel with you wherever you go! Leo is not a barky chi. Not only is he super adorable, but he has a big personality to match. He will quickly steal your heart, and a tiny little spot in your bed.\n1/27/21 2:20 PM",

Hatchi is a great contender for agility or trick training as he loves having a job and pleasing his humans. He does great meeting new people and has never met a stranger. Hatchi does well with other dogs after proper introductions though he would also enjoy a home as an only dog where the focus is entirely on him! Hatchi loves the car, peanut butter, chewing on deer antlers, being brushed and following his humans around the house. There\u2019s not much he doesn\u2019t like apart from hands near his food. This young Pyr craves human attention and is looking for humans that can provide him structure and help correct him when he gets over excited and mouthy when playing (he has some basic training and takes correction well). Hatchi will do best in a home with older children that understand how to reinforce good behavior. Hatchi\u2019s Pyrfect family has the time to spend with him going for walks and keeping his mind active and focused so he can live up to his full potential! Most of all, he\u2019s looking for that special human that wants to hang out all the time and give him all the love and attention he craves. If Hatchi sounds like the right fit for your family, apply for this fun-loving boy today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Although we currently only have this one picture of him, we can still tell that he\u2019s a looker!  Harley is about 2 \u00bd years-old and his dad, sadly, passed away recently.  Harley is now in need of a new home and we\u2019re hoping to help him find just that!\n\nHarley has been staying with his late dad\u2019s friends, but they have no experience with dogs and realize that they\u2019re just not the right home for him.  The family isn\u2019t sure how Harley does with strangers, kids, or dogs, but they do know that he likes to go after small animals and he\u2019s a strong, excited pup, so he\u2019ll need an experienced family who can help him learn boundaries and appropriate socialization skills. \n\nPlease help us get sweet Harley into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Harley, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

            "description": "Hey friends! I'm Damon and I am a 3 year old terrier mix. Like many others looking for love I have some baggage from my past. I spent the first years of my life outside with many other dogs and little human attention. Because of this it takes me a little while to trust people and new dogs. I have been with my foster mom now for a couple months and am starting to really show her who I am. I have learned it is ok to share my space and toys with other dogs. I really like to run around and play with dogs who are a little bigger with me who have energy. Once I am done playing I like to nap on the couch cuddled up with foster mom. I walk well on leash and stick next to foster mom checking in with her throughout the walk. Some of my favorite things are food, eating fresh snow, playing with toys and barking at animals and people outside. Foster mom says I am still working on learning some of the basics but that I am a really sweet and fun boy. My foster family has helped me learn what it is like to be loved and part of a family and I am ready to find my forever home. Could it be you?\n\nIf you would like to meet Damon please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.",

She is around 2-years old, 40 pounds, and came in with a puppy, (not hers) both of whom were removed as part of a neglect case.  She would sleep curled around him and even let him eat all he wanted before eating herself. Come meet Taylor!  She deserves a loving home!\n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

            "description": "FROM THE FOSTER: I wanted to give you a quick update on Chip. He is doing very well and is a pleasure to have around the house. He is the perfect child - seen, but not heard when people have been in the house. He investigates, says hello and then goes and lies under the kitchen table or in his kennel.\n\nHe is good when we go outside and will always go to the bathroom. He drank a lot of water one day and he wanted to go outside to pee about 2 hours after he had been out, so he went and stood by the door and kept looking at me to be let out. He is smart. My cat is used to having a dog around so she just stepped in and took over, proceeding to snuggle into Chips bed. He was a bit afraid of her at first, but now they are buddies and sleep close to each other; he under the kitchen table on the rug and she close by in the chair.\n\nWe have been going for short walks. He starts out perky and is excited to go out, but by the time we get back, he is walking slower and behind me. He may be getting tired because he is moving his whole body when he walks, not just his legs, although he is never panting, but, out in the backyard, when he has just gone outside, if there is a squirrel around, he will chase it. Thats all for now on our boy. He is a good dog!\n\nORIGINAL POST: Chip is a six (6) year old lab mix who was picked up wandering on the side of the road and taken to a shelter. He has a neurological issue that impairs his ability to walk normally. In addition, he came in with a large stick wedged between his upper teeth that grew into the roof of his mouth and punctured his nasal cavity. Hes been treated by an oral surgeon and everything is fine now, but his bill was close to $10,000 and we still have a $3,000 MRI to diagnose his neurological issue. Luckily, Chip has a wonderful foster who is committed to seeing him through all of his treatment, which Chip has handled like a champ with a smile on his face. If you would like to foster to adopt Chip, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

Peanut is very puppy and needs a guardian who will commit to obedience training. He also has high energy who would benefit from living with an active family, especially joggers. He's learning to socialize with other dogs and does OK with dog-savvy cats, but supervision is recommended. Peanut is a little bundle of doggy play-doh just waiting for the right family to mold him into a great family companion. Adoption fee $350. Contact Karen Mellis at hikingdal@gmail.com for further information. If interested in this dog, please go to www.dalmatianrescueco.org and submit an application for adoption. Under Adoptions, please read our adoption policy. We must have an application before we can begin the adoption process and each dog does have foster contact listed.",

            "description": "Melvin is a nearly 2-year old, adorable Pit Bull Terrier who was scheduled for euthanasia in a St. Joe shelter before Muddy Paws saved him. He is very sweet, has a goofy personality, and loves to cuddle. Playing with children makes Melvin happy so he hopes for some kids in his new home. He enjoys playing fetch and going for walks. He is a fast learner and has learned several commands while in his foster home. He is housetrained and crate trained. A home without other pets would be best for Melvin. He is very reactive to male dogs.\n\nBefore applying to adopt this dog, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Melvin is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.\n\nGazing into Kae's soulful amber eyes tells you without words that she is an old soul restored to a vital body. One meaning for 'Kae' is 'keeper of the keys' and having known her for a little while, she has already started gathering the keys to her caregivers' hearts, so we are certain she will collect and treasure the keys to her forever family's hearts quickly as well!\n\nKae's photo shows her offering the excellent eye contact so important to training success. This focus combined with her eager to please attitude, and all you will need to add are the best possible treats in the whole wide world. Then the sky will be your limit when continuing to build her skills together.\n\nKae will enjoy a hike on the trail as much as a quiet afternoon lounging in her sunny back yard. She's not one for the hustle and bustle of city life and will thrive on the predictable routines others might find a tad, well, almost boring.\n\nKae has a foundation of basic obedience, beginning exposure to agility, early leash skills (tempered by youthful enthusiasm); she is crate trained and housebroken.\n\nKae would prefer a forever home with a private back yard so she can run and play to her heart's content and rest with limited distractions. Kae can be environmentally sensitive to some loud sounds. If you are interested in learning more details about Kae, please contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com",

            "description": "Ivan is a very sweet boy who didn't have the easiest start to life. When he came to Labs and More he was very sick and never received proper puppy socialization. Now he is 100% better and is single and ready to mingle! Around 7 months old, Ivan is likely a Lab mix and he's currently on track to be a big dog when he's done growing! He is shy and wary with new people and will need a family that recognizes it will take a little time and patience to help him settle in. However once he does, he becomes a happy, silly boy that loves to romp and play. Ivan is fostered with several other dogs and does great with them. Due to his size and typical puppy rambunctiousness when playing, he can be a little much for the smaller, less active dogs in his foster home so he would love a home with an equally playful dog sibling. He enjoys playing with tug toys and running around the yard. He bonds closely with his people and likes to crawl up in his foster mom's lap for attention. He will need a family that continues to work on socialization and training with him so he can be the best boy he can be. Ivan is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Ivan, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Meet the Coffee Bean Pups! We think these cuties are Boxer and Terrier mixes and are around 4 months old. They are super excited to find families they can snuggle and snooze with. Their mama, Coffee Bean, is a little Shepherd and Terrier mix who weighs around 35 lbs. We don't know who dad is or what exactly these pups are mixed with but we think these adorable little ones are going to grow up to be similar in size as mom. Java is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

The home that adopts Ranger is going to be pretty lucky. This guy is already house and crate trained AND he knows all his basic commands plus some! He still needs a little work on the leash when a scent catches his nose, but he is 100% on everything else! I am guessing the reason he knows all his commands is because he is a darn smart pup, willing and ready to learn even more fun tricks and commands.\n\nOh and did I mention that he has a nub!? Who doesn't love a pup with a little nub that wiggles when they are happy to see you. Get those applications in because he won't be waiting around long!\n\nIf you think RANGER, is the boy for you, please visit www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/ to complete an application.",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

She had a fracture in both legs one at the hip and the other at the knee.  Zara has had orthopedic surgery and has fully recovered.  She runs and plays like any other dog her age. You would never guess she ever had a fracture.  It's so wonderful to see a pup that couldn't walk, running around like all dogs her age. She is likely around 8 to 10 months now and ready for her forever home.  She will be spayed prior to finalizing an adoption, microchipped and vaccinated.  \n\nZara is in a foster home with other dogs and she gets along with small and large breeds. She is not good with cats! She weighs around 50 to 55lbs and we believe she is near her adult size.  She is house broken and lets you know when she needs to go out.  She is a pup so she will need exercise and chew toys.\n\nIf you are interested in this gorgeous girl, please email us some information about your household and experience with pets.  \n\nThank you for considering Zara to be part of your family.",

He doesn't seem so interested in toys, but wants to romp and play with humans and seems to want to play with our other dogs!  The person who found him kept him for several days, hoping to find his owner.  There was an older dog with health issues in the home, and Tioga's energy level  was a little too much for the other dog, so Tioga is currently housed at Del Norte Animal Control, waiting for a new home!  Tioga can be pretty vocal when he wants attention, and when put into an enclosure, his first order of business is to check the perimeter to see if there are any weaknesses, so he will need a secure environment.  Tioga has a great personality and is ready for fresh start in a new home!\nCome check out Tioga and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nPlease call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

He was living on the streets just trying to survive and has scars to prove it.  But he is gentle and easy going.  He has a serious underbite and a very long tail that almost touches the ground.

He is super sweet, playful, gets along with dogs and cats but is grumpy. You have to earn his trust and learn his signs, he gives you plenty of warning to leave him alone. He does well in a crate, will protest at first then he is fine but... do not reach in his crate, do not put him in or take him out or you may loose a finger, so far he has not bitten me but he warns me to leave him alone.

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Dakota\n\nBreed: Mixed\n\nApproximate Age: 4-5 months\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight: 20 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $475\n\nWhy in Rescue: Transfer from Texas\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nDakota came from Texas hoping to find a wonderful home in Wisconsin. While she was scared at first, she is a happy girl now. We don't have a history on her, so don't know if she has been working on housetraining or how she is with children. We don't know her mix, her paperwork says Boxer mix, but we don't really see that other than her super cute underbite. Many of the dogs from Texas are true mixed breeds - a little of this and a little of that, and that is most likely what Dakota is. If interested in meeting Dakota, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will let you know if you are approved to meet her.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

He is between 10-14 months old but life thus far hasn't done him any justice. Bryce needs to be in a home with older children and a home that doesn't have a lot of visitors as he is protective of his family. Bryce shouldn't be with small animals and would be best with as an only dog or with potentially a submissive female. His current trainer will include training sessions with his adopter to continue on his improvements but needs that special someone who is willing to love him and give him the life that he deserves. He overall is a great boy just needs a savvy doberman owner to understand him! \nTraining will be mandatory with the trainer that Bryce did board and train with. An appointment must be setup and kept with his trainer in the Denver area. \n\nAll animals adopted from us are fully vetted including spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, heartworm test and deworming. Please email us at HookedOnDobies@gmail.com, visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/savingdobermankind or webpage https://www.savingdobermankind.org to request an application, inquire about an adoption fee, or to learn more! \n\nWe do require a completed adoption application to be submitted before discussing details of a specific Doberman. \n\nWe DO NOT have a central location, out foster homes are located throughout our geographic region including CO, WY, NM and TX.\n\nWe strive to PROTECT the privacy of out fosters.

            "description": "Meet Willow! \n\nFox and Willow are neutered  male and spayed  female 1 year old Australian Shepherd mixes (per paperwork). We have determined them to be a bonded pair that should be adopted together. They came from a not so great past which causes them to be timid and a bit shy at first. The great thing is, they are still so sweet. They  want to trust humans, they  really do. They will let you carry them, pet them and hang out next to them.  They feel very comfortable around dogs. They are  content laying with them and watching all that goes on in a new place. They are crate trained and are very quiet dogs. Fox and Willow are beautiful and the perfect size for most households. Since they do need a patient beginning, apply for them because you are that home not because they are  gorgeous. A fenced yard is required for them. Fox and Willow don't like a leash much right now probably because we were told that their family was  dragged into animal control by their necks. Its amazing that Fox and Willow  still want to trust people, but they do. They are  going to be the best dogs for a lucky person, couple  or family.  Apply if you think you are their  match. ? You won't be disappointed...these dogs are  special.\n\nInterested in meeting Willow? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Meet Fox! \n\nFox and Willow are neutered  male and spayed  female 1 year old Australian Shepherd mixes (per paperwork). We have determined them to be a bonded pair that should be adopted together. They came from a not so great past which causes them to be timid and a bit shy at first. The great thing is, they are still so sweet. They  want to trust humans, they  really do. They will let you carry them, pet them and hang out next to them.  They feel very comfortable around dogs. They are  content laying with them and watching all that goes on in a new place. They are crate trained and are very quiet dogs. Fox and Willow are beautiful and the perfect size for most households. Since they do need a patient beginning, apply for them because you are that home not because they are  gorgeous. A fenced yard is required for them. Fox and Willow don't like a leash much right now probably because we were told that their family was  dragged into animal control by their necks. Its amazing that Fox and Willow  still want to trust people, but they do. They are  going to be the best dogs for a lucky person, couple  or family.  Apply if you think you are their  match. ? You won't be disappointed...these dogs are  special.\n\nInterested in meeting Fox? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

When you meet him you are instantly in love with his sweet face, likely due to his large overbite - or tiny chin. He likes to be close at all times, and will even give you a nudge for a pet or just simply sit in front of you so he can stare at you lovingly. If you ignore him, he will be content with sitting or lying in proximity to you. This boy is medium energy. Inside the house, Roux loves to relax and when outside he is curious and loves to sniff around. He is dog social with calm dogs matching his energy level. He is currently in training with our guys in our Prison Training Program, brushing up on his crate training and house training. If you're looking for a chill best friend, Roux is your boy!",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Susie Q\nSize: ~Medium range: 26-60 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip\n\n**\nSusie Q is a three-legged dog (tri-paw'd). To understand how to help, view this link: https://www.thesprucepets.com/three-legged-dogs-4177794\n\nSusie Qis such a sweet girl!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n1/23/21: Susie Q has made so much progress in the last month! She has potty training down, and she hasn't had an accident inside in weeks. She also sleeps through the night and goes to the bathroom right away when we let her out in the morning.\n\nShe can be very energetic and playful, and it has helped her to have our dog as a playmate. They do get rough at times! She loves playing with toys as well. When calm, she loves to sleep on her dog bed or cuddles up next to one of us. Susie Q is a big cuddler. When new people come over, she does tend to get very energetic and barks, but does calm down after a while and does fine. We have had a few kids over and Susie Q does fine with them. She has started to nip a little bit when she gets excited or wants to play, so we are working on that.\n\nOverall, we still really enjoy having Susie Q. She is a great companion and loves being around people! I think she would benefit from another dog playmate as well.\n\n12/13/2020: Susie Q has been with us for a few weeks now, and she has definitely made some progress! She now goes up and down the stairs with no issues. Our current dog and Susie Q still get along really well and love to play together. She has gotten more used to our cat and leaves her alone most of the time. We go on walks daily and she does dart around a little bit but has started to get the hang of it. She is becoming more independent and loves chewing on bones/kongs with frozen peanut butter.\n\nWe are still working on potty training with Susie. She does well during the day when we are home because we take her out every couple of hours. We are working on crate training her when we are at work. She has had a few accidents while we are gone, but she sleeps most of the day and doesn't get into anything. She sleeps in our room at night, and we still have to take her out a couple of times a night.\n\nOverall, Susie Q is such a lover and loves any and all attention! She has been a fun dog to have around and would love a home with a dog to play with and lots of time and attention to give.\n\n12/2/2020: Susie Q has been such a fun dog! She gets along really well with our current dog. They love to play together, even with only 3 legs, she sure keeps up! She shows a lot of interest in our cat and wants to play with her, but she is easily redirected away from her.\n\nSusie Q loves to cuddle and be around her humans. She can be calm and cuddly a lot of the time, but she still does have puppy energy and loves to run around play. She likes to play with squeaky toys and tug-of-war. She also does well on walks. Susie Q was struggling with going up the stairs for the first week due to only having 3 legs. With some practice and help from us, she is starting to get the hang of it and has gone up the stairs all by herself a few times!\n\n11/14/2020: Susie Q is very sweet and loving. She loves attention. We are working on kennel training and potty training. She has a bit of separation anxiety and needs someone who can be patient with her. Susie Q is an amazing dog and perfect for any family.

            "description": "Charlotte is a senior GSD Mix. She is wonderful with people and children. She is very soft mouthed when taking treats and does not nip.  She is perfectly house broken and will let you know when she needs to go out. She knows sit, down, the hand signal for lay down, and paw (shake).  \n\nFor her age, she is in excellent health.  Still wants to play ball, or just sleep with it him her mouth.  She is also a great couch potato if you want to snuggle up.  Charlotte needs to be the only pet in the house. She has gotten along with other dogs her size. Her last buddy a Pitbull boxer mix was adopted, and her other friend, a female St Bernard passed of cancer.  She initially did not take well to the ST Bernard coming to the house, but after a few short interactions, she was good friends with her.  She cannot be with small animals, because like many other breeds, she does have prey drive.  She is not good with cats or small dogs.  She is 12 years old. We believe she still has several years ahead of her. She is still playful and strong loves her toys.  Her teeth are in excellent shape and aside from being a bit stiff when initially getting up, she gets around well.  She can still run, and is not in anyway having mobility issues other than stiffness initially (kinda like me) :).  \n\nThis girl is super sweet and affectionate and has lived with small children with no issues at all.",

Rubble unfortunately lost a leg, but he makes up for it in spirit. He is determined to explore ever nook and cranny of his overgrown backyard, and will stop at nothing until he has peed on every last inch of his fence. Rubble loves a good snuggle session on the couch. He's a lazy, laid back boy who wants a family to call his own. While he's still adjusting to the tripod life, he has some trouble peeing on his paws but we are making him do yoga to improve his balance. We are convinced he will be a paralympic sniffer in no time.",

I am a Great Pyrenees/Lab mix who came from Needy Paws Animal Shelter in Arkansas where I was surrendered with my two brothers because of a family illness. Some of my attributes are: I'm friendly and social, love people, affectionate, playful, and gentle. I greet my foster dad by jumping onto my dog house, putting my paws on his shoulders, and giving him a hug! I like water, playing with other dogs, am house trained, and I don't pull on a leash. For a 7-8 year old, I still really enjoys my walks and require them. I would do best in a rural setting as I've lived my whole life on a farm with other dogs. I don't like to share my food with other dogs so I need my own space to eat. My foster dad has not seen me around cats. I weigh about 60 lbs, and will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in the home must be 10 years of age. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

            "description": "Sundance is a 7-8 year old Great Pyrenees/Lab mix who came to us from Needy Paws Animal Shelter in Arkansas where he was surrendered with his two brothers because of a family illness. \n\nSundance is a friendly guy. He is gentle, affectionate, and playful. Sundance likes to be petted, walks pretty well on a leash, and is house trained. He does need to be fed separately as he will resource guard his food from other dogs. Sundance is dog friendly and would do best with at least one other dog in a rural setting as he came from a farm with other dogs. We haven't seen him around cats. Sundance has double dew claws, weighs about 60 lbs, and will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in the home must be 10 years or older. Sundance can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. We are able to transport to and do a proper home check in those states. If you would like to give Sundance his furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

            "description": "Senior Hearts Rescue and Renewal is the only licensed senior dog rescue organization in Western Pennsylvania. We do not have a shelter or a public facility. ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog a loving furever home.\n\nHi everyone. I\u2019m officially ready to find my furever home. I do have a few requirements. I need sunglasses, a fenced yard, and a doggie sibling. If you don\u2019t have those, I\u2019m not the guy for you. \nI\u2019m 9yrs going and weigh 12lbs. \n\nI\u2019m a friendly boy who enjoys exploring the great outdoors and going on short walks. Exercise is very important for me because it helps me stay strong and maintain my athletic build. I have some congenital issues with my front legs. I used to fall over all the time. But my Senior Hearts foster parents helped me get slim and strong so I hardly ever fall over anymore. \n\nI have to be honest about one thing. I snore a lot. And it\u2019s very loud. Sometimes it sounds like a piggy snorting. If you want to give me a furever home, you have to appreciate loud dog snoring. \n\nI like to sit in laps for for those zoom meetings and Netflix binge watching. I am crate trained and sleep like a good boy all night in my crate and when the humans leave the home. \n\nI like spending time with other dogs. But I only like dogs close to my size and dogs that aren\u2019t too rambunctious or too pushy. I can be bossy and tell off a dog that gets in my face too much. \n\nI don\u2019t want children in my home. I think they would tire me. I can be adopted within a two hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you want to meet me you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\nxoxoxo Ricky",

She arrived at the shelter after being hit by a car, and the ER vet determined she had 2 hip fractures that would require surgery and a long road to recovery. Now almost 5 months later, Cassie is completely off activity restriction and thriving. She is a fun-loving girl who wants to play with the other dogs in her foster home, run around in the yard, go for car rides, or chew on a nylabone or a peanut butter kong. When she\u2019s not romping around, Cassie insists on being a lap dog. Cassie is a very snuggly girl who wants to be curled up in bed with you or sleeping on your legs during tv time. She will settle down nicely once she\u2019s been given appropriate outlets for her puppy energy and will quietly chew on her toys. \n\nCassie enjoys walks on hiking trails or in fields, but being around traffic makes her very anxious. Because she was on activity restriction for so long, she's just now beginning work on her leash skills. \n\nCassie is crate trained, but has been left out for a few hours at a time and does fine. If crated, she prefers to be in the same room as the other dogs.  She plays nicely with other playful dogs, but can sometimes make a nuisance of herself with dogs who don't want to partake in playtime.   Although Cassie likes almost everyone she meets, she can be shy at first and needs slow introductions. Overall, Cassie is just a fun and playful pup ready to put the past behind her and move forward with a family to call her own\n\nForever home: Cassie is looking for a home with an active family that will give her all the love and attention she deserves, especially after everything she\u2019s been through. Ideally, she wouldn\u2019t have to be left alone often, and her family would be able to invest in her continued training and socialization.  She will do best with a playful canine companion.  Because of Cassie\u2019s injuries, her doctors said she will have arthritis when she\u2019s older, so having her on medication for pain management in the future is likely. Cassie requires a physically fenced yard so she can run freely and burn off her puppy energy safely.\n\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog, please complete the Adoption Application on our website, www.waggintailsdogrescue.org>Adopt>Adoption Application.\n \nADOPTION INFO:\n \nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.   We generally have two adoption events per month.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website for the date and time of the next adoption event. Arrangements can be made to meet a dog outside of Saturday adoption events after an application is submitted and approved.\n\nOur adoption process includes an application and in-home meet-n-greet with the dog.\n\nApplications will be considered for the Southeast Michigan area.\n\nWe do not do out of state adoptions.\n\n-Adult Dog Adoption Fee - $225\n-Small Breed Adoption Fee - $275\n-Senior Dog Adoption Fee - $125\n-Pup Adoption Fee - $250 plus $50 spay/neuter deposit refunded upon proof of surgery by 6 mos.\n \nThank you for supporting dog rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Courtesy Listing!\nCourtesy dog listing, please direct all inquiries to the information provided within the bio below (CBCR does not warranty any information provided about courtesy dogs listed)\n\nAbout Ollie:\n\nSex: Male\nAge:\u00a05 years old\nCoat: Black and white, medium length\nWeight: 65 lbs\nActivity Level:\u00a0Active Pet\nHouse Trained, Neutered, Current on Vaccination\n\nBiography\nI rescued Ollie from a local animal shelter in February 2016. At that time he had been taken in as a stray and appeared to have been attacked as he had a hematoma on his chest and drains in his legs from the wounds. He still looked so happy even though he\u2019d been through so much. I took my now 13 y/o beagle mix to meet him at the shelter and they\u2019ve been buddies ever since. After adopting Ollie, he was heartworm positive so I treated him and then had him neutered. Pre-neuter he would jump my small fence in backyard but not after. He is not much of a barker but will bark if something goes bump in the night. He\u2019s anxious and likes to chomp on lacrosse balls which are indestructible. He likes walks on the leash but pulls a lot. He becomes anxious when seeing another dog on a walk and is sometimes hard to control. He would do great with a lot of land or a fenced in yard. He has never chewed up things in my house. He and my beagle eat from same bowl. Ollie likes being boarded with his beagle sister and plays well with other dogs at playtime outside-mainly older dogs. He bit my friend\u2019s dog about 6 months ago when we introduced them on leashes. Her dog was an energetic shepherd mix with a loud bark. I recently moved to dog friendly apartment complex. He enjoys walks but is still anxious around the dogs. This morning Ollie nipped and broke skin on my neighbors arm when she reached out to pet him. He has never bitten me or any child but I cannot take a chance on him doing that here. Ollie likes attention but he is not a lap dog. He sleeps in the living room during night. He enjoys looking out window and sleeping during day.\n\nDoes the dog have any history of aggression such as growling, lunging, snapping or biting any adult or child?\nYes\n\nPlease explain the aggression toward people.\nHas never been aggressive toward any guests or children in my home. History of one bite/nip on arm as described above.\n\nDoes the dog have any history of aggression toward other animals?\nYes\n\nPlease explain the aggression toward other animals.\nDoes not like cats. Ollie has history of being attacked and will fight for himself if necessary.\n\nReason for re-homing?\nPotential risk to other residents now living in close proximity to me.\n\nLocation & Contact\nOllie is located in Bermuda Run NC.\u00a0 For more information, reach out to April at agstaley90@gmail.com or\u00a0336-403-6383.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Glory. I was left at the Yucca Valley Animal Shelter as a stray. Unfortunately, nobody came to claim me during my stray hold. During my stay at that shelter, I was very timid and fearful, so nobody was interested in adopting me. The staff of the shelter called to ask if this shelter could take me in so I would have a better chance of being adopted. Luckily, they had plenty of space and agreed to take me in. It has taken a little time, but I have come around and the staff has been able to see more of my personality. I am very relaxed and calm, and I just enjoy laying around napping, and going out to sun bathe in the yard. I would love to find a calm and loving home where I can just lounge around and relax, enjoying the good life I deserve. I get along pretty well with other dogs, but the staff is not sure how I will do with cats. I will be temperament tested with cats during my stay here, so if you have cats and are interested in adopting me, please ask staff if I have been evaluated with them yet. If you have any questions, or if you would like to come up to visit with me, please ask staff.\n                                                                                   Love,\n                                                                                     Glory",

Luckily for me, the staff of the shelter knew that I deserved more time to find my furever home, so they contacted this shelter and got me in. I am very sweet and loving, and I love to get lots of attention and go out on walks. I can be a little bratty with other dogs, but I do get along with some. I prefer males over females, but my real issue with other dogs is that I do not like alpha dogs. I might be a senior, but I am still very active and love to go out on walks and spend time with people. I have allergies, so I am on a special diet (Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Skin & Stomach), but I LOVE food! Since I have allergies, it would be best for me to go into a home with a family who can afford my special food, and will take my allergies seriously, and not give me human food and other foods that will trigger my allergies (no matter how much I beg). I have not been temperament tested with cats yet, but the staff will see how I do while I am here. If you would like to meet me outside of my kennel, or if you have any questions, please ask staff.\n                                                                                                 Love,\n                                                                                                Gretta",

We think he must also be part \u201cchow hound\u201d, because boy, does he love FOOD! He is about 50 pounds. Ralph loves to play with other dogs and people and to snuggle on the couch. He is being fostered by a family with three other dogs, three cats, and five children. He is great with the other dogs and the children but really wants to chase the cats. He would love to have a playful dog in his new home! Ralph is house trained and sleeps all night in his crate without a peep. He is sweet and goofy and his foster family loves him. Ralph is neutered, microchipped, and fully vaccinated. He is up-to-date on heartworm and flea and tick prevention. Would you like to meet Ralph? Apply at forrescue.net!",

            "description": "Panda #7160 is a beautiful 5-year-old female Border Collie mix.  Panda is very sweet, and she adapts easily to a new home. She is well behaved, affectionate, calm. She is house trained. She enjoys running around the yard, and is good with her foster family's  dog. She is happy to sit next to you and get scratches. She likes to find \"her\" spot and settle in, perhaps on a particular corner of the couch. Panda sleeps well in the crate and sleeps all night. She is great in the car. She appreciates treats but does not beg. Panda is the perfect little companion dog. Panda is an LCAR momma who came to us with Heartworms.  She was great mom to her pups and is ready for some R&R before she begins her Heartworm treatment. Panda is seeking an adopter/foster who will be able to continue LCAR\u2019s provided Heartworm treatment. She weighs 45 pounds and is full grown. If you are interested in fostering to adopt this pup, AND are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html. Keep in mind it takes 1-2 weeks for applications to be processed.  E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: Last Chance Animal Rescue #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities",

He would be the perfect friend for a low energy person or family and be a champion at Netflix marathons!\n\nConnor has osteoarthritis and spondylosis. This means he has extreme arthritis and disk problems in his spine. Connor is walking well and improving each day as we dial in his pain medication. He loves low energy activities such as moving with his person from room to room, or supervising while you putter in the yard.\n\nConnor has not been receptive to other dogs so far, so he may be best in a home without other dogs. While he is a sweetie, we also do not recommend small children. He is not always steady on his feet, and if they start pulling on him, he may snap at them out of fear. He has been great with older, respectful children. Connor has no food aggression or allergies issues. He is on pain medication and we continue to work with our vet to get the exact doses right.\n\nWhile Connor is in his senior years, we are confident that with the right family, this guy will really shine. Connor would love to talk to someone about couch snuggles today!\n\nPs - he gives the sweetest kisses!\n\nNuts and Bolts: 8 years old, male, soon to be neutered, 60lbs, no cats, unsure about dogs, older kids only, no steps, needs training, does not need a fenced yardIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

            "description": "Looks like: Australian Shepherd\nMale, 12 years old, 30 pounds\n\nRemmy is a sweet older gentleman. He is apprehensive at first and does not like to be lifted. He does snap at too forward people and so should go to a home without children and be with understanding adopters. He has quite an impressive resume otherwise -- he is great with big or small dogs and cats. He is crate trained and rides well in the car. He is a bit on the timid side at first and prefers to be left untouched until he gets used to you. He isn't described as overly affectionate with people but will warm up to you once he trusts you. \n\nRemmy did not go many places before coming to POMDR. So a walk to a busy place can be very overwhelming. He has lived a reserved life and it shows in his personality. Slow exposure is ideal for him. \n\nHe walks well on leash. He eats and sleeps in his crate - being led in by food and then settling in comfortably. Remmy does pace in the house and yard, especially during transition but then will mostly just follow his person around. He wants to be with you and is actually showing anxiety when left behind so needs help understanding being left alone is ok. He is hearing and vision impaired but has good energy for his age. He listens well but doesn't really know any commands. \n\nRemmy came to us from the Newman Animal Shelter.",

            "description": "\"Why, hello there! Thanks for visiting me online! My name is Booker and  I\u2019m a new arrival to Providence Animal Center from Arkansas. My litter mates and myself were found on the side of the road in a kennel, so can we both agree that I can\u2019t wait to move from here into my new forever home. \n\nThe staff feel that the right forever home for me will have another confident doggie roommate with a fully fenced in yard. Since I'm still learning about how wonderful everything in life can be, my ideal home will be in a quiet setting and calm inside - no city/apartment life or wild parties for me!  If you have children, kids 12+ would be great. I'd also likely do well living with a kitty friend!\n\nI'm been staying with one of PAC's fabulous fosters and they have the following to say about me:\n\n\"He's really coming out of his shell. He prefers the company of another dog, but will come to people he trusts for pets and cuddles. For potential adopters: fully housebroken, never barks, loves chew toys and bones. He loves to run and wrestle with my dog. We are working on leash skills as he is still a bit shy about fast movements and loud sounds.\"\n\nSo what do you say? I promise we will be best buds. Please send your completed adoption profile (found here:https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) to foster@providenceac.org. My paws are crossed. \n\nXO - Booker\n\nP.S. I'm a little over 1 year old, 47 pounds, neutered, microchipped and up to date on all my vaccinations.\"\n\nP.S. S. A generous donor is eager to help me find my forever home, so they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! YAY!\n\nSome of this pet's photos have been provided by Crissy Everhart Photography \n\n___\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

This handsome guy has been adjusting well in his new foster home, and has been warming up to everyone!! He really just likes to be held, (all 9 whole pounds of him) and cuddled up with his foster Dad most of the time. He also loves to curl up on his foster Dad's shoulder when laying on the couch or in the bed. Hercules does have cushings disease, but is not showing any signs or any issues. His Adopter will have to look for any signs of cushings in the future. He does not currently need on any medication for this.\n\nHis perfect furever home would be a home where he can be that lucky someone's nap companion and relax most of the day. Maybe go for an afternoon stroll to explore and smell the fresh air, and then an evening filled with belly rubs and A+ cuddling.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Jilly. I was transferred from a public shelter to this shelter because I had been there for a while, and nobody was interested in adopting me. I am very sweet and loving and I love to be around people. I am pretty high energy, so I enjoy going out on walks, and getting lots of human interaction. I am picky with other dogs, as I am a bit of an alpha female, but the staff thinks I could do well in a home with a calm, submissive dog, preferably a male. I have a bit of a high prey drive, so the staff doesn't think I would do well with cats, but they do plan on temperament testing me with cats. So, if you have cats and are interested in adopting me, please ask staff if I have been tested with them yet, and how I did with them. I would love to find an active home with a family who will give me lots of attention and take me out for lots of walks and hikes and other outdoor activities. If you would like to meet me outside of my kennel, or if you have any questions, please ask staff.\n                                                                                         Love,\n                                                                                         Jilly",

Just in time for possibly a little turkey? Unfortunately, up until now, my life has not been an easy one. I was food deprived, and as a result, extremely emaciated. I am also Heartworm positive (Stage 1) and my ears need meds too. However, the best thing about being part of the AAU family is they will provide the help and meds needed to get me well. I also will admit that I have become quite the escape artist. So, it's very important that my new family has a fenced backyard. Despite it all, I am a beautiful boy who desperately needs a family to love me. Will it be you?\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "(Pictured far right) We must say it would be hard to find a nicer boy then Cody. He is always happy and has never met a stranger! He is an unbelievably sweet 7 year old golden retriever who was taken to our local dog shelter by his family because they were moving. He is just an amazing boy who is good with other dogs and loves lots of attention! \n\nWe suspect he had a bit of a hard life as he arrived at the shelter just infested with fleas. His fleas are now gone and his hair in spots is growing back nicely. He was also thin and appeared to perhaps have issues with the cruciate ligaments in both legs. Cody saw the orthopedic vet and it was confirmed he needs to have surgery on both cruciates repaired. The estimate for his first surgery is $2,476.63. \n\nWe also found out he has a grade 5/6 heart murmur and after his ECHO was put on atenolol to make sure his heart is not working too hard. So far he is asymptomatic when it comes to the heart issue. \n\nHe was opened up for his first surgery and unfortunately the doctor found a growth. They closed him back up and now we await the results. We will keep you posted here. We thank everyone who has donated to help this dog to date. We continue to remain hopeful and to raise money for his first surgery. Thank you so much as usual for all your help for these goldens! You'll find that donation link directly to help Cody here: \nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=VRD78C79KLPBC&source=url\n\nThere will be more updates to come as we learn more about Cody. No children under the age of 10 years old with his adoption since we do not know his background.\t\n\nTo adopt a Golden that you see here, please go to the Golden Retriever Rescue Resource website at www.gr-rescue.org  Read our adoption policies. If you qualify for this dogs adoption and the adoption policies, please write us for an adoption application at grrradoption@yahoo.com  Please provide your city and zip code. Please note, we only adopt to select areas within Ohio, Michigan and Indiana where we can do a home visit by a trusted volunteer. \n\nPlease read our adoption policies on our website prior to inquiring for an adoption application.

Zeke sure is!\nZeke is a 62 lb, 1.5 year old bulldog/boxer mix with spots on his ears. \nHe was rescued from Baton Rouge and brought down to New Orleans. \nZeke wants to be friends with everybody! He is great with dogs & kids, and wants to play with every cat he meets. \nHe loves to jump around, but also is very content with sleeping by your feet or on top of you (total lap dog). He is extremely intelligent and picked up learning to come, sit, and wait within a couple of days with his foster. \nHe is medium energy and would do best in a home with active parents or another dog who likes to play a lot. \nZeke is house trained. He will use his kennel, but doesn\u2019t really like it, so he will whine for the first 5 minutes, but quickly gets used to it and sleeps throughout the night. \nHe is up to date on shots, neutered and heartworm negative.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

She's still got lots of pep in her step and love in her heart and is certainly going to make a fantastic little companion. She's content with napping for parts of her day but she still enjoys going outside daily to enjoy the sun, grass, and cool breeze. She likes to be in the same room as her people but is not at all demanding. She is mobile on flat surface but cannot manage stairs or steps. Despite her vision impairment, she gets around the house quite well. She needs a quiet, adult only, home. She's good with other mild-mannered and respectful dogs and cats. She's just got such a cute little personality and is going to make someone so happy!\n\nFostered in Temecula, CA\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information about Bella, please contact Kathy:\nCall/Text: (951) 515-4077\nEmail: k.haley.hope.ranch@gmail.com",

            "description": "Fricka is an adult (6-7 years old )Alaskan Malamute female who loves attention, scratches and will do anything you ask of her for a treat! Fricka gets along with male dogs and would love nothing more than to have a family to call her own. Due to an eye infection prior to coming to RezQ Dogs, Fricka has limited eyesight and can really just see shadows. As a result, Fricka's ideal home would be quiet and children free. If you are interested in adding this stunning, laid back girl to your family, please contact us at adoptions.rezqdogs@gmail.com\n\nRezQ Dogs Adoption Policies:\n\n1. All of the dogs (and cats) adopted from RezQ Dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, de-wormed, and microchipped prior to adoption. Many of the dogs also received additional veterinary care if needed.\n\n2. RezQ Dogs houses its dogs in private foster homes and at our facility which is open by appointment only. We do require an approved application on file prior to scheduling a meet and greet with the dog. At that point, the adopters can take the dog home.\n\n3. Adoption fees are as follows:\n - $125 for dogs over 1 year of age\n - $150 for dogs under 1 year of age\n - $75 for cats\n\n4. While RezQ Dogs does allow out of state adoptions, we do limit the distance between the potential adopters and our location in Dodson, MT, to within a 12-hour drive.\n\n5. Due to our limited staff and volunteers, RezQ Dogs is unable to transport dogs to their forever homes or meet adopters part way. RezQ Dogs does not ship dogs via airlines or ground transportation. We ask the adopters to meet the dogs in person prior to adoption rather than having someone pick up the dog for them in order to ensure the right fit for both humans and dogs.\n\n6. Please fill out our online adoption application here: www.rezqdogs.org/adopt , Make sure your application is complete and all of the phone numbers are provided as INCOMPLETE applications will not be considered. You will not be contacted if any information on the application is missing. We simply lack the manpower and time to track down the information we ask for in the first place.\n\n7. RezQ Dogs makes every effort to reply to adoption inquiries and process applications within 1 week of receiving them. July 1, 2017, 8:18 pm",

            "description": "Jai is a four year old Australian Shepherd. He's not only a stunning looking boy but he's just a joy to be around due to his goofy and playful personality. Unfortunately, Jai didn't have the best opportunities so far but he's quickly making up for lost time. Jai requires a very specific kind of home that will provide him with training, socialization, and patience. Even though Jai requires a bit more than an average dog, he deserves a loving family of his own. If you think you can provide him that, please contact us at adoptions.rezqdogs@gmail.com\n\nRezQ Dogs Adoption Policies:\n\n1. All of the dogs (and cats) adopted from RezQ Dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, de-wormed, and microchipped prior to adoption. Many of the dogs also received additional veterinary care if needed.\n\n2. RezQ Dogs houses its dogs in private foster homes and at our facility which is open by appointment only. We do require an approved application on file prior to scheduling a meet and greet with the dog. At that point, the adopters can take the dog home.\n\n3. Adoption fees are as follows:\n - $125 for dogs over 1 year of age\n - $150 for dogs under 1 year of age\n - $75 for cats\n\n4. While RezQ Dogs does allow out of state adoptions, we do limit the distance between the potential adopters and our location in Dodson, MT, to within a 12-hour drive.\n\n5. Due to our limited staff and volunteers, RezQ Dogs is unable to transport dogs to their forever homes or meet adopters part way. RezQ Dogs does not ship dogs via airlines or ground transportation. We ask the adopters to meet the dogs in person prior to adoption rather than having someone pick up the dog for them in order to ensure the right fit for both humans and dogs.\n\n6. Please fill out our online adoption application here: www.rezqdogs.org/adopt , Make sure your application is complete and all of the phone numbers are provided as INCOMPLETE applications will not be considered. You will not be contacted if any information on the application is missing. We simply lack the manpower and time to track down the information we ask for in the first place.\n\n7. RezQ Dogs makes every effort to reply to adoption inquiries and process applications within 1 week of receiving them. July 1, 2017, 8:18 pm",

            "description": "Zumba, a beautiful German Shepherd mix, was born in January 2018. Zumba is a sweet and gentle little girl with a sensitive soul. Zumba truly is THE PERFECT dog. Perfectly polite with great house manners, housetrained, crate trained, great with other dogs and children. Zumba loves going for walks and walks nicely on a leash, she knows basic obedience. She's smart and learns things in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, Zumba was born with a rare genetic disorder, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In plain English, it simply means she has very fragile skin and loose joints due to the alterations to collagen structure and density. Even the slightest scratch can damage and tear her skin requiring a trip to a veterinarian to be stitched up and time in a \"cone of shame\" to allow it to heal. \nWe have no doubt that this fun, beautiful loving girl is worth every bit of effort but it would be so much better for her and her future if she were to have her happily ever after with someone who understands her medical needs and has the capability (financial and emotional) to deal with them. If you have the love and a nice soft lawn please dont let this sweet girl spend her life being the underdog here. As much as we love Zumba, we simply do not have the time to give her back all of the love she deserves. Any creature with this much happiness, this much love of life deserves more.\nPlease, if you are the reward Zumba has been waiting for, that special home, please let us know by filling out an adoption application at www.rezqdogs.org/adopt \n\nAdoption Policies:\n1. All of the dogs (and cats) adopted from RezQ Dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, de-wormed, and microchipped prior to adoption. Many of the dogs also received additional veterinary care if needed.\n2. RezQ Dogs houses its dogs in private foster homes and at our facility which is open by appointment only. We do require an approved application on file prior to scheduling a meet and greet with the dog. At that point, the adopters can take the dog home.\n3. Adoption fees are as follows:\n- $125 for dogs over 1 year of age\n- $150 for dogs under 1 year of age\n- $75 for cats\n4. While RezQ Dogs does allow out of state adoptions, we do limit the distance between the potential adopters and our location in Dodson, MT, to within a 12 hour drive.\n5. Due to our limited staff and volunteers, RezQ Dogs is unable to transport dogs to their forever homes or meet adopters part way. RezQ Dogs does not ship dogs via airlines or ground transportation. We ask the adopters to meet the dogs in person prior to adoption rather than having someone pick up the dog for them in order to ensure the right fit for both humans and dogs.\n6. Please fill out our online application at www.rezqdogs.org/adopt Make sure your application is complete and all of the phone numbers are provided as INCOMPLETE applications will not be considered. You will not be contacted if any information on the application is missing. We simply lack the manpower and time to track down the information we ask for in the first place.\n7. RezQ Dogs makes every effort to reply to adoption inquiries and process applications within 1 week of receiving them.",

At 3 years old this sweet girl has been a mom way too many times but she is safe now and will never again be used for breeding. She is a lovebug for sure. She gets along with most dogs but her mama instinct kicks in and she will correct them if they are too high energy.\nNote from Macy (12/23/20): My name is Macy! You want to pet me! I know you want to pet me. Just pet me!! Please please!! I love you so much. I love any attention I can get from my people. I want to show them how much I love them every time I see them. I am not shy. Some would say I am a confident dog. With the right motivation, A.K.A if you have my favorite treat you can get me to do things  like climb or jump but I am a bit of bull dozer and clumsy but I will try my best to perform. I do like to play hard but enjoy a nice leisure walk.",

You know the one - stage 5 clinger, sends 32 texts in a row if you don't respond within seconds, checks up on you at work... And while that behavior isn't exactly considered healthy in a romantic partnership, in a canine relationship, we 10/10 would recommend. \n\nDorian, who is about 3 years old, is totally THAT GUY. If you're sitting, he's in your lap (all 50lbs of him). If you're walking to another room, he'll pop out of nowhere to escort you. Bathroom break? Never do it alone with Dorian! We're not trying to insinuate he's stalker-ish, but we are saying you'll never be lonely with Dorian around. \n\nOk, he's a stalker. But at least he's cute! Who wouldn't want to wake up to that cute face every morning?! (Dorian also wants us to tell you he's housebroken!)\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Dorian, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Dorian, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgDorian. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

I\u2019m pretty active, too. I could go for walks and runs if that sounds good to you. Do you think I might be a good fit for your family? You do?! Well you better call the shelter!\n\nDre is fully vaccinated, neutered, and heartworm negative.

He is an all around happy boy and energetic. He has sweet kind eyes and just a fun personality. He came in and was living with Kelcie and their pups. He may be adopted with Kelcie as a bonded pair.",

This week, he found his way in the play yard because he sat patiently in kennel and gave the volunteer the saddest puppy eyes he could muster (she called them the Puss'n'boots eyes). Once outside he sat for his love, posed for a few pictures, and soaked up some sun. He didn't react to cats when he was near them. We didn't test him with other dogs. The group of dogs that he was out with weren't super friendly though Hank didn't seem bothered by them one bit. We can dog test for interested adopter or rescue upon request.\nHank is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control.

Despite his poor condition, he wanted to play with other dogs and was eager to get treats from the volunteers. He needs leash work as well as training on basic manners. He and the other dogs of the cruelty case seem to have had very little socialization, so they can be a little over eager around new dogs. None of them showed signs of aggression, they mostly wanted to play with other dogs but were too excited, which made the other dog nervous. We are confident that in time they will learn what a great life a dog can have with proper care. Can you help Ham get a new leash on life?\n\n \n\nHam is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control.

            "description": "Poor Dudley was breaking our hearts on Saturday. He is in such poor condition: skin issues, eye issues, malnourished .. you name it. We are hopeful that he will start to look and feel better in the shelter, but he could flourish even more in a foster home! Despite his condition, Dudley was a perfect gentleman during his time in the yard. He did well with Lucy, a German Shepherd mix, and was such a sweetheart around volunteers. He kept giving us sweet eyes for more treats and we, of course, obliged every time. Help Dudley on his road to a better life by applying to foster or adopt today!\n\nDudley is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control. He will be vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped upon placement in an adoptive or foster home. To adopt, complete the adoption application at AAVArescue.com.",

When you hear the word pinky, the first things that come to mind are cute and precious and fun. I am definitely all of that and I need a home that will love me forever. When you first meet me, you will see that mas a little rough and I didn't know what it was like to have a warm bed and food and a kind hand. But thanks to being rescued by the shelter team, I am getting to have the basics every dog should have....and so much more. I will greet you with a tail wag and want you to pet me and try to sit in your lap. I am super smart and know commands and learn a new one every day. I have great leash manners and only pull if I see a four-legged friend I want to meet. But I haven't had good dog socialization yet so it's best to redirect me which is easy with treats. My sense of trying new things and liking them is incredible. Puppichino....omg, I love one every day and I am such a dainty eater. Swimming pool float....gotta take a nap on one. Car ride....head out the window time!\n\nI would love a quiet home as the only dog where I could go for walks, hang in the yard and take a sunbath when it is cool. I need help to put on some weight that I need and someone to snuggle with. What is not to LOVE?? Email us at foster@maricopa.gov to meet this amazing dog!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4499575.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "PHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

At 22 lbs, he is the perfect size for it! And who can resist that face!\n\nDiesel has an ongoing medical condition. He was diagnosed with a disc disease causing paralysis of his two rear legs, but that hasn't affected Diesel's positive attitude. He still is full of energy and wants to be love on his people. He has gone through stem cell therapy in hopes that he would regain movement, but the procedure was not successful. He may do well with a wheelchair. Dogs are so resilient, and Diesel still has so much love to give and get that he deserves a chance.\n\nDiesel is the most loyal and loving dog you will find. If you have the time and the means to care for this lovebug, set up a time to meet Diesel.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

But the best thing about Brick is his WIGGLE BUTT. He would like a home with no larger dogs.\n\n\n\nThank you so much for your inquiry. Our sweet Hard Knocker is currently available for adoption. Our process in adopting out our dogs begins with an adoption application. Please complete this form on our website using the following link, https://www.hkrtinc.com/adoption-form. \n\nOnce you have submitted your application, please allow up to 72 hours for a response. Once approved, you will be contacted to set up a meet and greet. Submitting an application does not guarantee an adoption. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis. We want our dogs to find the perfect home. We also want to do our best to find the perfect matched dog for your home. \n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the pup you have inquired about, please feel free to email directly to hkrtrescue@gmail.com.\n\n\nThank you so much for your support and for helping us #dowhatsrightnotwhatseasy.\n\n",

I am special needs so I really must have a home without young children, since I can't hear them and they can startle me. I have a ton of energy, so I will make a great walking or jogging companion. I really dislike cats and I absolutely cannot be in a home with any feline friends. I can be dog friendly but I always need a proper introduction to new dogs so that I can get to know them with my other senses. I'm really not a fan of dog parks, probably because again, I cannot hear dogs coming and they can scare me easily. Additionally, because I cannot hear what's going on around me, I tend to be a little bit more protective over my space and my humans. I am house broken and am very good at letting you know that I need to go outside. I ask for a little bit of patience when introducing me to new surroundings, but I am a quick learner and as long as you take the time to settle me in properly, I will do just fine. We could both benefit with hand signal training to work on knowing my commands. People at the ranch say that I am really sweet. I also love to chase lights for fun, devour my food, and would love to be your new best friend!",

            "description": "MEET WATSON!!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. For more information, please email: amy.farner@gmail.com.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in. (Please know this is not a guarantee).\n\nIf you have any questions about adopting a new dog into your home or have any issues that may arise in those first few days, weeks or months, please e-mail our adoption associate, amy.farner@gmail.com and she will help you through the process. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nWatson is a very shy guy that is slowly adjusting to shelter life. Watson was brought to the shelter by a good samaritan who found him in the neighborhood and found him to be very hungry and thirsty. He's had a rough start to his young life. The kennel staff is working with Watson on his leash skills and he's getting better. He likes to go out to the play yard and even enjoyed playing with a friendly, female dog. He's even been doing \"zoomies\" around the yard and will come up to the kennel staff to get some pets and treats. However, Watson is startled easily by sudden movements or when people walk by that he doesn't know.\n\nWatson needs a patient adopter that understands he is scared of sudden movements and will need to give him the time and patience to adapt to a new home. Watson should not go to a home with small children. Older, considerate kids would be okay. If you think Watson would be a good fit in your home, please come and meet him today!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4493710.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

He LOVES to jump and can achieve apx 4' high and straight up!  REGGIE does not like some of our other male dogs but that is typical for the male dogs here.  Seems housetrained and very routine driven we believe he is a Healer staffy mix.  LOVES to play in our exercise area, stop in for a visit and see why he is so loved by us here!",

Our sweet Hard Knocker is currently available for adoption. Our process in adopting out our dogs begins with an adoption application. Please complete this form on our website using the following link, https://www.hkrtinc.com/adoption-form. \n\nOnce you have submitted your application, please allow up to 72 hours for a response. Once approved, you will be contacted to set up a meet and greet. Submitting an application does not guarantee an adoption. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis. We want our dogs to find the perfect home. We also want to do our best to find the perfect matched dog for your home. \n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the pup you have inquired about, please feel free to email directly to hkrtrescue@gmail.com.\n\n\nThank you so much for your support and for helping us #dowhatsrightnotwhatseasy.",

            "description": "Looks like: Piebald Dachshund Mix\nFemale, 10 years old, 18 pounds\n\nPeanuts is a shy girl at first but once she feels safe, she blossoms and becomes sweet with the people around her. She really is a love and feeds off positive attention. She gets along with other dog friends and accepts getting pets from new people, but is overall wary of new situations. She is currently overweight and needs help from her person to regulate her food and get her out for walks to shed some pounds. She is good on leash and a nice little walking companion but her timidness may strike in certain situations and she could be cowering, hiding behind her person, and refusing to go. She needs help gaining confidence. \n\nPeanuts will benefit from have a secure yard and even more so if she has constant access to it. She is a delight and will dance for food, attention, and her way into your heart. She is great with cats, being able to live and share space with them or ignoring them all together on walks. \n\nPeanuts does have Pituitary Cushing's and needs to be on medication for the rest of her life to keep her hormones balanced. \n\nPeanuts came to us after her guardian moved into the hospital for an undetermined amount of time and could no longer care for her.",

If you feel Buddy is a good fit, please fill out the online adoption application found at www.collierescuenetwork.com. Please read our adoption process found at the same website before applying.  There is a $400 adoption fee for all dogs adopted through Collie Rescue Network.  \n\nName:  Buddy\nAge:  2-3 years\nGender: Male \nDogs: No (no dogs in the home, no dogs visiting)\nCats: Yes, dog-savvy cats are fine (he sometimes like to play chase)\nKids: age 16+ only\nMedical: Season allergies (requires medication 1-2 months in late fall, approx. $75/month for 2 months)\n\nOur boy Buddy needs a very special home.  He needs someone who is dedicated to him and love him even with his quirks (because he will, guaranteed, love you despite yours!). Once Buddy settle in and knows he is home, he is just the sweetest boy. He is very affectionate and loves nothing more than being with his humans. Hanging out with you as you putter around the house, helping you keep the squirrels away from the porch, snuggling on the couch at night to catch up on your favourite TV shows.\n\nBuddy is not a fan of other dogs at all.  A dog free home is necessary for him to continue to be a happy boy. He will not be a candidate for dog parks or doggie visitors. But being the only dog in the home is a great way to bond with him and make it All About Buddy, which really, is what he deserves. He is fine with dog savvy cats who will understand that Buddy does, occasionally, think it\u2019s great fun to play chase.\n\nBuddy will do best in a more rural area that is fairly quiet. He can get overly-excited by cars, trucks, too many people, and so on. In his current foster home, in a quiet area he is doing really well and is nice and calm. Due to his reactivity in busy areas, Buddy has a bite history \u2013 he\u2019s done loads of work now with a great behaviourist and has come a long way!  He is ready to start his search for that perfect furever family.  He needs a family who is understanding about his past, who is willing to continue to work with the behaviourist (the rescue will pay for 4 sessions, which should be more than enough), and who understands that this truly lovely little boy just wants to be someone\u2019s Best Buddy.\n\nPlease take the time to fully read Buddy\u2019s bio before applying.

I also have a micro chip. Before I came to the SPCA I lived in a home  with dogs, cats, and kids. I like to play and wrestle with my siblings and older dogs. I had an accident in April and had two surgeries and now  have a pin in my leg. I am good shape now and it has not slowed me down.   I love attention and can be a litter hyper. I love to give kisses and go for walks. If you would like to meet me please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online application and someone from the office will give you a call and set up an appointment so you can meet me and see how great I am.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150\nHeart Worm Negative\n41 Pounds \n10 Months Old\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.

He\u2019s also housetrained, crate trained, and leash trained! Max\u2019s Pyrfect home consists of an active family that will take him on nice long walks. Max needs a secure 6 ft fence as he takes his guarding duties very seriously and will easily clear a smaller fence to protect his humans from the dangerous squirrels :) Max seems to bark a bit less than a normal Pyr without sacrificing one bit of Pyr handsomeness with his beautiful, fluffy coat (he's possibly mixed with Golden Retriever). Max loves meeting new people but we are unsure about the little ones. A home with no other small critters would be best, since Max is easily distracted by them. He would enjoy a similar sized canine companion to show him the ropes of his new home. He can be protective of his food but otherwise has done well with dogs of similar size. He will happily relax in the corner of the room while you work and then eagerly jump in the car when it\u2019s time for an adventure! Max is a very affectionate boy, looking for the right family to love. If that sounds like your family, apply for Max today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits.

His mother died when he and his siblings were born for unknown reasons so they had to be fed by their rescuer.  \n\nAndy is a very playful little guy and like all puppies can get into everything.  He is a healthy boy who loves to run, is very affectionate and loves to sit on your lap.  . He\u2019s also a very sociable guy, is used to living among multiple dogs, so would do well in a home with a back yard and another dog to play with. \n\nIf you are looking for a real cutie, have lots of patience and understand that he is still a puppy, you will have yourself a wonderful, beautiful little dog.  Arnold has all of his shots and has been neutered.\n",

I also have a micro chip. I am an older dog that was left all alone when my owner passed away. I have been to the doctor and was given  a clean bill of health. If you are looking for a laid back, sweet, lovable dog I am your gal!  If you would like to meet me please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online application and someone from the office will give you a call and set up an appointment so you can meet me and see how great I am.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150\nHeart Worm Negative\n8 Pounds\n10 years Old\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.  Screening and approval by our Adoption Coordinators and a home visit  may be required to make sure  this pet fits into your home and the home fits our pet.\n\nCONTACT US:If you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531 or drop by our Adoption Center located at 620 Zeigler Circle W, Mobile, AL 36608 - Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!</strong> </strong>This wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity.\n\nThank you!",

Many changes in the family happened in a very short period and Clifford got thrown away. Apparently big guys like him aren't allowed to show their emotions, they aren't allowed to need extra care, they aren't allowed to feel unstable when their whole world is ripped apart, instead he got dumped in a boarding facility as fast as they could get him there. Not even a glance back at this guy they said they loved. ? We are desperate to get this guy into a foster where they can start working on his confidence again. Someone who can make him feel like he is worth it. Clifford is ok with other dogs with proper introductions. Clifford would be best in a home with no kids, we prefer no other dogs but rotation savvy fosters will be considered.\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/foster_form/11084/generic",

My ID number is 335183\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Sheba! Sweet girl Sheba is looking for a low-key, mellow home to call her own. Sheba came to the Shelter when her people no longer had time for her, poor girl, doesn't quite understand this or her change in living situation. Sheba walks well on a leash and knows some basic commands. At times, Sheba can be a bit shy, but once she warms, she's excited to meet you. Cuddling and being with her people are things this pretty girl really likes. Like all pets, Sheba deserves to be in loving, safe and secure home!\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption. \n\nSheba did test positive for heart worm disease and is currently in treatment. She is on restricted activity for the duration of her treatment. It is very important to have your pets on heart worm preventative; this simple preventative measure will ensure that you and your pet avoid a very unpleasant and costly experience.\n\n Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Weight: 69lbs Age: 4yrs 2mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

Malcolm may benefit from another playful, social dog in the home to help guide him. Malcolm has shown promise with brief interactions with cats, but has not been formally tested.

I weigh about 44 pounds, I am already spayed, and I just love all people (big and small), other dogs, the UPS delivery man, and probably burglars - that means I'm not much of a watch dog. I even ignore cats, and I hardly ever bark.\n\nI do have a slight case of heartworms, but I am going to start that treatment soon and will be as good as new. But they good news is you can preadopt me and we can bond while I'm going through my treatment - talk to my foster mom.\n\nI was pretty skinny when I came to Angels, but underweight but I now have a trim girlish figure. The vet said I am six years old, but I have plenty of playful energy. And now, I'm working on good house manners. I'm figuring out the whole \"potty outside\" thing.\n\nI like to play with my toys and I give kisses and snuggles. Don't you want to come meet me?\n\nThank you for checking out my bio, please check back for an update. My life was saved recently and we are getting me safe and warm. Information will be updated as soon as I get settled in at my foster home.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

They're so sweet and sticky, and you always want another one?\n\nThat's maybe why I'm named Honey BunBun - I'm all of those things but with a double BunBun. I'm so sweet, love to be with my people (stick right to you), and I always want more. I'm also looking for a home. Who wouldn't love having a Honey BunBun around?\n\nI'm a 6-year-old, 55-pound, female Rottweiler mix who loves to be with people and loves attention - especially belly rubs. I never miss an opportunity for a belly rub. I'm already house-trained, and I'll go into a crate, but I'm still learning and will cry a little bit. I know what a leash is and enjoy walks, but I get excited and pull toward all the great scents.\n\nMy former home had lots of other dogs, and I did well, although my foster hasn't seen me around any yet. I'm pretty good with my foster mom's cat - the cat will let me know she's had enough and swipes my nose.\n\nI do have a case of heart-worms. My former home didn't give me preventatives, but Angels will take care of the heart-worms, and soon, I'll be as good as new. In fact, if you think I'm the girl for you, you can pre-adopt me, take me through my treatment, and then have me for your very own. Ask my foster mom about it.\n\nThank you for checking out my bio, please check back for an update. My life was saved recently and we are getting me safe and warm. Information will be updated as soon as I get settled in at my foster home.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

She's packed and ready to make her way there today! Dollar is a ten-year-old, thirty-pound hound mix who is sweet, gentle, and very affectionate. She's a super cuddle-bug, too! This Little Engine is crate trained and leash trained. She's on a medication that causes her to go potty more often, but the good news is that she's potty trained and will go potty outside or on pee-pee pads.\n\nDespite coming from a hoarding situation, Dollar loves people and other dogs - she will wag her tail to show you how happy she is now! She will also give you kisses and offer her paw to you with affection. Dollar is being treated for those pesky heartworms, but this little caboose will be ready to get her play-on in no time at all!\n\nYou can't find a more loving and adoring companion than Dollar. Her gentle eyes tell you she's ready to love and be loved by the right forever family. She's a docile girl who's ready to leave the station and ride the train straight into your heart today!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

I am great with kids and other dogs and I get more excited about receiving love and affection than anything else, even meal times. That's all I want, LOVE and affection and to give my love and appreciation back. I even try to sit on my mommy's lap because I love her so much! I also could care less about cats! Just a few more facts about me (thought you might want to know) - I have had only had a few accidents in my foster family's house. My foster mommy thinks it was due to a change in diet. I sleep in my crate all night and I just adore car rides! Unfortunately, up until now, my life has not been an easy one. I was food deprived and heavily neglected. My foster family has helped me gain some weight and I just have a few more pounds to go. I do have an eye infection (cherry eye) and I am Heart Worm positive (Stage 1). According to my vet, my eye will be treated once I get through my Heart Worm treatment. I do need to tell you, despite all the bad things that have happened to me, the best thing about being part of the AAU family is they will provide the help and meds needed to get me well. So, please consider adopting me. I am an adorable, friendly and affectionate little girl, who desperately wants a family to love me.

Did I mention that I was also starving?\n\nAge: 1.5 years old. My puppy life was not the best experience for me.\n\nEnergy Level: Depends on your mood. I can be a great adventure buddy or a great Netflix and chill under the covers buddy. I am very agile.\n\nFavorite hobby: I am a certified seat warmer. I can keep a couch or bed warm. (Can you blame a girl for finally feeling comfortable?)\n\nI also love going on car rides and hiking adventures. I am agile and ready to explore the world with you!\n\nOther dogs: I get along well with calm and polite dogs who will also play with me. My foster home has a tiny Chihuahua and 3 medium sized dogs. Slow introduction is needed when meeting any new dogs.\n\nCats: No, thanks.\n\nKiddos: I love them, but older/considerate kids due to my random urges to do zoomies.\n\nSuper Powers: I am a cuddle bug! Oh, and I may or may not have the ability to snore like a full grown man!\n\nGuilty Pleasures: Showing you my tummy for some lovin'. Yep, I got no shame to flip over for ya.\n\nMy resume includes: Being trained at The Houston Dog Ranch by The Texas Dog Father (I was a star student).\n\nSkills: I am crate and potty trained. I know sit, stay, come and will wait for a command to leave the crate or go outside.\n\nIdeal Family: Someone who is patient and structured who will continue my journey to trust the human kind. I need a firm leader that I can trust to protect me. I will need a slow introduction to any new humans or animals I meet. Several meets with me is best and my foster family will assist me in transitioning to my new home and will teach you all about me. I am weary of new people, but once I get attached, I attach. A companion dog is a plus, because it helps me gain confidence and trust.\n\nAn older kid is also a plus, I love to snuggle with them.\n\nI am heartworm negative, spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccines. My adoption fee is $200 and will include spay, vaccinations, and microchip. You can apply at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables\n\nto meet me",

As time passed, he started to embrace new things and people. He is adorable and silly. He loves play time, enjoys walks, and he is beginning to make dog friends.

            "description": "Hi! My name is Cleo. I'm somewhere around 4-5 years old. We aren't really sure because somehow I ended up in the woods out in the country.\n\nA nice farmer saw me eating her trash and she decided to feed me and let me sleep on her porch. I lived on her porch for about a year. It was so nice having a porch to sleep on, but the thing is, I hate thunderstorms. And one night during a really bad one, I got so excited I accidentally scratched up the doorframe. I just really wanted to go inside where I felt safe.\n\nMr. Farmer didn't like that I scratched up the door frame so he told Mrs. Farmer she had to find a new home for me.\n\nA fun family with three little kids came to my rescue. They are the best. I just love going on walks and hikes with them. They have another dog about my size named Ralph, and we have a great time chasing each other and battling for big sticks. The thing is, as much as I love little kids, I just can't seem to get used to them. I like giving them kisses, but their big energy and little hands make me feel uneasy. I would probably be OK with kids 12 yrs and older .\n\nI sure am going to be sad leaving my new family. They have reminded me how wonderful it is to be a house dog again. I am looking for someone who will love me the rest of my years. I'm kind of an older girl who's ready to settle down. Walks are my favorite, but I need someone experienced with big dogs who can continue to leash train me.\n\nI feel most comfortable lounging around the house when you're gone but I love to play outside too!\n\nDo you think you could be my forever owner?\n\nhttps://greatdanefriends.com/cleo\n\nPlease contact Great Dane Friends (info@greatdanefriends.com) for more information about this pet.\n\n*****Great Dane Friends of Ruff Love covers NC and surrounding states for adoptions. We require a fenced yard (exceptions made on a case by case basis - NO exceptions for puppies or deaf/vision impaired dogs - no invisible fencing), that stairs in the home be covered with some sort of slip resistant material to prevent injury, that all other animals in the home be up to date on vaccinations as well as spayed/neutered and that all dogs live inside as a part of the family. Our approval process consists of an application, vet and reference checks, phone interview and house check. Please email us for an application or if you have any questions.*****",

            "description": "Little Sadie came to OHAR in an emergency situation - the people who found her couldn't keep her, Sadie was emaciated and couldn't walk!\n\nOne of OHARs fosters stepped up to give this little girl a soft spot to land while she was being medically evaluated. Fearing the worst, the news came in.. Sadie had a shattered pelvis. Over the next 8 weeks Sadie was an outstanding patient for her foster while on 100% crate rest. She was quiet as a church mouse but squirmed like a wiggle worm while getting belly rubs and all over scratches from her foster mom. \n\nCrate rest is over and Sadie has a clean bill of health on her pelvis. She can move about and play with the other dogs although she is still rebuilding the muscles of her back legs and does get a little wobbly at times. As Sadie's health continues to improve her stability and balance will continue to increase.\n\nSadie is house trained; she has had an occasional overnight bladder leak from her injury. With medication and time this has greatly improved. She is great with other dogs large and small and will play at the drop of a hat. If a human is near she will make a beeline to get her scratches before anything else! We don't know her history but given her state coming in it is no surprise she does a little resource guarding with food and toys. Once she begins to get comfortable with the dogs around her this dissipates to an occasional grumble. Recommend feeding separately for at least the first two weeks.\n\nLast, as if everything else were not enough, Sadie tested heartworm positive. She is on medication in advance of her first treatment in October.",

Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.

Not too long ago, his rescuer found him on the street, unresponsive and covered from head to tail in wounds and infection. His left ear was so infected that it flopped down 90 degrees!\n\nFast forward to today\u2026Uni is enjoying life to the fullest, so don\u2019t let his RBF fool you! His favorite activities are going for walks, getting chin scratches, and meeting new dog friends! Being part husky, he\u2019ll happily let you know just how excited he is, but while you work, he\u2019s just as happy to lay quietly at your feet and nap. He\u2019s still learning to play with toys since he most likely has never seen one, but he\u2019ll engage in dog puzzles (anything for treats)! Uni is house-trained, crate-trained, working on commands, and once fully recovered, will be the perfect running companion. He is heartworm positive, but has begun treatment and will soon beat those pesky worms. \n\nUni\u2019s ideal forever home will have a very secure backyard (as escape artist is in his husky genes) and would have a doggie sibling to play with. However, he has done well as solo dog in his foster\u2019s home. He\u2019s done well with children he\u2019s met on walks. Uni is also potty trained and does just fine in a crate too - just no kitties please.",

My foster mom who is a vet tech was on her way home from work and saw me eating garbage at a railroad track. She tried to get me but I was scared and took off running. She didn\u2019t give up and followed me for 1/2 a mile before finally catching me. I was terrified, hungry and thirsty.  It took me awhile to warm up. People haven\u2019t treated me well so it takes me time to trust. I\u2019m house trained, kennel trained and sweet as can be.  I do well with some dogs and play very gently.  I would do better in a home that has older children and a calm environment. I\u2019m learning to play ball and I walk well on a leash.  I may always be a little nervous of new things so I will require an experienced home. I\u2019m a big love bug. \nWith Love Hogan\n\nBigloverescue.org for an adoption application. Hogan is in a foster home and we must have an approved application of file before we make an appointment for a meeting.",

Now that she is moving in with her father, the father said Woobie can\u2019t live with them.\n\nWoobie has always been such a blessing to our family. She brought us all together & showed us each so much love. Since she was a puppy she\u2019s always carried such a happy personality. Woobie was born on Christmas Eve 2013. We were told she\u2019s an American bulldog. She\u2019s potty trained. She loves food. She loves to play fetch. She\u2019s not too great with other dogs because she\u2019s very territorial but we\u2019ve been living with my moms dog for over a year now & they get along great now. Shes never been around cats. She\u2019s always been amazing with small children & babies!! Very sweet & patient. She\u2019s good in the car. Woobie loves to be walked but she must stay on a leash at all times!! She loves to snuggle & be pet. She\u2019s a very low maintenance dog all she needs is love & treats of course.\n\nShe does not like being kenneled. She is a free roaming house dog. \n\nShe is difficult sometimes to walk cause she wants to pull and go towards other dogs. Since she never played with other dogs growing up her dog skills are lacking and because of her size it would be best to have her own yard and no other pets. Otherwise, it will take time, patience and could be too risky. \n\nWhen no other dogs are around she is great on leash going on walks\n\nApply for Woobie at tmldogrescue.com",

LOVES people of all ages but might be too much for tiny kids or elderly people. Likes other smaller or similar-sized dogs, but does need time to warm up to them. We are working on leashed fear aggression towards large dogs but with my mom's dogs she doesn't have any issues. Leash and crate trained. NEEDS a secure FENCE and/or multiple walks a day, loves to run.  ABSOLUTELY NO CATS or small animals.  \n\nKnows sit, stay, shake, spin, lie down, \"go to bed,\" and waits for her food before being released. \n\nHis breed is pure mutt.  DNA testing showed 15-20% of most everything and nothing predominant! \n\n?Contact Emma at 954-638-8789\nShe is located in Jonesborough, Tn?",

            "description": "Major is a 2-3 year old Shar-Pei mix. He is quite statuesque and beyond handsome. He is a very active boy who plays hard. You must earn his trust when first meeting him. Shar-Peis are known to be very intelligent and loyal. Major would benefit from some obedience training to help him bond with his owner and give him a better sense of who is in charge. He will require a physical fence.\nAHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport is a 501c3 no-kill animal rescue located in De Soto, Iowa. Our pets are located at our facility and in foster homes around Central Iowa. We do adopt to out of town applicants, however we do require new family members be picked up in person. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting one of our adorable adoptables, the first step in our process is to complete an adoption application. To complete an application or read more about our adoption process, please visit our website:\n\nhttps://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/adoption-process/\nOur adoption fees are:\n\n$300 - Puppies (up to 6 months)\n\n$195 - Dogs age 6 months - 7 years\n\n$100 - Senior Dogs (age 8 and up)\n\n$200 - Bonded Buddies\n\n$100 - Kittens (up to age 6 months)\n\n$150 - 2 Kittens\n\n$60 - Cats age 6 months and up\n\n$90 - 2 Cats\n\nFor the most up-to-date listing of adoptable animals, please visit our website: https://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescue animal!",

            "description": "At 45 lbs in weight Neville is a medium sized dog. He is tall and lean. He is 2 years old and is a very sweet boy. Two things are on his list of favorites. Sitting with you to get some loving and playing ball. He loves ball! He is an active dog that will need a family that is match for his energy level. Whether it be hiking or running he would love the challenge. He would probably do best as an only dog. He loves to run the fence with others here at the rescue but really likes his space and has been known to set boundaries with other dogs. He does fine with cats and kids. He will need a 6 ft. Privacy fence.\nAHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport is a 501c3 no-kill animal rescue located in De Soto, Iowa. Our pets are located at our facility and in foster homes around Central Iowa.

            "description": "Cornbread is a handsome senior JRT mix. Fairly new to the rescue from AC. He is a little hesitant but loving. He tested negative for HW's which is a blessing. He's calm and would love a home with no children under the age of 12. He is cut as a button and would add joy to any home.If you wish to meet me, please call the Humane Society of York County at (803)-802-0902 to schedule an appointment. Adoption consultations are by appointment only.\n\nPlease refer to our website for adoption requirements: https://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org/adopt/adoption-process.html\n\nTo learn more about the HSYC, please visit our website at www.humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org, Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/HSYC.animals/, or on Instagram at HumaneSocietyofYorkCounty\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nPhotographs courtesy of Emiko at https://www.studioemikophotography.com/, Christi Menefee at ChristiMenefee.tumblr.com, and Karen Carnahan from River Art Images https://www.facebook.com/riverartimages",

If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n \n\nHi. I move socks.\n\nI love EVerything about living in a house-My food...your food. My bed...your bed. My toys...your toys. \n\nI love people after I get used to them. I love boy dogs even faster. I don't know any girl dogs currently, but did ok with them before. I am very energetic and strong so probably wouldn't be best for tiny humans. I also get too excited and think that nipping is included in playing sometimes, so that's a work in progress.\n\nI look all black in some pictures, but I'm really dark gold with a black racing stripe so I can run fast and play forever, but when I'm done running around I like things to chew on. I am also super silly, a level 72 certified Nap Master and belly rubs are my favorite.\n\nIdeally I'd like a yard and another furry sibling to play with and humans that will continue my training. I'm a good girl, but still have a lot to learn.\n\n \n\nI am spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

            "description": "Lyla is a sweet, affectionate Golden Retriever mix who was born in December of 2018. This sweetie pie is looking for a new home with no children. Lyla does love to play with other small and larger dogs BUT SHE DOES GUARD her food and toys from them so they would have to be tolerant of her sometimes sassy attitude and her owners would have to be watchful of her guarding. Due to this, it is suggested that dogs be separated when owners not at home.\n\nLyla enjoys her toys and doesn't really like to share. A fenced yard is a definite plus because she loves to play outside.\n\nLyla does some resource guarding so she would not fit in a home with children due to this personality trait. Lyla, who already knows some basic commands, is a smart girl who thrives on treats and positive reinforcement. Due to events in her past, she does not like anyone touching her neck and collar. She comes fully house trained and vetted!! Lyla may need a few minutes to warm up to new people, especially men, but she is able to adjust quickly! If you have the time and patience to help Lyla become her best self, fill out an application today!\n\nPlease note: Lyla has guarding issues and will need to be placed in a home with prior dog experience. Adopter also will be required to work with our positive reinforcement trainer so her treatment plan to address her guarding tendencies can continue in the adoptive home. Also no children in the home.\n\nUpdate 1/11/20. Lyla's best friend was adopted and she really misses running and playing with another dog. A playful dog her size or larger would be ideal. Lyla is currently on a diet as she gained a couple pounds over the holiday. She has also gotten much, much better with her resource guarding. And she loves to play fetch!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Lyla is $350, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Lyla into your home, please begin by submitting our Adoption Application. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com. We invite you to visit our Facebook Page, and when you visit, please don't forget to Like our Facebook page so that you wont miss any information about our dogs and events!",

            "description": "Zoie is a spunky 10-year-old Weimaraner/Husky mix, looking for a loving home. She is timid and nervous at first around strangers, especially men. Fast movements are a little scary for her so a quiet, low traffic home with no small children would be best for her. She loves to go on walks where she can take her time sniffing all the wonderful smells along the way or to meander around the yard. And after being outside, a nice snuggle on the couch with a soft blankie is right up her alley! She has lived in an apartment and house and would do well in either setting. She is quiet, potty trained and not destructive when left alone. She has lived with a cat before however she currently does not like to share her space with other dogs. She would really appreciate a calm, patient home that can help her thrive and be the best little old lady that she can be!\n\nPotential adopters will have access to Muddy Paws trainers to help Zoie have the smoothest transition to her new home. Adopters should expect several meetings with Zoie to get her used to them before bringing her home. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Zoie is $250.00. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of\nveterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs\nfoster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be\ndone by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right\napplicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. To learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

There are two other dogs in his foster home, and after a short adjustment period he does very well with both of them.\nObservations with Cats: Untested\nObservations with Kids: Untested\nHouse Training Progress: No recent accidents. \nCrate Training Progress: Colton is mostly quiet in the crate. Sometimes he whines loudly when initially left alone (e.g., foster parent/dogs go upstairs), but he is learning to settle down.\nLocation: DC Area Foster\nRescued From: Columbus County, NC\nAdditional Information: Colton is a darling dog who has lots of fun with his chew toys. This sweet boy is sometimes startled when getting pets, and he is learning the joys of living in a home with loving humans. Colton gets thrown off by loud noises while out on walks, and he would probably not do well in a dense neighborhood. With some more TLC and training, Colton is on his way to becoming a wonderful furever friend!\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

This handsome black and tan pup is 5 years old and the perfect 30 lb size. He had a rough start to his young life but has really blossomed in foster care, and now he\u2019s ready for a family of his own!\n\nHuck arrived at the shelter in severely neglected condition at the beginning of this covid debacle. He was quickly adopted, and returned \u2013 twice \u2013 by families that just weren\u2019t a good fit. Thankfully we had a foster home available by then, and when the shelter reached out to ask for help finding his perfect match next time around, we were happy to say yes. We\u2019ve had a chance to see this sweet boy gain confidence and really come out of his shell. And you know what? The dog beneath that soft wavy fur is a true gem who\u2019s ready to shine his way into your heart.\n\nHuckleberry boy is looking for a quiet adult home with low foot traffic, and hopefully a private yard of his own. Loud noises can startle him and a bustling area is not his style. He\u2019s a chill dude, after all! He enjoys a couple nice walks each day and is content to lay quietly at your feet while you\u2019re working. Crate trained and house broken, our lil diamond is also not a barker. He\u2019s shy around new people at first but warms up with patience and time, and once you\u2019ve earned his trust, he\u2019s a most affectionate chap who enjoys belly rubs and scratches. Huck could live with a well-matched doggie pal but he\u2019d also be fine flying solo with folks who are home a lot. He hasn\u2019t met any cats on our watch but we think he\u2019d probably be ok with a savvy feline too.\n\nWhere\u2019s the lucky family who will adopt our gentle lowrider? If he sounds like the soulmate you\u2019ve been searching for, reach out today and ask about Huckleberry boy!\n\nSouthern California adopters only please!\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/waggingdogrescue/photos_albums\n\nAdoption Application: \nhttps://waggingdog.org/adopt/\n\nWebsite: https://waggingdog.org\nEmail: adoptions@waggingdog.org",

He's just a plain adorable 85lb sweetheart who knows his basic commands. Quiet and respectful, he'll make anyone a perfect huggy companion. Campeon needs an ONLY DOG household. He\u2019s a great companion dog - not so much a dog\u2019s best buddy. We are requesting $250 adoption donation.\n\nHe is currently fostered in Florida. We will set up a video chat with Campeon's foster so you can ask any questions you may have about his behavior and attitude directly. Door to door transport is a separate charge. We will coordinate and set up direct contact with our Transport partner person who provides experienced home delivery service with one-on-one knowledgeable intro to your household.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Campeon, please submit our adopt application on your cell or computer. We will respond immediately. \n\nPlease copy and paste into your browser:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/GFS_nj/ADOPT_FOSTER_Application",

Some dogs require fenced in yards, please feel free to ask any of our volunteers if the animal you're interested in requires a fenced in yard.\n\nPlease call 850-968-3260 for information on any of the animals you see listed with the JHS (Jr. Humane Society)\n\nNigel is 9 month old Catahoula/Aussie mix who needs an attentive, loving home!  He has a fantastic personality and is a very smart boy!  He knows several commands and prays before he eats.  Nigel loves kids (would do best with kids 10+ because he's so playful) and loves other dogs of all ages and sizes! He is good on leash and loves to go on adventures. He is high energy and needs an active owner or another high energy sibling to play with! Nigel is up to date on shots, neutered, heartworm negative, microchipped, and crate and house trained! \nAn approved application (application can be found on our website) is required before a meet and greet. \n\n\nThe Junior Humane Society is a non-profit, all volunteer, animal rescue group. For over 30 years, we have helped animals in the Gulf Coast area. \nAll animals waiting for adoption are placed in foster homes. Before placing the animal in a furever home, JHS provides all necessary vet care, including but not limited to: shots, spaying, and neutering. \nWe hold adoptions event every Saturday at PetSmart in Pensacola, FL from 12-4",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Hank, a beautiful cream and black appx 3 yr old German Shepherd mix.  I'm a very sweet, happy, feisty pup!   I love to run and jump and play with my foster daddy and my best Husky buddy Bandit!  Bandit probably just got adopted, though, so I'm REALLY LONELY without him!!  :(\n\nFrom my foster daddy: Hank is a playful, happy dog!  He tends to jump on me when he first sees me bc he's so happy to see me, but once he calms down, he wants to be my shadow and shows OVERWHELMING LOVE!! :)  He likes to lay down near me, sometimes with his head on my foot!  :)  :)\n\nHe gets along well with people, other dogs and kids (we have a 2 yo granddaughter who he gently tries to get close to). He has a very playful temperament.  He loves to wrestle with his male Husky buddy, Bandit. They play all day long & he has NO aggression towards dogs or other people. \n\nHe's a bit shy at first, but then he falls in love.  He's very good walking on a leash. I walk him on the left side w a choker chain & correct him w slight tugs on the leash. He barks a little in the yard at other dogs / squirrels that go by, but is not bad about it. \n\nI recommend @ least a 6' fence and/or invisible fence and a decent sized yard.  He would jump or run off if the fence is too low or the gate is left open.\n\nHank may need some work on potty training bc he's had to spend a lot of time outside. He's not cat-tested and we haven't tried crate training.\n\nWe feed him Purina One -- Lamb & Rice -- with a dash of DINOVITE supplements, twice/day,  1-1/2 cups/feeding.  *As with ALL DOGS, Hank is best  fed separately from other dogs to avoid any food competition.*\n\nWILL YOU GIVE SWEET HANK A LOVING HOME AND FAMILY TO CHERISH??",

Finally, yesterday we got the call that she had been released and could we get her into Rescue and one of our wonderful volunteers drove to get her and bring her back where she will be checked out by the CTDR vet and then we will be looking for a forever home for her to spend out the rest of her golden years.",

            "description": "Meet this happy girl named Nina! She came into the shelter early November 2020 when her owner could no longer keep her and there was no one else to care for her. She is 1 year old, current on shots, and just a happy girl. She can be shy around people she doesn\u2019t know but once she warms up and knows you you will have a FOREVER friend in her. She loves to run and play fetch with a toy, ball, or stuffed animal. Just a beautiful girl inside and out. Might you have the most amazing loving FOREVER home for sweet Nina?! Stop by the shelter for a visit with her and give her back the awesome life she\u2019s missing! A FOREVER home! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

If you have dogs she would love that. She loves to play. Give her time/tenderness ~she will become your best friend with her tail wagging always ! Her difficulties are food aggression (must be fed separately) , door darting (would need fenced yard) A couple or single person or family w/ older children (we have found, due to not ever being around them, she is uncertain of children's quick moves). }  4-5 yr old, 52 lb, house trained. She was afraid around new people, groups, but has done so well at events.  She is heartworm positive & has had 30 days doxycycline & taking the 6 applications of Advantage Multi-Important NEW information on this treatment kills the worms & dogs are testing negative 3 (smaller dogs) to 6 months. We had \u201cbefore\u201d & \u201cafter\u201d ECHO on a 50 lb dog & worms were dead & safely being absorbed in the body!!  She has NO symptoms of health issues !!!\n***\nThank you for your interest in applying to adopt !

He is initially nervous around new people, but with time he will grow more comfortable in his new home. This boy is gentle with people and playful with other dogs. He has a lot of love to give to someone who will take the time to allow him to warm up to them. Hootie would do best in a house with a fenced yard, since he is nervous on a leash. He would love a playmate to help him to grow his confidence and learn to trust people. He is house trained and crate trained.",

            "description": "Chandler\nDachshund blend, 12 lbs., 2-3 years old \n\nHi, my name is Chandler! I am about 2-3 years old and I weigh about 12 lbs. The humans around me say they think I am a Dachshund/Terrier blend of some sort. I'm not really sure what that means but I understand them when they say how beautiful I am ?.\n\nI really am a good boy and I want to make the humans around me happy, but I'm really SCARED of just about EVERYTHING. I am easily startled over everyday noises that other pooches wouldn't be. Things like setting a glass on the table or putting your fork down on your plate, for instance, put me on edge. The list of things that startle me is endless ?. I will even run outside, through the dog door, sometimes when my humans enter the room, especially if they're wearing boots. This also means that fast movements and excited kiddos are a big NO in my world. I just don\u2019t have the ability to adjust to little people, it\u2019s super scary to be around them. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there have been a few times when I have let my foster people pet me, and I enjoyed it. What I really need is someone super special that is willing to give me all the time in the world that I need to become comfortable. I'm not sure if that means 3 months or maybe even 3 years. Heck, I may never become totally comfortable but I'm sure there is that special someone out there that is looking just for me.\n\nI am potty trained in my current foster home, with a doggie door, so having a doggie door and a secure fenced backyard really is a must for me. I really enjoy the company of the other dogs in my foster home, and I will need a canine companion in my new home to show me the ropes, and help me become more comfortable.\n\nFostered in Eugene/Springfield, Oregon\n\nAdoption fees help cover the costs of Transport, Distemper/Parvo Boosters, Rabies shot, Microchip, and Spay/Neuters, as well the dog comes with a collar, harness and leash. You will also receive a PetSmart puppy packet with 100.00's of dollars of savings, you get a FREE bag of food, 30 min private training session with a certified dog trainer as well as a free checkup at Bandfield. Adoption fee is $350.00.\n\nPlease E-mail wigglytailsdogrescue@yahoo.com if you would like an application. Just because you request an application in no way guarantees you a dog as we receive several applications and will choose the best home for the dog.\n\nMust live within 30 Miles of Eugene!! If you live outside the 30 area still send an email as some time we can make special arrangements. \n\nWiggly Tails Dog Rescue is proud to rescue dogs in urgent need and to also assist local owners who can no longer care for their small breed dog. All our dogs are up to date on their shots and spay or neutered.  We do require a foster or adoption application for those interested and will visit your home for a meet and greet before releasing the dog to you.\n\nYou can check out our other adoptable dogs at: www.wigglytails.org or http://www.facebook.com/WigglyTailsDogRescue. We are located in Eugene, Or and require a home check so interested adopters need to be local.\n",

Copy and paste the link into your browser to view. \n\nNovember 2020: Oliver is a very thin young Pointer that was found as a stray in rural Indiana. No doubt he was dumped and left to fend for himself. He came in about 5-10lbs underweight but doing well now that he is in foster care. He is very sweet, affectionate, great with other dogs and likes to play with tennis balls. His cage training and house training is going well- but he does need some work on his manners- like counter surfing. Oliver is sadly positive for heartworms, but we have a great program that is easier on the dogs without any exercise restrictions. Pointers are the best dogs and for their safety we do require safe fenced in yards. <P> I would like to line up a foster to adopt home for Oliver in the Chicago area that can help with his care.\n\nIf you would like to help, please copy and paste the link into your browser to view:  http://illinoisbirddogrescue.org/foster_app.html and submit a foster to adopt home application.\nYou can also call Lisa@ 630-694-1359\n\n",

All our dogs are up to date on their shots and spay or neutered.  We do require a foster or adoption application for those interested and will visit your home for a meet and greet before releasing the dog to you.\n\nYou can check out our other adoptable dogs at: www.wigglytails.org or http://www.facebook.com/WigglyTailsDogRescue. We are located in Eugene, Or and require a home check so interested adopters need to be local.\n",

She was a much loved family dog until her owner passed away, and right now she's a bit sad and confused. ? When she arrived to Long Island, Queenie went home with her new mom to NYC. Unfortunately, it turns out that Queenie definitely isn't a city girl. The hub bub of NYC just isn't her style. We're looking for a calm and patient home where she can relax, de-stress, and realize she's safe and sound. Queenie is a super easy girl - mild mannered, easygoing, a perfect size for car rides, loves other dogs, very affectionate, and will easily slip into her new forever home. We don't know how she does with cats. Queenie is microchipped, vaccinated, and is being spayed by the rescue prior to adoption. Her adoption fee is $400.",

He is crate trained and sleeps quietly all night in his crate, but will enjoy snuggling in bed with you if allowed. Roscoe has a few quirks and would do best in a quiet home as he tends to get very protective of the people he loves. He does have some resource guarding from other dogs, so needs to be managed with toys and food. Roscoe does take some relationship building, but once he warms up he is your best friend. Would do best with children 12+. He is currently in a foster home in Phoenix, but arrangements can be made to have him available for meet and greets.",

He loves to squeak toys with his big ol dober beak, and he absolutely loves to snuggle that schnoz into the nook of your neck. He is an extremely loving Doberman.\n\nSadly at one point in time, Chester was abused by a man so we'd ideally like to find a female adopter, or a very gentle natured man. He will be your loyal protector, from taking a run, to snuggling on the couch, he'll be your guy. He is a master hunter, so please no small pets or cats. A fenced in backyard would be awesome as well!\n\nFor more information on Chester, or to set up a meet and greet, please call or text Ginny at 954-295-7536 between 7pm and 10pm. You can also fill out an application on our website at www.doberescue.net.\n\n*Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer run organization. Any calls/texts received before or after the designated times will be returned the following day.*",

If you have room in your heart and home to give a hound a second chance, please fill out an ONLINE FOSTER HOME APPLICATION\n\nThis good looking 8 year old gentleman is looking for a family to call his own. While we do not know much about where Malkin spent most of his life, we think he worked hard and spent time with other dogs. He would thrive in a multiple dog home; he likes being outside with the pack. Exercise is key to his happiness, as it helps him settle into the day. Structure is also important to him and he does best with a predictable schedule. He has a great voice and likes to use it, so his new home should be prepared for classic hound song notifications throughout the day. A house on a busy street probably would not be ideal. He would also do best in a home with older adults and no small children. Malkin weighs about 90 pounds and is currently hanging out with his foster mom's pack north of Charlotte.",

Jujube is a playful and energetic pup who loves long walks, runs, and games of fetch. He gets along great with other dogs and is always happy to make new canine friends. But he is wary of strangers directly approaching him, especially in his home and sometimes responds aggressively. He would do best in a home without children and with a patient adopter who can help him build his confidence. Jujube is housebroken, crate trained, and fully grown at 53lbs. Approved adopters or fosters interested in her can email adopt@hbrdogs.com for more info.

Sadly all of the puppies passed away, and his lady friend has since been adopted. Sterling can be very shy at times but once he warms up to you, he loves you with everything he has. He has a very endearing trot, we believe he was hit by a car at one point.\n\nSterling tippy taps with his front paws when he gets excited. We really, really would love to see him in a home again, a nice calm environment either as an only pet or with a female dog. This amazing dober has been through a lot, and now it's finally time for him to get a home of his own. Forever.\n\nFor more information on Sterling, or to set up a meet and greet, please call or text Ginny at 954-295-7536 between 7pm and 10pm. You can also fill out an application on our website at www.doberescue.net.\n\n*Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer run organization. Any calls/texts received before or after the designated times will be returned the following day.*",

If you're interested, please contact Dogs in Harmony Rescue through the following link or email dogsnharmony@gmail.com for more information on adopting Petey. \nPetey currently resides in Tennessee but will make the trip north if there is an approved adopter. The adoption process will go through Dogs in Harmony, not MPBR. We just want to help find Petey his home:\n\nhttps://adoptapet.com/pet/28935876-Winchester-TN?fromShelter=1&fbclid=IwAR0AHnlBivAYU_k0nMtvM-3vhNP-ZOcw-Qb4OcHT9b8_FtIDUB80IYlSODo\n\n********************************************************************************************************\nMeet Petey. This handsome boy is looking for his furever home! Petey is 1yr 6 moths old and currently living in a foster home in Tennessee through Dogs in Harmony rescue. Petey does not get along well with cats, rabbits or chickens. He is fine around female dogs but a little skiddish around other male dogs. Petey was used as bait in a dog fighting ring, as to why he is skiddish around other male dogs. He is neutered and up to date on all his shots. Petey did live in a home with a 3yr old and a 15yr old child so kids he is good with. His first owners had to give him up due to a change in jobs and hours. Petey is fairly high energy but he does calm down. He also needs a place to run with plenty of exercise.\n\n",

She is a VERY lovely girl who gets along great with other dogs and cats. Unfortunately she has a condition called \"Diaphragmatic Hernia\". When she took an x-ray 1 year ago, vet said the amount of tissue wasn't sufficient enough to close the hernia surgically. However, her condition improved alot over the last year just by limiting amount of food and exercise. We are looking for someone who can get a 2nd opinion from a vet in the States and give her the best care possible.\nShe is currently staying in Korea.\nIf interested please submit an application for us to review.\nWww.nmser.org\nAdoption fee $650",

He came to us from an overcrowded Northeast Florida shelter, so he's a true rescue dog. He has a handsome white coat with black markings and a truly winning smile. He's active and playful, and ready for his puppy training. He should be medium-sized when fully grown. He needs to be the only pet in the home so he'll have you all to himself. He's already neutered, microchipped and up to date on his shots, and ready to start loving you today. Please come meet sweet, smiling Finley!",

She brought me and my 8 puppies to the Big Dog Ranch to get some love and care. I am very sweet but I need to get to know you before I'm willing to let you play with my babies. I love to have all of your attention and get as much love from you as possible. While I haven't been tested with other dogs or cats, it seems that I may be able to live in a home with other animals, if they're the right ones! It would probably be best for me to find a home with an experienced dog owner who can help me learn how to be a more homebody, since I spent so much of my life living outside. I think I could be very happy living in a variety of different environments, from apartments to a big house with lots of land, as long as I have a new family that gives me all of their love. I think that I would like to be the type of dog that joins you as you go out and about and I appear to be potty trained already! I would benefit from some continued training so that I can be the absolute best pup that I can be. I love to go for long walks on the leash, I think I could be an excellent running buddy, but my absolute favorite thing to do would be to lay around and snuggle on the couch with you!",

She is protective of her food. She is also crate trained.\n\nFawn does have a heart murmur, but acts and plays like a puppy.

Caesar truly puts the \"friend\" into \"man's best friend.\" He has not met a single person or dog that he doesn't like, although he likes men in particular. This gentle giant is approximately 8 years old and 70 lbs. He is currently being fostered in Clermont, FL (Lake County). Caesar wants nothing more than to sit at his human's feet or maybe with his head in your lap. Caesar knows what a leash is and gets excited for the occasional walk. He also enjoys gnawing on his bone and chasing a squeaky ball (once he has determined the ball isn't actually a bone). Caesar is well mannered and knows how to sit, lie down and come. Although he has a little arthritis, he can still bounce on two legs with excitement when it's time to eat! Caesar is house trained, crate trained, and up to date on all vaccines. He does require a home with a fenced in yard.",

She is very enthusiastic about life, loves to play and play bite, and would do best in a home with adults only. Pancake does and has lived with dogs here at the Sanctuary and has decent dog skills. She does guard resources from dogs and humans, so some level of management would have to occur in the home. \n\nPancake enjoys walks with her run mate Ron Swanson. She loves to go on car rides, to Tara's Run, and the dog park as well.\n\nPancake did pass her first cat test! So she may be able to live with feline friends. \n\nPancake does require relationship building before she is able to go home. This process does take two to three weeks. A Sanctuary visit is required. Once you are her friend, you are a friend for life! She is so much fun and always down for adventure.\n\nIf you are willing to put in the time for this fiery girl, reach out to our adoption team and fill out an application today!",

Halpert is a clever boy, he knows how to open doors and is constantly solving problems. He takes time to trust new people so would require a few days spent working with him before he shows his softer side and would benefit from an adult only home. Ask about Halpert today!",

Cookies are the way to his heart and he is not picky! Lounging on the couch or going for hikes...Cedric can do it all. He takes a little bit of time to get to know and trust new people. He would require some time before accepting a new person into his circle but he is the silliest boy once you break open that barrier. He can be shy at first with new people but the wait is so worth it. He's a perfect medium size, not too big and not too small. Cedric would do best in an adult only home.

I am 9 months old, neutered, 70lbs and very loved.  I am house trained and kennel trained but I  probably wouldn\u2019t leave me in the house unattended just yet - I\u2019m still learning to be trustworthy. .  I am calm and chill by nature but have the occasional spurt of puppy energy and need to zoom around a yard for a bit.  I am wonderful with kids.  I love long walks with my people, romping outside or lying at your feet after a long day.  I am well behaved naturally but like most dogs could probably use a little formal training.  I love to give kisses and give them unabashedly if allowed. I know, I sound pretty perfect and I am, so why do I need another family to love me?  Unfortunately, I no longer get along with the other 2 dogs in the house.  This doesn\u2019t make me a bad dog, just a dog that needs to be the one and only.  I can walk by dogs on leash and behave in public.   I just don\u2019t like to share my space anymore. I would be the most wonderful and devoted companion and friend to another family but I really need to be the only pet in the house.  What can I say - I need all of the attention and will give you all of mine. \n\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs.  We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.  \n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable.  This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com \n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption.  Our fee is $175.\n",

            "description": "Spicy! This is how one of our volunteers described Chico, and we couldn't agree more. He IS spicy, and we love that about him! Chico is also very affectionate and gives the sweetest little kisses. He really is that perfect combo of sweet and spicy! Chico is a smart pup - he knows sit, down, and shake. Chico picks up on new things quickly, and he is so eager to please his person. Chico is one of those pups who loves everyone he meets, and it's simply impossible not to love him back! Chico has been in foster for several months and we have learned so much about him. Chico will nap most of the day, but he will occasionally check in with you to make sure you haven't forgotten him! Chico gets that burst of energy in the evenings that we call the witching hour - it's important that you exercise his brain as much as his body during this time. Puzzle toys, kongs, marrow bones... make sure you are stocked up! When it's time for bed, scooch over and make room for Chico! He loves to sleep in bed with his person but he is very polite and will not invade your space. He's happy to let you sleep in but then he needs some yard time or a long walk in the morning to get his day started on the right foot. Chico is house trained and is making great progress on his crate training. He doesn't love his crate but he will go in for the right treat. Chico will sleep in it on his own during the day... he loves to curl up in the soft blankets! An ideal home for Chico would be one where he gets to go on a few walks/runs each day, or one that has a yard for him to run around in (or both!). Chico is quite dog reactive so he would need to be the only pet. He also needs an adult-only home. If you have experience with cattle dogs, and know about their needs and behaviors, you could be a great fit for Chico! We won't sugarcoat it... Chico can be a lot of dog. But we know his perfect family is out there, and he is so deserving of a forever home! Chico will go home with a crate, goody bag, harness, free training voucher, and the ongoing support of his volunteer advocates, the Orange Dot Crew. Please email his foster for more information: dloignon@gmail.com",

Sam is a very smart boy and would love a home that can give him plenty of mental and physical exercise each day. He thrives on routines and is very easy to train, because he loves to snack. Sam is only about 3 years old and weighs about 70 pounds. He would do best in a home with only adults and would like to be the only pet in the house so that he can get all of the love to himself. Sam also does have allergies and is on special medication for this. He would need a family that would be willing to help him with his allergies and management.\nIf you think that Sam is the right dog for your home, please fill out an application.\nThinkingoutsidethecage.org/Application",

This sweetheart is around 8 years old, missing one eye and severely vision impaired in the remaining eye. That doesn't seem to have slowed him down. He takes walkabouts around the house and is learning the lay of the land. In just 2 days he knows where the water bowl, food bowl and back door are. He is learning his way back to his crate when it is time for a rest from his adventures. He does very well in his crate and sleeps in it through the night. He gets excited when he hears dinner being prepared and gives a few barks to let you know he knows something good is coming his way. He seems to be house broken. He gets along well with my other dog and is not bothered by the cat. He spent the day with the grand daughters loving on him and he is great on a leash!! He seems to have some hearing loss, although he can hear the dinner bell!! Unfortunately, Boomer came to us with every worm imaginable - tapeworms, hookworms and of course heartworms so he will be with us for a while until his treatments are completed. Put your application in for this sweet boy, he is worth the wait.\n",

Buck is looking for a peaceful environment where he can relax.\n\nBuckshot is a small guy at 12 pounds & we believe that he is 8 years old.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Phoenix\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 1.5 -2 years\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 52 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?:\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/17/20: HELLO!! Its Phoenix from Sanford. I've come a LONG way the month and a couple days since I been in my foster home. My BIGGEST issue was my weight. I started my life with my foster family at 29 pounds. Foster Daddy has been feeding me every chance he gets. The first week I was eating 4 times a day and eating snacks 3 times a day. The second week up until my neuter (yesterday) I have been eating 3 times a day and snacks 2-3 times a day. He is trying to get me to a solid 60 pounds and I don't have far to go. My foster house is great, I have 3 sisters. Izzy and Lucy are bigger than me and my older sister Bella is way smaller than me. They loved me from the first time I came into their home. They wash my face, and sleep close to me to keep me warm. My first 2 weeks I wore this awesome sweater all day to keep me warm. They were gentle with me when I was weak and tiny, now that I have become a big boy they run and play with me in the backyard. Foster Daddy says I'm such a smart boy, I'm silly at times especially when my belly is full of warm nummy's. I love to snuggle at bed time with my sisters or my Daddy. I do great in the kennel during the day while everyone is at work. Daddy sometime lets me stay out with my sisters when he is not gone for a long time, NO ACCIDENTS FOR ME!!!! Today Daddy took me to work and I got all kinds of belly rubs and back scratches. Naomi (16) took me for a walk at work and I was AWESOME. She was not afraid of me, and I was not afraid of her. I will say Naomi did have a pocket FULL of treats. I have some boys that come over to see me and Daddy, they are 3, 10 and 12. I love them, I wish they lived with me cause I'd sleep with them. I've been on field trips to the hardware store, the feed store and the pet store. Its nice to get out of the back yard and do fun things with Daddy. Daddy says I was very smart in all the stores and I always get kisses on my head for being a good boy. I love warm food that fills my belly also frozen uncooked beef bones are the best. Daddy says I will a great dog for any family soon. Daddy is working with me on the leash and my smart boy commands. I'm almost there!\n\n11/15/20: Hi!! I'm PHOENIX, that's my new name. I'm new to CBR by way of Virginia. Dad gave me a new name, said my old name was not strong enough. One day I'll be that strong but right now I don't feel good and like my dad said \"I seen more meat on a cheese sandwich\". Dad picked me up on Veterans Day and I was not doing well so we had to stop at the Vet before I could go home. I do love to eat, dad feeds me 3 times a day!!!. I'll be BIG and STRONG soon, daddy says I already have the handsome part down (WINK). I have 3 sisters and they wash my face, boo boo's and snuggle with me to keep me warm at night. My new life is awesome. Anyway, watch me grow. Daddy says I'll rise from the old ashes of Cody and transform to a PHOENIX. Check me out later.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Carolina Boxer Rescue is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Phoenix\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 1.5 -2 years\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 52 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?:\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/17/20: HELLO!! Its Phoenix from Sanford. I've come a LONG way the month and a couple days since I been in my foster home. My BIGGEST issue was my weight. I started my life with my foster family at 29 pounds. Foster Daddy has been feeding me every chance he gets. The first week I was eating 4 times a day and eating snacks 3 times a day. The second week up until my neuter (yesterday) I have been eating 3 times a day and snacks 2-3 times a day. He is trying to get me to a solid 60 pounds and I don't have far to go. My foster house is great, I have 3 sisters. Izzy and Lucy are bigger than me and my older sister Bella is way smaller than me. They loved me from the first time I came into their home. They wash my face, and sleep close to me to keep me warm. My first 2 weeks I wore this awesome sweater all day to keep me warm. They were gentle with me when I was weak and tiny, now that I have become a big boy they run and play with me in the backyard. Foster Daddy says I'm such a smart boy, I'm silly at times especially when my belly is full of warm nummy's. I love to snuggle at bed time with my sisters or my Daddy. I do great in the kennel during the day while everyone is at work. Daddy sometime lets me stay out with my sisters when he is not gone for a long time, NO ACCIDENTS FOR ME!!!! Today Daddy took me to work and I got all kinds of belly rubs and back scratches. Naomi (16) took me for a walk at work and I was AWESOME. She was not afraid of me, and I was not afraid of her. I will say Naomi did have a pocket FULL of treats. I have some boys that come over to see me and Daddy, they are 3, 10 and 12. I love them, I wish they lived with me cause I'd sleep with them. I've been on field trips to the hardware store, the feed store and the pet store. Its nice to get out of the back yard and do fun things with Daddy. Daddy says I was very smart in all the stores and I always get kisses on my head for being a good boy. I love warm food that fills my belly also frozen uncooked beef bones are the best. Daddy says I will a great dog for any family soon. Daddy is working with me on the leash and my smart boy commands. I'm almost there!\n\n11/15/20: Hi!! I'm PHOENIX, that's my new name. I'm new to CBR by way of Virginia. Dad gave me a new name, said my old name was not strong enough. One day I'll be that strong but right now I don't feel good and like my dad said \"I seen more meat on a cheese sandwich\". Dad picked me up on Veterans Day and I was not doing well so we had to stop at the Vet before I could go home. I do love to eat, dad feeds me 3 times a day!!!. I'll be BIG and STRONG soon, daddy says I already have the handsome part down (WINK). I have 3 sisters and they wash my face, boo boo's and snuggle with me to keep me warm at night. My new life is awesome. Anyway, watch me grow. Daddy says I'll rise from the old ashes of Cody and transform to a PHOENIX. Check me out later.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

So special in fact, that they took me in, paid for my surgeries and then sent me off to a trainer for some basic skills. What a catch I am.\nMy name is Crash - I was hit by a car and taken to Eastex Veterinary in Humble, Tx. I had 2 broken legs. It was painful, and I needed to be crated for a long time to heal. But, I am better now and ready for my forever home.\nI am great with people, and kids, although I am a bit clumsy, I would prefer kids that are a bit older and won't be knocked down by my wiggle butt. I am a great big lover and will give you lots of kisses and love. My foster mom did a DNA test on me and the results were surprising.\n62.5% American Staffordshire Terrier12.5% German Shepherd Dog\n12.5% Chow Chow\n12.5% Guard/Sporting/Terrier.\nThis includes a Great Dane which would account for my height.\nI am a puppy and will need to have a loving patient family who is dedicated to my future, which means I may need professional training.\nI would love to meet you to see if we are a good fit. =========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

            "description": "Finn was turned into the city kill shelter as an owner surrender because his family had no time for him. The shelter sent out a plea for help for him to get out because he was very scared in the shelter and was not showing well for potential adopters. He was added to the daily euthanasia list. He didn't deserve to die because he was scared. We went and picked him up from the shelter and took him into rescue. He has done much better in his foster home. He is housetrained and crate trained and we have been working with him on leash training. He is absolutely gorgeous.  We did a DNA test on Finn.  His results are as follows:  41.6% Doberman Pinscher, 22.9% German Shepherd Dog, 15.6% Siberian Husky, 5.4% Chow Chow, and 14.5% blend of Berger Picard, Dutch Shepherd and Belgian Malinois.  He weighs 48 pounds and is about 1.5 years old. He loves to run and loves to play with other dogs. He is friendly with people. No cats for Finn, he likes to chase them. An apartment setting is not going to be an appropriate situation for Finn's energy level and size.\n\nFinn's adoption fee is $350. Finn has been fully vaccinated, neutered and microchipped so he is ready to go! Finn is currently located in his foster home in Sheridan, TX and will remain there until adopted.",

Heartworm is NOT contagious. The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n\nDo you love getting puppy kisses? Giving belly rubs? Seeing happy tippy tap dances? Then Sierra might just be the dog for you! Sierra is a goofball and is as sweet and happy as they come. She loves her people and I would swear she tries to make you laugh (her go-to is wiggling around on her back and trying to spin in a circle from that position). Shes doing great on a leash, and is perfectly house trained. She gets along well with our little dogs (aside from the occasional paw to the face); no exposure to cats or children so not sure on that. Sierra will take time to warm up to younew things make her nervous, but were working on it! If you have the patience to help her gain confidence and get used to her new surroundings, youll be rewarded with one of the most loving dogs you could ever ask for!",

She is a young husky mix waiting for her forever family. She has very unique eyes. One blue and one blue and brown. Ursula is very quiet and sweet. The only noise she will make is barking when playing. She's not a fan of butt scratches, which is a surprise. If you scratch her neck around the collar, she's in heaven and will paw at you if you stop. Of course, a slow introduction to other dogs is always recommended! She would do best in a home with another dog, after a slow introduction. She can be in a house with older kids. Ursula is spayed, up to date on shots, microchipped, and fully ready to love on her new family!!!",

            "description": "Want a playful, goofy, energetic dog to help distract you from the chaos that is 2020? Then maybe Lego is the dog for you! This 2 year old boy is about 60 lbs and very athletic. Lego is currently in a foster home and his foster family says he has very good house manners! He knows sit, down, stay, and to come when called in the house. He sleeps in a dog bed at night peacefully and every once in a while he'll try to sneak some snacks off the counter. At this time, we think Lego will do best as the only pet in his home but we'll update if that changes.\n\nInterested in adopting? Call us at (916) 687-3042 and Press 3 to leave a voicemail in our Adoption Inbox. Please leave your name, phone number, and the Animal ID Number A024714. 2/2/21 12:49 PM",

            "description": "Barks and Meows Rescue introduces Bear. He is almost 3 years old and is a Husky/Shepherd mix. He weighs 65lbs. He has a medium hair coat. Bear was surrendered to our Rescue after his family fell on difficult times and he and the other unneutered males in the home were not getting along. Multiple dogs in an apartment didn't work for this guy. He has done very well in his foster home where he has a resident female alpha dog to play with every day. He really has enjoyed being with the 4 kids in the home ages 12-16. He is crate trained but only goes in it if he wants to as he is housebroken, Bear was raised with cats and would sometimes chase them. He still pulls a bit on his walk if he sees a squirrel, and is a very strong solid boy. He has come out of his shell since bringing Mili the other foster dog into the home. He was too bossy with the first female dog that was fostered with him so we brought in Mili who quickly showed him who the Queen was going to be. He is allowed on the furniture and basically sleeps where he wants, on the furniture, on the dog bed, in his crate, or sometimes on the floor in his foster parent's room. Bear is a wonderful family dog. He would be fine with or without another canine in the home. If there is another dog, it will need to be a female and one who is the alpha. He loves to give kisses and cuddles. He will bark if someone comes to the door, typical of his breed mix. He rides well in the vehicle. He has been great with children ages 6 and over as per his previous owners. He is a wonderful family dog. Currently, Bear is crated, when his foster family is all out of the house. The ideal home for our Bear is one where someone in the home is home. He is used to having someone around him all the time. Another well socialized, a female alpha dog would work as well. Since he is on the timid side, we would recommend more of a quiet home and one not based in the heart of the city. Since he is known to chase cats, a cat-free home is best. Bear is now neutered, up to date with vaccines, 4DX tested negative, and is on heartworm prevention/flea/tick prevention until December. A fully fenced yard and a Veterinarian History of Compliance are mandatory to apply for Bear.\nVisit barksandmeows.ca for an online application. Available to Ontario Residents only!!!",

He was owner surrendered in October 2020 and arrived at the rescue. \n\nHere is Oliver's story - He was tied to tree outside for his life. He had interaction with some other dogs on the property where he lived but he wasn't socialized with people. \n\nWhen he first arrived at the rescue he would growl and snap at us - all because he was so scared. But, with repeatedly trying to coax him over and slowly petting him, he has come out of his shell with all of the volunteers. \n\nNow, with new people we assume he will act the same way he did when he arrived at the rescue, so Oliver will be adoptable only to people in Arkansas/Missouri and they would need to come to the rescue several times to meet Oliver and let him get to you you. \n\nOne suggestion would be a family with no children, a quiet surrounding, and possibly a farm or big yard for him to run around in. \n\nHe has recently started playing with toys - we don't think he ever had any before. \n\nEmail us at gailspets@hotmail.com for more information on Oliver, or call Gail directly.",

He is smart, gentle, affectionate, loves everyone, and constantly wags his tail.  As you can see from his photos, he has a beautiful, shiny coat. He gets along well with the other greyhounds in his foster home, and is enjoying his new world as a pet.  He is not demanding, walks easily by your side while on leash, stands quietly for a bath and to trim his nails, is quiet and easy going in the house, and is just a really nice fellow.  Dream is also a smaller greyhound at just 67lbs.  He will come to you fully vetted (neutered, teeth cleaned, vaccines updated, and macro chipped.) He is not good with cats.\n\nDespite his small size, Dream was a really good racer. He competed in 59 races and won 8 times. He also had 132nd places.  He was even a Grade A racer, and stakes contender, which means he was among the fastest dogs on the track.  He is a son of the famous Australian greyhound, Defrim Bale, and his lineage includes Djays Octane, Flying Penske, and Oswald Cobblepot.  Dream is a really nice dog with a great pedigree as well as a great personality! He will make a super companion for the family lucky enough to adopt him.\n\nDream has just graduated from  the Greyhound Advancement Center's greyhound training program.  He knows the following commands:  sit, lie down, go to place (his bed or mat), wait at the door, heel, stay, come on recall, and leave it.  He will be ready with his new owner to test for the Canine Good Citizen award, or to become a certified therapy dog.  The inmate trainers really enjoy having the greyhounds at Hardee, and the dogs love all the treats and attention they get.  The inmate trainers are able to earn state sponsored certifications, which they can use to gain employment when they are released.  It is a really nice way for the dogs to become socialized and learn their basic commands, as well as giving the inmates something positive to do while they are incarcerated.  \n\nDream's $600 adoption fee includes his neuter, teeth cleaning, vaccines, Bordetella (to protect against kennel cough), microchip, leash and collar, adoption guide, BAGA identification tag, and prison training. Your adoption fee helps us to defray some of the veterinary and care costs we have incurred for Dream, and will help us to continue our work on behalf of the greyhounds.   For more information or to meet Dream, please contact us at BAGA@tampabay.rr.com. For more information on greyhounds as pets, or to submit an application to adopt  this greyhound, please go to our website: www.bayareagreyhounds.org.   Dream is being fostered in the Tampa Bay area.",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Murphy\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 1 year\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 52 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: None\n\nCrate trained?: Working on it\n\nHouse trained?: Working on it\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/9/20: Hello! Murphy here. So I have made a lot of progress with potty training since the last update! I can ring a bell to go out when I need to. I love water so my foster parents take it up before bedtime so I don't need to go in the middle of the night. I am settling in nicely, and am doing great on walks around the neighborhood. I am still wary of most people, but warm up quickly. I recently went to the vet for 'boy surgery' and I do NOT like my collar, but I am healing nicely. I still love to cuddle in the bed at night, which is hard right now with this cone on! But everything should be back to normal soon. I am learning to play with my toys outside when my foster sisters aren't up for playing. I love running around in the backyard with toys in my mouth! I am also finding my voice, and like to bark only when playing. When folks come to the door, I don't make noise, I just sit on the couch and let my foster sisters investigate! I can't wait to meet my furever family!\n\n11/17/20: My name is Murphy and I am 1 year old! I have a great personality and a wild spirit! I have so much fun with my foster sisters. They are opening up to me as I am with them after only a week! I have learned several tricks while being fostered and am always ready to learn more! I am poised to play at a moments notice and love to cuddle too! I am learning to stay in the yard as well as fetch, but you better be willing to play! I love meal time, and I am learning that I shouldn't get too close to my sisters when they are eating, but I am not food aggressive. I am still potty training, but am learning to ring a bell when I need to go out! My foster family lets me sleep in the bed so I am definitely loving that. I like being near my humans, and love to play! I would make a great little brother to a family with a younger dog, or children. I still act like I am a puppy and have an endless amount of energy!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Ever wanted a German Shepherd but thought they're too big for you? You need to meet Annalyse.\n\nAnnalyse is a little over 1 -year-old, female shepherd mix who weighs around 40-pounds - significantly smaller than most shepherds. She is also already house, leash, and crate/pen-trained and will go to her room/pen when you ask.\n\nUnlike a lot of dogs, Annalyse is pretty self-sufficient and not at all needy. She doesn't require a lot of attention. She enjoys running, playing, and doing zoomies (high energy running around a fenced yard).\n\nAnnalyse is excellent when walking on-leash, but she is a little skittish - so her foster recommends double-leashing. Annalyse loves other dogs and will greatly benefit from having a companion dog and a fenced yard where she can be outdoors doing her zoomies. We aren't yet sure about cats.\n\nWith her intelligence, Annalyse is very attuned to learning - a few treats and positive reinforcement go a long way. Annalyse is best in a quiet home with an adopter who will give her space to adjust on her terms. She is truly a beautiful dog, and she will make someone a great companion.\n\nComplete an adoption application and come to meet her. Her foster mom will be happy to tell you all about Annalyse.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

He is also crate trained and does great with children. We believe he would do best in a home where he can be the only dog or maybe one other female dog. He tends to guard his food, so we suggest feeding separately. He was born in 2017.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

She loves other dogs but hasn't been exposed to cats.  We are looking for a foster or foster to adopt home in Toronto, preferably with a fenced yard, for her to come to when she arrives at the end of November.

I will need an experienced owner or an owner who is willing to take me to professional training so we can learn together. I would do best with larger kids as I am also a large gal. I would love to go home with a dog that can show me that the world is not so scary. I have not been tested with cats. I am looking for an active home that can exercise me daily.

Like many pups, loud noises like thunderstorms and fireworks scare her and she needs plenty of exercise and stimulation to keep her from getting bored. Suki has lived with children and her previous owners shared that she is friendly and obedient. She won't be able to live with small dogs and she will need to meet any dogs in the house before she can go home, but she will be a joyful addition to any home!

Loves people, dogs, cats, you name it. She is very loving and affectionate, she insists on cuddles. She requires a loving home that is at least somewhat savvy with beagles and doxies because they will no doubt follow their noses.  Therefore, a fenced yard  with supervised yard time is ideal, or a very active walking schedule. She loves to play and really enjoys the company of other animal in the household.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Goldie, you could submit an application online to our website www.Valhallarescue.org\n\nGoldie's adoption fee is $500 and helps to ensure that all our animals are vaccinated, microchipped and altered. Due to the pandemic, we currently have her on a Foster to adopt contract until we can arrange to get her spayed. Please contact the rescue for one information and to discuss our policy and adoption options for Goldie.\n\n Thank you for looking at Goldie and have a nice day",

He had a very tough upbringing and still has trust issues because of his early years. Since being in rescue, Brownie has made considerable strides. Brownie is very much a person-dog and wants to be with his person as much as possible. He will shadow his person around the house: supervise cooking, chores, and naps. Brownie takes a while to warm up for petting but does seek close contact (lap sitting) almost immediately. He is trying very hard to be a good boy and when he slips up and reacts to a scary situation with aggression, he quickly realizes his overreaction and tries to make amends.\nBrownie travels in a crate quite nicely even though cars are concerning and he cries at first. He recently got rave reviews at his vet. Brownie plays fetch with squeaky toys, loves going on walks, exploring fenced in yard, and mostly laying on or near his person. If necessary, he will use a pee pad indoors but if kept on a schedule, it shouldn't be needed. Brownie sleeps a solid 9 hours uncrated at night without incident.\nBrownie has been through more than any little guy should have to go through and is looking for a quiet home to spend his senior years.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page. Thank you for your interest in saving a life!",

She has has problem walking with pain on her right rear knee.\nSurgery to correct knee problem on 11/3/2020.\n\nNow, Shiloh goes for physical therapy (PT) at the vet in Santa Clarita, Los Angeles, once per week for 5 weeks. She goes to water therapy in Bakersfield, Kern County, CA,  once per week as long as she needs it  in addition to PT. A hectic schedule for both her and her committed foster!\n\n\nShiloh is a trooper tolerating the tough therapies. Everyone loves her wherever she goes (vet office, Fur and Feathers water therapy place, etc...).\n\nShe has been on antibiotics for her nasal infection and will get spayed after the infection is gone.\nShe cannot receive any vaccination till her nasal infection is cleared by the vet.\n\nTook one horrible person to put her through a dog ring as a bait dog. It takes a whole village to help Shiloh on the road of recovering, experiencing love, compassion, safe, no hungry, no frighten.\n\nWe are taking pre-adoption application. Till she is clear of her infection, spayed, she stays with her foster for both physical therapy, water therapy.",

I was adopted when I was a puppy but through no fault of my own I find myself in need of a new home as my dad lost his job of many years and they need to move out of the area to an apartment.\n\nI am showing signs of age, arthritis and going deaf, but I'm also sweet, enjoy treats and being rubbed. I am known to dart out if I find an opening in the fence. I also have a tendency to dig. It's unknown how I'd do with other dogs, but no cats for me please. I did live with a \"brother\", but he sadly recently passed away. So if you have a fur baby in the home already, please bring him/her along so we can meet. I'm good with children, but I'd do best in an adult only home.\n\nI know most will pass me by as being too old, but if you have room in your heart and home for me, please fill out an application to meet me. I'd really love to spend my golden years in a warm cozy home being loved for the rest of my days. I know my special someone is out there looking for me.\n\nAdditional information: *Current on shots",

I came to SDS with my friend Dakota, after our owner was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and couldn't care for us any longer. We've lived together a long time and enjoy each other's company, but the truth is we're just roommates. I'm unsure of my new surroundings and tend to pace around a lot. When I'm pacing I occasionally stumble but it's hard to get around with this long body and short tiny legs. I would really benefit from another calm doggie sibling to show me around - kinda like a game of Marco Polo! I would do well in a home with older children or adults only, another calm canine friend, and I am indifferent to cats. I would love someone who is home more than not - a guy gets lonely and confused!\n\nIf interested in learning more about me or if you're ready to come meet me, please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com.",

Julia is dog selective, She has lived with a dog in the past but it has been quite some time. We are currently recommending she be an only dog. No cats or small animals. Julia has prey drive as is common in most terrier breeds. We have never met a toy that Julia couldn\u2019t destroy so we do not give her toys for fear she will eat them. Julia is loving. When she is happy there is not a piece of her that doesn\u2019t wiggle. She eats dry food and loves bulky sticks. Julia wants a loving adult companion to shower her with affection. In return you will get her undying loyalty and love.",

He is very loving and playful. He gets along well with my dogs but may not do well with smaller dogs because he has a pretty healthy prey drive. He has been known to dispose of opossum, raccoons and squirrels.\n\nHunter can get nippy/snappy if he is in a house with a lot of drama. I am fairly certain he has some healer or cattle dog in him somewhere. He is very loyal and loves his human. He needs an owner that leads in a firm and fair fashion.\n\nWhile he appears to be a wire hair terrier of some sort his hair is very soft, almost powdery. He tends to stay clean even with puddles around and loves his toys. Balls, tug toys, bones, are all favorites. He should have a crate because it helps keep him grounded and he is an easy keeper, taking treats nice and loves to sleep on the couch, dog bed, in his crate or at the foot of my bed. He does not appear to chew up furniture but I would not recommend giving him stuffed toys so that stays the case.\n\nAdoption fee is $250. All Paws and Prayers animals are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, up to date on flea/tick/heartworm prevention and microchipped. Non-obligatory adoption applications (available here - https://pawsandprayers.org/adopt/adoption-process-and-application/ ) are required to be submitted prior to scheduling a meeting and greet.",

            "description": "Say hi to Nikki! This gorgeous gal came to us from Louisiana after being displaced during the recent hurricane. She is 6 years young and weighs 48 pounds. Nikki loves to play fetch, run zoomies, look out the window, and snuggle with her human friends. While she loves all people, Nikki is not a fan of other dogs and would do best in a home without other animals.  Currently in foster care, she is good with her human foster sisters, ages 6 and 8, likes running along the fence with her foster's neighbor dogs and learning how to sit/ lay down.  She\u2019s certainly a fast learner as she\u2019s sitting on command now.  Nikki has not had any issues being left home alone but LOVES a good car ride when she\u2019s invited to tag along.  Completely house and potty trained, Nikki has done great in a home environment (crates are not her cup of tea) and is content to lie on the couch and watch a good movie or snuggle.  She also walks well using a harness with no leash pulling, loves to roll on her back, and has become the biggest lap dog (just ask her foster dad)!  While she loves her food, she is a gentle eater and acts like such a lady at meal times!  Nikki would be a great addition to a family or someone looking for a loyal companion and doesn't mind a sweet little lady hanging out with them all the time!  If you're looking for a sweet, goofy and cuddly canine buddy, who loves to play with tennis balls, Nikki is it!\n\n",

Don\u2019t let her size and bark scare you; she is a very loving and cuddly, 92 pound girl. That is why we are giving her this name! Precious loves, loves, loves toys! She knows how to sit on command, and loves all the attention she gets! She would love a yard to frolic in as much as she wants, all the toys she could ask for, and a family that loves her as much as she will love them! Meet this 6 year old sweetheart in run 873. Her ID number is 625886. Precious is up-to-date on vaccines, and she will be spayed and microchipped upon adoption. Precious can't wait to meet her new family!  Sadly she has tested positive for heartworms, but with treatment, she should be good as new in no time. Please speak to your veterinarian regarding treatment options. She walks perfectly on the leash even when she sees another dog. Have not seen ANY reaction when passing another dog. Very potty trained and gentle beautiful dog.\n\nPrecious meets Yogi - https://youtu.be/sTvNxrvbJyU\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Katana (6 year old female, 105 pounds) and Kosmo (2 year old male, 102 pounds)are a bonded pair of Great Pyrenees. They were surrendered by their owner when she fell on hard times and could no longer afford to feed both of them and herself. They were beloved pets who are now confused by this turn of events. Kosmo is a super laid back guy who isn't phased by much of anything. Katana is a little jealous of other dogs around Kosmo, especially other ladies, so she would prefer a home with no other dogs. Both think cats are tasty snacks, so they need a no cat home. Both of them love people and are very gentle, so kids 12+ should be just fine. They walk nicely on leash, but require a fenced yard to call their own. They keep their kennel run clean, so are most likely housebroken. Katana and Kosmo are looking for a new home where they can spend the rest of their lives together, being loved for the majestic fuzz buckets they are. Great Pyrenees, or other livestock guardian experience is a plus.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

His favorite past-time is cuddling, and he does not understand personal space. When he snuggles, no matter how close he is to you, he wants to be closer! He's extremely gentle when taking food from your hand, and has zero food aggression towards people. He's our only foster we've ever had that doesn't care for peanut butter, which i think is hilarious! He loves a good game of fetch... he will show a tennis ball who's boss! We're working on drop it right now, when he brings it back. :-) He's definitely trainable! He's very graceful and light on his feet. We call it twinkle toes! He bonds quickly to humans, and if he knows you're his person, he is the most loyal dog ever and will make someone such a good companion, but would likely do best as the only pet in the home.

I\u2019m 2 years old, a Labrador mix, and a good boy. I love to play fetch, keep-away, and when you sing or dance, I love to dance too.\nI know all my commands, and quickly learn new ones. Especially if you give me treats. I\u2019ll do anything for a Scooby snack!\nI love sitting by your feet, snuggling under your arm, just generally being next to you. I\u2019ll never pull away when walking, -some days I dream of just getting rid of the leash, but my foster buddy won\u2019t allow it. Something about \u201cbeing responsible\u201d.\nI\u2019m loyal, handsome, and love being your one and only. I\u2019ll miss you when you\u2019re gone and smother you with loving when you come home. I\u2019ll remind you that you left me behind, unless you let me know you are going to work, the I\u2019ll go sleep in my bed till you come home.\nIf it seems like you and I could be a great match, reach out to my foster dad or my friends at Home Free!",

            "description": "Louise, 11 months old, 40 lbs. Good with dogs and kids over 12. Must have another dog in the home of similar size and must have a securely fenced yard.\n\nMeet Louise! This wonderful girl was part of a litter of puppies born on a rural property. The pups were not socialized or handled by humans until 8 months of age. As a result, Louise is shy with humans. She is making great progress and clearly wants to be with her person and follows her foster mom around the house. With time, she will get there but she will likely never be a social butterfly but a one-on-one love.\n\nLouise is getting more confident every day and is adorable when she plays. She loves running around the yard at high speed. She loves cuddles and belly rubs.\n\nLouise is just a lovely pup who needs a person to help her continue to gain confidence. She walks on a leash and is getting the hang of it but still needs a home with a yard and a secure fence. She does not have a mean bone in her body, but living with young kids is probably a bit stressful for her since she is not very confident. She cannot live with cats.\n\nLouise is bonded to her sister Lola, who is also with us, and in order to thrive in a new home, she will need another dog pal to live with her. We would like to see her in a more residential neighborhood rather than a busy part of town simply due to noise.\n\nShe is now updated on all shots, spayed, and is chipped. Her adoption fee is $495 and you can submit an application via savinggreatanimals.org\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

Some people think that it can be scary, but it's just my way of making friends! I'd love a calm home where I can be the only pup and get ALL the attention! I'm also housetrained, great during bath time, and a lover of wet food, cuddles, and long walks. I\u2019ve been neutered, made up to date on all necessary vaccines, microchipped, and tested negative for heartworm. I weigh 46 lbs and have an adoption fee of $160. We are first come first serve, so if you\u2019re interested, you can visit me at CHS in the Weiss Dog Run. We are open from 12 to 6 PM, Tuesdays through Saturdays, and process our last adoption at 5:30 PM. See you soon!",

My name is Cyrus (because my foster mom says I'm gonna be an \"achy breaky heartbreaker!).  I was found as a stray with horrible teeth and these things in my heart that make my cough.  Foster mom says its \"heartworms\".  Ok, since I'm older and wiser and think a lot, does that mean the worms that come out in my poo are called \"butt-worms\"?  Just wondering.....Oh, and I was given medicine for those and they disappeared!\n\nI am super sweet, love to cuddle and follow you around.  I am the perfect boy for someone who wants company all the time.  I promise I won't let you down, I will always be right there with you!  I go potty outside like a good boy and I am quick to whatever you want me to do.\n\nOnce I am seen by the nice doctor, I will let you know, but I think I might be losing a lot of teeth and then have to start my heartworm treatment.  But trust me, I'm worth the wait!\n\nJust because there's snow on the chimney doesn't mean there's not a fire inside!\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "\u201cListen up, Fives; a Ten is speaking\u201d - Jenna Maroney, 30 Rock \n \nIntroducing Jenna! At 11 months old and around 40 pounds, Jenna is the tallest of her sisters, Pearl and Aurora. We expect them to get just a little bit bigger before they are all done growing! \n \nJenna is still in her puppy stage, and she is learning so much about the world every day. She is fully crate trained, and she is almost housebroken. This little pup is able to sleep soundly all night long in her crate without having to be let outside to go to the bathroom, and when she is let outside, she takes care of business quickly. When Jenna is in a new space, the crate is where she feels most comfortable because the rest of the world can be really scary, and she likes to observe how things look before she\u2019s ready to jump in. With time and patience, Jenna will break out of her shell and see how great the world can be. \n \nNew places and people can be a little scary, but Jenna is confident around other dogs and is ready to play! She loves to run around the backyard, play chase, and sprint up and down stairs to get a furry friend to play with her. Jenna will dramatically flop down on a dog bed or roll around on the couch in the hopes that someone will see she\u2019s in a playful mood and come to investigate and join in on the fun. With a bit more confidence with her two-legged friends, Jenna will likely become a dog that likes a good trip to the dog park to meet more four-legged furry friends. \n \nJenna is very slow to warm up to humans, but she is gaining confidence every day. When she first arrived at her foster home, she would flinch and tuck her tail under her legs when someone would slowly reach for her to give her affection, but she is doing that less and less and is now giving nose kisses and tail wags when she\u2019s happy to see a familiar friendly face. Jenna loves some cuddle time on the couch for head scratches and snuggles once she trusts enough to be able to close her eyes and relax.\n \nUnlike a lot of young dogs, Jenna has been a star student on the leash! Going for a walk or short jog is one of Jenna\u2019s favorite activities, and she loves to burn off some of that puppy energy while getting to take a look at what\u2019s going on outside of her house -- from a safe distance, of course. \nEven though Jenna\u2019s personality sounds more like she should be labeled a weenie dog rather than a shepherd-hound mix, Jenna\u2019s got so much potential to blossom into a happy, healthy, and confident gal ready to tackle life with a new family. Contact us today if you think Jenna might be the right fit for you! \n\nIf you\u2019d like to be considered to adopt, the first step in the process is to submit an application through our website: http://athenscaninerescue.com/adoption-procedures/. Our adoption fee is $250 per dog over the age of 6 months and $300 per dog 6 months or younger. We accept payment by Venmo, PayPal, or card.\n\nThis includes: basic vet care (i.e. basic vaccinations, including boosters completed after adoption, spay/neuter, heartworm/flea preventatives, and treatment for any health needs while in our care), a microchip, a week\u2019s worth of food for the trial-period, and a harness lead.\n\nWe typically adopt to homes within 30 minutes of Athens, GA, as we require a basic home check to ensure all dogs are placed in a safe environment. If you are further away than that and are interested in one of our pups, please still fill out an application and we can discuss your options. \n\nWe do not have a facility and operate through a network of foster homes. Thus, we do not have a phone number. If you\u2019d like to discuss potential adoptions, please email at adopt@athenscaninerescue.com.",

            "description": "Introducing Castle. This handsome guy is around a year old. He is a young, energetic, active and athletic dog. Castle has a lot of great characteristics but he also has some quirks about him that will require an experienced owner. Castle has had a tough first year of his life and has been bounced around to multiple homes before ending up at the city shelter. He was lucky and found a foster with Friends of Rescue and we have been working hard on training and working on his anxiety behaviors. Castle does have some generalized anxiety as well as separation anxiety. With a structured home and a family that instills boundaries and training. Castle does know how to jump a 9 foot privacy fence with ease so his next home will have to prepare to learn how to care for his escape artist self. Castle's ideal home would be with an active family that will take him on hikes, runs, walks, bike rides and trips to the dog park. Castle currently lives with 4 other dogs before young and old, active and lazy. Castle loves to play with other dogs and would love to have another dog in his next home. He is good with cats but sometimes he chases them to try to play. We do not know how he is with children, he does jump so I would suggest no small children. If you are interested in adopting Castle please fill out an application on our website www.forrescue.net.\n\nCastle\u2019s next home needs to be his forever home, so please only serious inquires! He is being fostered in Harvest,AL. If you are interested in adopting please fill out an application on our website www.forrescue.net.",

He prefers to be wherever his person is and will follow you around all day! Cassius lives with other dogs and gets along well with them, but does need a home without cats. He loves to chew on a bully stick but doesn't much care about toys. If you're looking for a new best friend, e-mail foster@kcpetproject to meet Cassius!",

            "description": "This perfect little love nugget is Mogwai. She's squatty, snorty, extremely sweet and the happiest little girl around. She has a shining personality that evokes happiness and joy immediately upon entering a room. You truly can't be sad when she's around. \n\n\n\nThere's so much to love about this sweet little girl. She just loves life no matter what it throws at her. And just look at that smile, she is beautiful! She's so outgoing and loves all people, and you better believe ALL the people love her back. She loves to play.... slightly obsessed with tennis balls but any toy will do. She really enjoys a good game of fetch with her friends.\n\n\n\nHere in her foster home she has had exceptional behavior! She knows what's a toy and what isn't and she's potty/kennel trained. She absolutely loves TV time at night....she excitedly claims her spot on your lap and snuggles you so hard you've never felt so loved. It's absolutely adorable how she wiggles and squirms into just the right position. I've spent many a nights watching one more episode just so I can have a little bit more of her love. I promise you will too.\n\n\n\nThis is her second time with KCPP. She was once abandoned and now returned by her adoptive family of 2 years due to no fault of her own. \n\nShe's just asking for a chance at a home that will love her for the rest of her days. In return, she will promise many laughs and future snuggles, and make a great walking partner. I promise she'd make the absolute most of the life you can offer her. She needs to be an only pet, can live with older children and will most certainly be your best friend! Give this sweet girl a chance and make her dreams come true!\n\n\n\nIf you want to turn your gray skies blue and your frown upside down, then email her foster mom at ang35847@aol.com.... she is sure to be the sunshine of your life and without a doubt you will be hers!",

Foster mom calls him Big Red since he is sensitive about being called old and he is full of youthful fun. Red is good with other dogs and people.

I also have a micro chip. I was adopted in 2008 and moved to Texas with my new family. They moved back to Mobile into a home that doesn't allow dogs. I am now looking for another home. I am a senior dog, but don't let that scare you away. I am in great shape for my age and you don't have to worry about house training me or getting up in the middle of the night to take me on a potty break. I enjoy napping! I am easy going and loveable. I can be protective of my owner, but very obedient. Please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online adoption application and someone from the office will give you a call and set up an appointment for you to come meet me. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $100\nHeart Worm Negative\n50 Pounds\n13 Years Old\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.  Screening and approval by our Adoption Coordinators and a home visit  may be required to make sure  this pet fits into your home and the home fits our pet.\n\nCONTACT US:If you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531 or drop by our Adoption Center located at 620 Zeigler Circle W, Mobile, AL 36608 - Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!</strong> </strong>This wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity.\n\nThank you!",

She loves riding on the golf cart and visiting all of her friends and greeting everyone with kisses and cuddles. Although she is a senior girl, she still has a lot of spunk and likes to show off her happy zoomies when she gets treats. Fiesta walks great on leash and is very calm and polite around other dogs, but she would prefer to be the only dog in the home. She has some special medical needs, so please reach out to the adoptions team to get more information and consider making this wonderful girl part of your family.",

She was an owner surrender in Oklahoma after her master died and was taken to a high kill shelter to be euthanized. She is Heartworm positive and is currently undergoing treatment. Her skin was in horrible shape and she barely had any fur when she was pulled from the shelter. She still gets baths twice a week and is on medication to address her skin issues. This will be an ongoing schedule for awhile. She is very gentle and just wants love. She craves human interaction. She needs a loving home with no small dogs, cats, or small children as she gets excited and can knock them over. Here heartworm treatment will be covered by Hope until she tests negative in a few months. She needs a retirement home where she can just chill, love her family, and be loved and cared for the way she deserves. If you would like to meet Temperance, please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application Adoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.",

He know commands such as sit, paw, speak, lay down and is learning stay. Boomer is trustworthy with free roam and knows not to chew. He will bark to alert like all good guard dogs do, and will dig if bored. Boomer enjoys car rides and his favorite toy is his tennis balls. He does well with cats, dogs and kids. Boomer's prior family faced financial struggles and has been forced to move. Unfortunately, they couldn't take him with. He does show signs of anxiety and this change will likely heighten those unsure feelings. Boomer boy is looking for a family who can make sure he feels secure and loved. Are you the one!?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family.

He needs to go to a home with no chickens! He learned chickens can be pretty fun for a pup! He also needs a home with no small children (under the age of 5) in the home. He did great with the 7 year old but the little tiny one little would get excited and squeal and it got him excited. She said it was never aggressive just him wanting to play and being to rough. Kyler is a super sweet and goofball of a puppy! He weighs approximately 40ish pounds. He is all legs and tongue! ?\nEmail Savannah at operationcareadoptions@yahoo.com for more information!!",

She loves adults and greets strangers with enthusiasm, but needs to be in a home with children above the age of twelve. Also, she must go to a home with no other dogs, cats, fish, zebras, whales, and last but not least . . . chinchillas :-) She is a fun-loving dog who will lay on the couch with you (if you want) and watch hours and hours of Netflix . . . although she will interrupt you from time-to-time with one or more of her infectious, pig-like snorts.

            "description": "BO, shelter number D20-11018, is a young Brittany Spaniel mix male. He is about one year old and weighs about 30 to 35 pounds. He was surrendered by his owner to the shelter for unknown reasons.\nBO is a little shy when he meets new people at first, but he warms up quickly when you show him some love and care. He walks well on leash and does love attention. He should fit into just about any household and make a good pet with just alittle adjustment time. He should be good with kids of any age. He should be good with other dogs as he enjoyed visiting with the other shelter dogs through the chain link fence in the runs.\nBO is a pretty rugged dog but has short hair and won\u2019t tolerate cold weather very well. We hope his new family can find a place for him to sleep indoors, especially in the winter. He would love to be included in family activities anytime, indoors or out.\nBO is looking for a fresh start in a new home. If you think he would be a good fit for your family and would like to meet him for a possible adoption, please come out to the shelter at 109 Commerce Drive in Levelland from 9 AM till noon or from 2:00 to 5:00 PM on any day of the week except Tuesday and Wednesday to meet him. On Tuesday or Wednesday, you will need to make an appointment at least two hours in advance. You can call the shelter during shelter hours (9 till noon and 2 to 5) at (806) 891-0829. To call at other hours, dial (806) 894-6164 and ask to speak with an Animal Control employee. When speaking with an Animal Control employee, be sure to refer to BO by his shelter number, D20-11018. If you would like more information, please send a message through messenger on \"The Levelland Animal Shelter\u201d Facebook page.\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee, but the adopter will be responsible for having the dog spayed or neutered and for the Rabies shot.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter.\n",

            "description": "~~~~~\n\n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, December 5th, 2020 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

            "description": "Floofy and Houdini are looking for a home together. \nWe are requiring a fenced yard for this pair. \nBecause of Houdini's shyness, we are looking for an adult home for this pair.\nHoudini didn't have much confidence until he met Floofy.  Houdini has been much happier and is soaking up the companionship of his fluffy Floofy.  And Floofy was separated from a dog she had bonded with. Houdini and Floofy live in the same foster home and have really hit it off with each other and hope they can be adopted together. \n\nOur normal adoption fee is $300 for a dog.  They would have a reduced adoption fee of $500.00 for both dogs.\n\nFloofy, Bichon Mix, 4 yrs , 10lbs, rescued from a home that didn't take good care of her, great with dogs, full of energy, ideal home would include a four-legged playmate named Houdini, fenced yard so I can run and play, when worn out from playing, favorite place to sleep is on your lap\n\nHoudini - Chihuahua Mix, 2yrs, 11lbs,\n Houdini,  when you're not looking, I might run off with your socks or a dryer sheet, a timid little guy but once he gets to know you, your constant companion. loves giving kisses, and being right beside you whether you are sitting on the sofa or cooking in the kitchen, loves snuggling under a blanket and chasing bugs in the yard or squirrels on the fence,  love treats, loud noises and lots of activity can sometimes be scary,  housebroken and working on leash training, best with  fenced yard, adopted with Floory, a diamond in the \"ruff\", but if you can be patient, he will work his magic on your heart\n\n\nRequirements for Adoption:\nMust live in the Central Ohio area.  For rescues/shelters across Ohio, visit:  ColumbusDogConnection.com/RescuesShelters.html\nMust be over the age of 24 to adopt.\nYour resident pets must be spayed/neutered.\n\nAdoption Process:\n We do not have an application. Adoptions are pet-adopter driven.\nTo meet our pets:\nCall our office at 614-471-9000 or click on the pet which you are interested in and send email. We will be happy to discuss the adoption process with you and set-up a visit at time of contact. The foster dogs are in foster homes and most of the cats reside at our office.\n\nThe adoption process includes a lease manager reference (if applicable) , a veterinarian reference, a home-visit (in-person or virtual).\nIf you've never owned a pet, part of our adoption process requires that you call several vet offices to compare services, prices, and availability. \nQuestions to ask include:\nHow many doctors are at your practice?\nCan I request to see a specific Vet or would I be scheduled with first available?\nWhat are your hours?\nHow much is:   annual exam, heartworm test & tablets, an x-ray,  vaccines, a non-emergency office call? \nDo you recommend vaccines every year or every three years?  (every 3 yrs as suggested by the AVMA)           \n\nThe pooches that visit your home will not be left there at the end of the visit. We take them back home with us so your family can discuss to ensure he/she is a good fit for your home.\n\nThere is an adoption agreement and adoption fees as follows:\n $300 for Adult Dogs (6yrs  & younger)\n $200 for Senior Dogs (7 yrs and older)\n $80 for Cats  \n\n All pets are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested (dogs), fiv/leukemia tested (cats), & micro-chipped.\nKnown medical conditions are discussed at time of inquiry.",

My owners were breeding me according to several people that received pups.  However, they did not claim me after I got loose.  Fortunately, this shelter spoke up for me so I am now safe.  I sometimes duck when the volunteers go to pet me so they wonder if I have been hit before.  Once I know you I act silly and try to get you to play with me.  I do sometimes have an accident overnight but keep my kennel clean always during the day. I am hoping to be a house dog and a fence is necessary as I love to run.  I have not been here long enough to be around other dogs yet but I will be tested and hopefully be out running in the dog parks with other furry friends soon.  I will look forward to meeting you.  My adoption fee is $160.00. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please fill out our short Adoption Application to start the adoption process. An adoption application can be completed & submitted on our website yorkadoptapet.com. For more information on any of the dogs available for adoption contact kim@yorkadoptapet.com. All applications need to be approved prior to adoption and approval may take up to 1 week.",

Poor Hamby was abandoned by his family at the shelter but we don\u2019t know why because he\u2019s such a nice guy! He is shy at first but once he knows you he will be the love of your life. He walks well on a leash and knows basic commands and would love to learn more! He is such a gem and really deserves a second chance. \n\nAGE\n1.5  years\n\nInterested in Hamby?

It took weeks of healthy food (and treatment of intestinal parasites) for her to reach her current body weight of about 40 pounds, she still needs to be on another 7-10lbs. Anxious at first, she was intolerant of almost all other dogs. During her stay at SSAR, Peaches has had the opportunity to meet dogs of different breeds and temperaments. She can now have supervised play with her rescue buddy, Diesel, whose goal in life is to have fun! She enjoys the company of people, and off leash she mostly just wants to stick by your side.?\nAs her confidence has grown, Peaches continues to show her attraction to humans. She does well on a leash and is beginning to learn commands, particularly when not distracted by other dogs. She is a sweet and loving girl and deserves to know a loving home for the first time in her life.",

            "description": "Meet Lyla, we had to take action in less than 48 hours to help this sweet girl.  Lyla is a 13-year-old black beauty whose life took an unexpected turn. As many older labs she has some arthritis in her legs plus some nerve damage in one foot. Her legs are not as strong as they once were. Her family has recently moved north and decided the cold would not be good for her arthritis. In addition, the living accommodations they chose have stairs and Lyla is not able to climb stairs on her own so they contacted us. Lyla weighs 60 pounds and her only issue appears to be some small fatty tumors and the weakness in her legs, she has had a recent checkup which confirms this as well. She is alert, LOVES food but needs to be careful to keep her lean so she is better able to get around. Lyla has a good routine, she asks to go to the bathroom, but you will need to remind her as she settles into a new surrounding and learns her way around. Lyla is pretty and so sweet; she loves people and loves to follow her person around the house. She enjoys going outside and is good on a leash, but the walks need to be short and on grass. Her pads are very soft and because of the nerve issue, concrete may injure her paw. She can maneuver indoor floor surfaces very well. Lyla is a good car rider and will greet every morning with a happy bounce!  Lyla will need a family on the quiet side. She is good with kids and other dogs but she is not really sturdy enough on her feet to be in a home with younger dogs or younger children. Lyla will need a parent that is home much of the time, although she is well house trained and will generally nap while you are gone. Lyla would be excellent companion to a retired individual that lives is a rancher with no stairs and a fenced in yard.   Lyla needs a patient dog loving parent that understands the joys of caring for an older dog. Her vision sees pretty good and her hearing seems to be okay at different octaves. Her sense of smell remains very keen. She will need parents that will take care of her changing physical needs, currently she is on Cosequin and she would benefit from water therapy to keep her legs strong.  She desires, parents that will spend time with her, love on her, work on mental and environmental stimulation, and feed her appropriately. She is a happy lab but just cannot wiggle like she used to. She needs one story living with no step access to a grassy outside area.  Lyla does not bark or really make any sounds; she needs someone alert she stands at the door to go out. Lyla is spayed and will be microchipped and up to date on vaccinations prior to adoption. Lyla is a proud dog, who will enhance your life and needs love and support for the rest of her life. Please consider Lyla.  Sponsorship towards the adoption fee is available to the right home. To be considered please complete our online pre-adoption application. http://www.southernskiesrescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Deac is a 6 year old Harlequin Great Dane who doesn't let his age slow him down. Deac has high energy for a Dane of his age but at times has trouble going up stairs and just needs to take it slow doing so. Deac gets along well with other dogs but will bark at every dog he sees due to over excitement. Aside from the barking, he is very good on leash. He will stay fairly close to you whenever he is on a walk. He is also very gentle with everyone he needs. Whenever he meets someone for the first time, they instantly fall in love with his loving nature. Loud noises don't seem to bother him but he is very attentive to every noise. Getting baths isn't a problem for Deac, as long as the water stays off his head and loves getting dried off afterwards with a towel. As most Danes love being next to their humans and want nothing but to be loved. Deac is no different. Whether it's going for a little walk or laying on the couch, Deac is happy with either. The more you love him, the more he will love you back. Deac is a very gentle dog who is looking for his furever home.\n\nUpdate Nov 18\nDeac is still an older dog but trapped inside of a younger dog's body. Despite being 6, you would never be able to tell. He is very energetic and doesn't let his age slow him down. Deac is very gentle with any human he meets, whether it's an infant or an elderly individual. Deac, whenever being introduced to another dog, needs a very slow introduction. Deac comes across really aggressive at first but with a slow introduction, he will warm up to them. Whenever introducing Deac to another dog, there cannot be any other dogs around because he will become aggressive and won't be able to warm up. He needs his full attention on one dog at a time. \n\n   For cats, it is unknown as to whether he can be around them or not. For walks, Deac gets excited and will pull but once he gets the initial excitement out, he does really well. As stated before, he gets very excited and a little aggressive around the initial interaction around another dog that whenever he sees another dog on a walk, he will get excited and lunge towards them while barking. You'll have to pull him away and get him out of sight of the other dog. He is very treat motivated and has gotten a lot better with the lunging and barking with the walks. With a little more time and effort, he will get over that behavior. Overall, Deac is an amazing and loving dog that loves everyone. He is very young at heart and wants nothing more than for people to love him. \n\nUpdate 1/7/2021\nDeac is a very loving Dane who wants nothing more than love from his humans. Deac is a 6 year old Dane who doesn't let his age get in the way. Though Deac is 6, he can still move around without any problem.  Like most Danes, Deac will get the zoomies and be his playful self. At the same time, Deac is very content with getting in his bed and laying down with his blanket. Whenever Deac goes to a new place, his energy goes up but will settle as he gets accustomed to his new home. When it comes to temperament, Deac is a very easy going dog that can read a room and adjust his energy level to match yours. Deac is very gentle and is great around people of all ages. You will not have to worry about Deac hurting small children or adults of older age. When it comes to other pets, you have to be very careful if you want to socialize Deac with other pets. \n   Deac is a very curious dog and has to have strict one on one interactions. If there are other animals running around Deac whenever you're trying to introduce him, he gets very distracted and becomes very aggressive to the other pets. If Deac can have that one on one interaction, he will warm up to the other animal. This is also the fact with going on a walk. Deac is very well behaved on a leash in terms of pulling. If there are no other dogs around, Deac is very good on leash. You'll only have to worry whenever there is another dog in sight. Deac will get very excited and start to lunge towards the other dogs and bark. Even though he does this, he has come a long way and is getting better with it, he still needs work on completely stopping this act. Deac will be adopted with a training contract to help the new adopter learn how to manage this and to teach Deac how to react better. Deac is very food motivated and tends to try and counter surf, especially if there is cake on the counter, Deac loves to try and eat cake. Deac has a skin sensitivity to some foods where his skin will turn red, getting food that is skin and stomach sensitivity friendly is perfect for him. He is the perfect dog for those who are looking for a youthful at heart dog that wants all the love and affection. If you shower him with love, he will do the same, or possibly shower you in slobber.\n\nDogs-case by case\nCats- No\nKids- 8+\n\n\n\n\nMAGDRL only adopts to approved adopters in NY, NJ, PA MD, DE, D.C.,VA and WV.

EFFECTIVE 1/1/2020.\nAnyone interested in meeting or wanting more info on one of our available dogs MUST CONTACT US BY PHONE at 412 795 0163 and leave a message. NO EMAILS WILL BE ANSWERED.\n\nThe first time you meet Scooby you will say the same thing I said, \"THERE IS NO WAY THIS DOG IS 12 YEARS OLD!\" But it is true, his paperwork says its true. If you look at the first picture of him you will get an idea of his energy, his ears are flapping from the speed he is running toward me. He is always in motion and he craves human attemtion. Scooby came to us when his elderly owner went to assisted living. We are told Scooby was an \"OUTSIDE DOG\" all his life. I am not sure if that means he was chained, or if he had an outside kennel. We do know that his owner huinted with him, but again not sure if it was waterfowl or upland. Reguardless, if you are looking for an active older dog who will look at you like you are a god, this is your boy. He is healthy, vaccinated, buit is on the very thin side. Because of his weight he has not been neutered at this time.\n\n Please call SPARRO if you would like more info or to set up a visit with Scooby",

A properly trained and socialized blue heeler is an excellent family dog. He is agile and tireless, loves to run and play with children and is an affectionate, fun-loving companion. He is an inside dog but loves to run outside but will dig or jump out of a fence if he is left. He needs a job or a very active family! HATES CATS. \nOur adoption fees:\nFor dogs 7 and younger: $225\nFor dogs 8 and older: $175\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our doggies.

Joaquin is around three years old, current on shots, and excited to have a  person or family to call his own. Just a happy boy who is filled with joy and unconditional love to share. Joaquin seems to get along well with most other dogs and is super charming. Maybe you have the most perfect forever home for Joaquin? Stop by the shelter for a visit with him today in adopt him into your heart and home.\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",
