At the shelter, she minds her own business and doesn't instigate with other dogs so if you have a fenced in yard to keep her away from other dogs and cats, she'll be fine in your neighborhood, but if approached by other animals, she will assert her dominance. \n\n\n\nNellie cannot go to an active home that have people coming and going, and she cannot go with children. Nellie would do best with a single owner who respects that she needs to be put up when visitors come to the home as she can get protective of her person. Due to her vocalization and special needs, she needs a home with a fenced yard, no apartment living for her. \n\n\n\nNellie will not be a fit for most families; however, we know her perfect owner is out there. Nellie does great at the shelter with structure and guidance and a set routine. Nellie needs an owner who will provide stability and routine for her to help her feel safe and secure.",

He did have some trouble decompressing when he first arrived at TAPS . Since he has settled in, he seems great. He does have some sensitive areas where he might give out a little warning growl if you touch him in the wrong place but that is due to carry over from a rough life. It appears he had a collar embedded in his neck at one point. \n\nWhile he can act a little grouchy in his kennels when other dogs walk by, we have done a dog intro with him and he actually did very well. \n\nWe do suggest a quieter, adult only home for Boss because we think he still carries scars from his past but give this baby a chance to trust and you'll have a friend for life. He may also need some guidance on re-potty training but a few gentle reminders should set him on the potty training path. He does not like to be handled around the neck, we believe this is from his past and his embedded collar but he seems fine being handled everywhere else.",

            "description": "Lois Lane is looking for her next Clark Kent! Could you be the one to save her?\n\nLois Lane is a 4.5 y/o pocket pittie/terrier mix. We believe she would do best in an active household with a big fenced yard. She is a staff and volunteer favorite because her spunky attitude and zest for life brings a laugh and a smile to everyone's face. We discovered over the summer that she absolutely LOVES swimming so would love to see her go to a home where she can have access to a pool. \n\nHer adventurous personality has led her over fences and through kennels and crates, so we are hoping she can go to a home with a tall fence or with someone who is committed to keeping her on a long tie out while she is inside the fenced yard! She has a wonderful, active personality and we believe she would do best in an adult-only home and with a very active adoptive family. \n\nApply for her at www.tapsshelter.org!\n\nUPDATE: Lois Lane is a 5-1/2 year-old, 44-pound, female, low-rider pit bull mix who came to TAPS one year ago and although she came with no information, we have learned so much about her during her stay at TAPS. Lois' story started last November when she was found running as a stray in Metropolis, Illinois, with another dog and was transferred to TAPS after no one claimed to own her. Given that she was a stray, she had no background information, but we have discovered that she is a sweet, fun, and sassy girl with lots of energy - and so much more! \n\nI have taken Lois to my home several times, and outside the shelter, I witness a different dog every time - still a sassy dog, but a fun girl! And although Lois is well-adjusted at the shelter, she has the appearance in her kennel of being high-spirited, and extremely excited who will bark excessively to get your attention, but this is the only way she knows how to get your attention. \n\nFor starters, Lois is bursting with anticipation to go for a ride and do something fun and has a cute \"snort\" when she is overly excited. Lois loves car rides and prefers to ride standing on the center console of my car so she can get a clear view of her surroundings and to see where she is going. Since this is her favorite spot in the car, it is not surprising that when she was transported to TAPS initially, she broke loose from her crate to sit in the front seat. But this is not to say that she does not like to be crated; in fact, she prefers to be in a crate when her kennel is being cleaned. \n\nLois is a fun dog with a spunky spirit and personality. At my house, she is extremely curious of her surroundings and relishes at any opportunity to be active. When I first brought her to my house, she showed enormous interest in my swimming pool and, although it was clear she had never swam before, she quickly realized she could swim and smiled the entire time with excitement of her new found activity. From that day after, she made several trips to my house to go swimming and after swimming for nearly an hour, she would then want to go for a hike. Due to her high energy level, she would not be a good fit for adopters that are couch potatoes. And potential adopters should know that Lois can, and will, climb a chain link fence if left unattended. \n\nWith the colder weather, Lois' future visits have been regulated to inside my house where I learned surprisingly new things about her. Since Lois has such a high energy level, I thought she would run through my house, slide across my hardwood hallways knocking over my Christmas decorations, pee on the carpet, and, largely, be too excited to be inside; however, I was pleasantly wrong! After she thoroughly inspected my house, she began to settle in and take the bones that I gave her and piled them by the back door - clearly she wanted to take them outside to perhaps bury or simply save for a later date. Also, to my surprise, she did not pee, or attempt to pee, in my house and when I said \"let's go potty outside\" she got a look on her face where it was clearly evident she knew what that meant. In hindsight, this should not have surprised me since Lois always has a clean kennel and waits to go potty outside for her morning walk. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, Lois was found running with another dog, so it is presumed she is dog friendly; however, she has had several meet-and-greets with other dogs, and they did not go as well as we had hoped for as we discovered Lois plays very hard with other dogs and does not appear to pick up on other dogs' cues to back down from play. For that reason, it appears that other dogs may not be in Lois' future, however TAPS has not discounted Lois' ability to be with other dogs yet because Lois may be acting like this during the meet-and-greets due to kennel stress and is willing to try another dog introduction in the future. \n\nDuring Lois' stay with TAPS, we have also learned that Lois absolutely loves all people that she meets; except small children and we have witnessed her become extremely reactive to small children that have entered the shelter. Given Lois' reaction to small children, we believe she is trying to tell us that she may have been teased by small children in the past. Accordingly, we believe Lois lived in a house with children, although probably not well supervised children, and is potty trained. \n\nOverall, Lois will make a great companion for anyone who is active, does not have small children (older children are okay), and would most likely not do well in a quiet home with non-energetic people. But if you are a looking for a sassy, fun, well-rounded, active girl - Lois Lane would be perfect!",

She is a professional napper and likes to cuddle with her people, give kisses, hangout on the couch, explore the backyard and roam through the flower beds. She has been getting a crash course on manners and now sits and downs on command. She loves taking walks and is getting better about walking on lead without pulling. At 60 lbs, Gladys is strong and highly reactive to other animals pulling and lunging when she meets them. We are working to help her become less reactive and she is improving but should be the lone pet in a household. She is working on being crate trained and is eating meals and treats in the kennel to become more accustomed to it. She is a great dog and will be a fabulous addition to the right family.",

When Orchestra joined the One Love family, she had been surrendered to the shelter along with her 11 puppies. She was a great mama to her babies who have all been adopted, and now it's her turn to find her forever home! Orchestra is a playful girl, she has fun romping in the yard chasing her ball. She is very affectionate, and enjoys being with people and part of the activities of the household. She gets along with other dogs and has even learned to live with a few cats. Orchestra is good with children, she would probably be best with school age kids just because her size could make her accidentally topple a little one, but she's friendly to everyone. She's about 70 lbs, spayed, house trained and up to date on vaccinations. To find out more about this very special girl, or set up a meet and greet, fill out our pre-adoption application! https://oneloveanimalrescue.com/pre-adoption-application/",

Anyway, this job helps me exercise my skills of chasing squirrels, being observant, and following directives like sit and lay down. \n\nBeing fit is important to me and I enjoy going on walks/jogs. I am great on leash and know to sit and wait before crossing the street. I get a lot of compliments every time I leave the house due to not only my good looks but my good manners. \n\nMy ideal family will be active, have a fenced in yard and no other pets.

            "description": "Hey ya'll! My name is DOVER and I am a little over 2 years old!!! I have been with One Love since I was about 3 months old and all of my brothers and sisters have found their furever homes. Annnddd, I would really, really like to find my person(s) to watch over and love with all my might. So, I have asked my super cool foster mom and dad to help me put into words what would be my perfect fit*(see below)*! Maybe you are wondering why I am still with my foster parents for over a year now. Well, they have told me I have allergies to several things in my environment and they are most likely in everyone's environment, so I eat special food and need allergy shots about every 4-8 weeks depending which part of our lovely Georgia season we are currently in. My skin was a mess when I was waaay younger and I had to go to a place called \"the Vet\" so often that now I really don't like going there at all. Car rides scare me but I am getting better and can sometimes look out the window when we are going down the road. I am working on meeting new people and trusting them around those I love. I love to play with my foster brother because we have the same \"energy\" level (it can go from super high to just lounging on the deck watching the birds). I don't understand older dogs who don't want to roughhouse. I know everyone loves kids but they are not for me, can't help it (I don't trust them). I really just need a small family that I can hang out with, watch over and have them watch over me. Let me know if you want to meet!\n\nDover would do best with a single person or couple without children or a lot of people coming and going, he needs consistency. He needs someone who will watch his skin color and behaviors that will tell when his allergies are getting bad, which can put him in a bad mood because he is miserable (the allergy shots are a savior). Dover is always on alert, until he trusts (a person or situation), so it is hard for him to relax and be the happy go-lucky dog who wants to meet everyone. New situations can overwhelm Dover and he needs to be handled with confidence and attention. He does not like larger crowds of people or dogs. He loves to play - whether it is tug-o-war with a rope or throwing his favorite toy to himself - but also loves to lounge around just knowing you have his back just as much as he has yours. He will always let you know if someone or something is out of the ordinary around the house. Dover is a super handsome and good boy who is just looking for his person to watch over and be best of buds.",

When he came to us, he didn't want to lay down and would fall asleep standing up. So very heartbreaking. Well he is getting comfortable now, LOVES attention and affection and is ready to learn. He is so very smart and treat motivated and any family who welcomes him in should only excel in his training if they are willing to teach him. He does well with other dogs and children. No cats please. He is about 70lbs.",

This sweetheart is house- and crate-trained, and loves other dogs. Dug is still a bit shy around cats and would benefit from on-going training with his forever family.

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nSilly boy FarleyDate into Rescue: Originally 1/6/2017, adopted and returned in 2018\nReason for being in rescue: Farley was originally found as a stray in SC and taken to a local shelter. CPR pulled him from the shelter. Farley was adopted and lived in a home for almost a year. He was returned to CPR in 2018 when his owners were unable to manage his behavior - his epilepsy was just starting and was not controlled\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Farley is an epileptic - controlled. He is takes medication 3 times per day. The medication he is on is called Keppra (generic name Levetiracetam). This can be purchased at Walmart or Chewy.com and runs roughly .35 cents per day). He MUST have his dose every 8 hours so please make sure your schedule allows this.\nWeight: about 32 lbs\nHeight: about 12 in at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1, I am special\n\nFence needed? Farley would love a fence to run around in, but it is not a necessity.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Farley would do best in a high energy experienced home with no other animals. He is fabulous with people, and wants all the belly rubs in the world! Farley needs a home where he has experienced dog owners, that can manage his behavior and his seizures! He is not to go to a home with a first time dog owner. Farley would do best in a home where there are no kids under the age of 12. He is a lover, but has his moments. He is not aggressive towards people, but he is dog selective and needs to be carefully watched around any dogs. .\n\nWhat is my personality like? Farley originally came into the rescue from a South Carolina shelter as a stray. He was adopted a few months later but recently returned due to not getting along with other dogs. While he was here with us the first time, Farley got along great with other dogs, but that did not work when he was in a home. We think once he is comfortable in his own space and claims his home he does not like to share his things and will resource guard toys, his crate, and sometimes even people. Other than that he is a joy to be around! Farley is very wiggly and so happy with his caregivers! He really doesn't meet a stranger. He adores toys, especially tennis balls and will play with his toys all day until the cows come home. Farley is also very intelligent, and will do anything for a treat. He knows how to sit, lay down, stay, and possibly even a few more. He loves people, there is not a shy bone in his body. His previous adopters had a wisdom panel DNA test on him. We had him listed as a corgi but it turns out, he is not a Corgi at all! His main breeds are Alaskan Malamute, Chow Chow, Dachshund, Golden/Lab Retriever. A true Heinz 57 pup that is looking for someone to understand his needs. We've left corgi on his description simply because he is long and low looking like a corgi.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Farley has a lot of potential - he just needs an experienced owner to give him a chance!\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

His owner got him as a gift for their daughter and said she is not taking care of him so they brought him here. He lived with 3 children in the home. ((Poor Baby) Rico has been very snarky here with everyone who tries to interact-but for some reason he loves me. He was very easy for me to leash and in no time he began to play and dance around me. He put his paws on my knees and rubbed his head into my hand to pet him. I had no trouble at all with him and he seemed very grateful for the attention. I asked another staff to visit him and she had no luck becoming his friend. And a few staff were walking towards us in the hallway, and he hard barked and snarked at them. I think he just needs someone to feel safe with and I am hopeful he can transfer his affections he has towards me onto another rescue person! Rico is HW negative. I adore this boy, and he adores me too-but he can be very selective about other human friends. He made a few friends today with a couple other staff who coaxed him with tennis balls. He is definitely better with women and does NOT like people in uniform at all. New pic shows that I can easily handle him and pick him up.",

            "description": "Honey is ~3.5 years old and currently 72 pounds. She should probably be around 65 pounds. Honey is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, and HW negative and on preventative! She is house-trained and dog and kid friendly, but very high energy. Honey probably shouldn't be in a home with cats, small dogs, or small kids (teens should be okay). She really needs to be with a very active person or family. She would be perfect for someone that runs daily. She loves to swim (especially after a run)! Honey is playful and good-natured. She's not a crawl in your lap kind of dog, but she does lick my chin and sits next to me so I can pet her.\n\nHoney was recently surrendered by her family because they could not provide the daily exercise she needs to be on her best behavior. I am fostering her in Fairdealing, MO. I have all of her medical records and she appears healthy!\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n* 3.5 years old\n* Only been in a crate to travel\n* Used doggy door\n* Good with friendly, playful male dogs. No females.\n",

He does have \u201cdry eye\u201d and requires drops every day for the rest of his life, but it\u2019s very treatable. Percy needs to be an only dog and he is blind in one eye...but that does not slow him down.\n\nAll our pets are spayed or neutered, vaccinated including rabies, given de-wormer, heartworm negative or being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention, on flea/tick prevention, most are house trained. The majority but not all of our pets require a fence. Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered. We adopt within 300 miles of New Orleans/Baton Rouge, La and we do not ship or transport--Adoption fee $200. Email us at creolepoodlerescue@yahoo.com to get an adoption application. Complete an adoption form and email it back to us (we do not have a FAX) if interested in adopting and providing a loving home for this pet.  If you can't email it to us, you can mail it to P.O. Box 2333, Gonzales, La 70707, but this will slow the process down.\n\nWhen you request an adoption application, we will also send you our guidelines to read - many questions you may have are answered there.  All of our pets are in private foster homes. We require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of our pets. Everything we know at this time about this pet is posted.IF YOU SEE THIS PET POSTED ON OUR ADOPTABLE PETS PAGE, THIS PET IS AVAILABLE. WE UPDATE OUR ADOPTABLE PETS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.  IF THE WORD PENDING IS NEXT TO THE NAME, THE PET HAS AN APPROVED ADOPTER COMING TO MEET AND PROBABLY ADOPT HIM OR HER.  We reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.\n\nWe are all VOLUNTEERS and have full time jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner.  Please realize that turning in an application today will not mean that you adopt a poodle tomorrow.  We believe in taking the time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the family.",

No, really, we want you to meet this derpy dude. He's around a year old and weighs about 70 pounds, but definitely a trim 70. He tries to be in tip top shape! \n\nDexter is a bit shy when he first meets people, but if you\u2019re nice to him and maybe give him some treats (subtle, right?), he'll love you BIG time! Sometimes he thinks men can be particularly scary to meet, but he's really drawn to them once he realizes they are kind. And that they have treats. Treats help a ton. \n\nDexter really is the sweetest, silliest boy. In fact, despite his size, Dexter strongly believes that your lap is his lap and will happily join you for a big slobbery kiss.  \n\nDo you have another canine family member? Dexter has done great with small dogs and we think he can live with bigger dogs, too, but will need a slow and appropriate introduction to any doggy siblings. \n \nBecause Dexter can be a bit shy, a low-traffic, adult-only home (or a low-traffic home with older kids) would be best for him. He'd also like a home without cats. He really just doesn't understand those creatures. \n\nDexter is an athletic sort of pooch and needs a 6-foot privacy fence because he can be a little bit of an escape artist. He loves to play fetch with a ball, so keeping Dexter and his human(s) entertained is easy peasy. He's super treat motivated, too. (In case you haven't gotten the hint, the way to Dexter's heart is definitely through his stomach. And his stomach likes treats.) \n\nHow about we get together to see if you\u2019re Dexter's forever person/family? \n\nCall/text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387. He's in the Kansas City metro, but transport is available to the right home. Let's do this!\n\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET? Fill out an Adoption Application now! Appointments can also be made to meet a pet by calling us at 913-671-PETS (913-671-7387).  \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nPrior to adoption, our animals are: \n**Tested for diseases \n**Vaccinated \n**Spayed/neutered \n**Microchipped \n\nNO COST adoptions with an encouraged donation are accepted. \n\nThe Pet Connection also offers adopters a FREE veterinary examination and a medical care support plan for 60 days after adoption, as well as lifetime behavioral training, safe sanctuary for pets returned in emergency situations, extensive assistance with lost and found pets, and other expert pet services in a variety of areas, including pet selection, behavioral issues, general training, nutrition, and transition to adoptive homes.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.thepetconnection.org for more information about The Pet Connection and for a full listing of our available pets, \n\nCall or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 if you can foster, adopt, or sponsor a special needs dog or cat! \n\nThe Pet Connection is a membership organization operating a no-kill adoption center located in Shawnee, Kansas.\n\n",

He was left behind by his family at some point during the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic and was found trying to take care of himself. He never deserved that. He deserves to be loved and treated as the amazing family member that he\u2019s proven to be in his foster home. He\u2019ll make a fantastic addition to anyone\u2019s life.",

This cutie-patootie has a huge heart, though like some people, she is struggling with anxiety. However, she is growing more confident every day, and is ready to take on life with a fur-ever family.\n\nWhen you first meet Pearl, she may put on a tough face, barking and growling, but thanks to the training her fosters have provided, she is getting more comfortable and confident. She tries so hard to show her hidden well-behaved, easygoing personality. She will need lots of work to trust strangers, but when she\u2019s with \u201cher\u201d people, she showers them with kisses and cuddles.\n\nPearl is a smarty-pants who knows \u201csit,\u201d \u201cpaw,\u201d \u201chigh-five,\u201d and \u201cdown.\u201d Additionally, she is potty trained and muzzle trained. Apart from stranger danger, two areas that still need polishing are jumping on her family and barking due to separation anxiety. However, at her core, Pearl is a faster learner who is motivated by attention and treats. \n\nPearl\u2019s typical exercise routine consists of going on short walks, but she also enjoys going on hikes and playing with toys. Afterwards, she likes to relax by sunbathing or lounging on her bed. Though Pearl enjoys a bit of activity, she is non-destructive and fairly low energy, making her well-adapted for less active homes. \n\nPearl will flourish with a dog-savvy, experienced owner(s) who can continue to train and socialize her. Pearl very much dislikes strangers and the vet, and though she\u2019s come a long way, it has taken training and occasional medication. Pearl is afraid of crates! They cause  her to panic, and she has injured herself trying to escape them. Should visitors come, Pearl would prefer a hiding spot where she can fly under the radar. \n\nPearl\u2019s wish list goes something like this:\n\u2022\tQuiet adult home without kids, teens, and cats\n\u2022\tLow-energy dog companion (no hyper pups or dog parks please!)\n\u2022\tCalm and peaceful home with a comfy spot of her own\n\u2022\tLots of snuggles and sweet talk \n\nIf you want a lovable dog with a face you can\u2019t resist and also have a calm and structured home, please email ARK friend Joy at Broken Tails Rescue but be sure to tell her that ARK sent you! joychambers@gmail.com  #ARKforPearl\n \n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST ~ PLZ DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~\n \n\n\n\n",

            "description": "If interested in adopting Simon please go to our website www.jcldr.com and fill out an adopt application online. We will then contact you. No one is obligated to adopt by filling out the adopt app but it gets us acquainted with you and your life style and expectations to see if he might be a match. \n\nSimon is an excessive White neutered Catahoula Male, about two years old. Vision and hearing impaired. He does have eccentric pupils. We would say his vision is not crisp, probably his peripheral vision is not very good, has to see right in front of him. Special needs. He can hear dogs bark, he responds to deep tones not high pitched tones. (Admin Note; This is not uncommon with excessive white dogs) Weighs about 63 pounds. He loves the water definitely. He is leash puller, as most Catahoulas are when focused. He has to know the vet and get comfortable with them and then he is easier to handle at the vets.  He settles down. He cannot be manhandled. He is up to date on vaccs, HW tested and HW negative as of January. He rides well in the car like a gentleman. He is an average vocal dog. (Admin note: dogs with hearing deficit usually like the vibration of their own voice but he is not an excessive constant barker) Nail trims and baths are fine and he will let the foster do it herself, he is very good for grooming. He is very easy to handle once he is comfortable in the environment. He adores kids, even interacts with the 3 year old and can\u2019t get enough. We still would want supervision and also respectful children in his world. He loves the foster\u2019s cat but they don\u2019t like him back. He plays Catahoula rough with them and they don\u2019t like him. He is fine with foster\u2019s dogs, but in the outside world and he is unfamiliar in the surroundings that he is dog reactive. Foster has terriers and lab mixes, both male and female in his own environment after SLOW and proper introductions. He is wanting to play with small dogs but is definitely too rough and they don\u2019t like him either the same as the cats. We recommend a female dog that isn\u2019t horribly dominant and bossy, which likes to play rough would be a good fit for him. He is not over protective in the home and actually very friendly to strangers coming and going in the home. He is uneasy about people in public.  He feels safer in the home and he would just as soon stay there. It has to do with contrast and bright lights and his vision. He has been good on hiking trails where there is little to no human and dog traffic. This dog should be ON LEASH AT ALL TIME due to his hearing and vision deficit for his safety and others. He is fed twice a day.  He is crate trained. He may fuss a bit at times, but he responds to the \u201cHarrison Ford point\u201d and settles right down.  It must be an airline approved crate with room in it for him to move around since he is large, His crate now is 48 inches. No open wire crates, he escapes and that is not uncommon for many and most dogs. They can and will. Long distance transport can be discussed.  \n\nHISTORY: The end of 2018 someone found him as a stray a couple of counties over in hunting territory. They could not keep him and the foster met him late at night and to keep him from going to a shelter, she took him. She took care of all his vetting and it was clear that he had separation anxiety. Work was done through meds and training, he did improve and he was kept on the meds for his adoption when that family took him off, probably cold turkey, no weaning. He is on Prozac now and he is doing fine as well. It has to be monitored for side effects which can often be behavior issues though none show up today. He was adopted out in April 2019 to a family that had six other dogs so he was to have exercise and play all the time. Active family. He ended up getting kicked out of day care, because he played rough in overstimulation and that often is misread by dogs and humans. They said they were returning him due to reactions in camp grounds to strangers but foster found out that the family was tense and there was a family break up and they split dogs up. \n\nGOOD: He is sweet and friendly in the home, generally in the house, housebroken but when he came back from the adopters home he had problem with urinating and it was mostly due to learned day care behavior. That stopped right away with a little work. Easily is re-directed for the most part. He loves toys and he tries to play fetch but has a hard time finding it if he doesn\u2019t see where it lands. He loves the flirt and it doesn\u2019t affect his prey drive as it does some dogs.  Not a digger, but he might follow suit with another dog instigating. He is not a fence crawler or jumper now, but he was at first he was. It was a wood fence 6 foot. He just tried to climb up and out, not jump actually. Easy dog overall and he loves to cuddle, but can be an awkward bed partner with his legs and feet. Nothing bad, just a big goof. He has no control over his limbs. He still thinks he is a puppy. \n\nBAD: Might mark in a new home until he gets used to it but that is not uncommon in change with any male dog. His overstimulation with dogs and strangers in public can really be strong so he must be removed into a quieter setting but it depends on how much invade his space. He has gotten a lot better and may never be 100%. He does counter surf if food is left in the open, like many Catahoula\u2019s. To him it is a high end game if it is on the counter. He steals anything if he gets bored. One day he stole a bar of soap.  He steals kid\u2019s toys and he will run around and play with them but he does chew them but does definitely try to ingest it internally. So things must be watched and picked up or he could be at risk for a bowel blockage. He cannot have bedding in his crate as it is risky. Foster hasn\u2019t tried except once. Leash pulling.  \n\nUGLY: Worst thing is the out and about reactivity, he needs more work but has gotten so much better with proper training and management. He will do a sit and trust leash handler. He is obnoxious towards other dogs in a Catahoula way and so he has to be separated when he pushes too long and too hard and given a time out. \n",

            "description": "Hi Everyone! I'm U'ilani.  I know what you are thinking...that might be a tough name to remember. But it is unique and that is a good thing! It means Hawaiian heavenly beauty, and if you decide to meet me you will undoubtedly find that I am as beautiful on the inside as I am on the outside.\n\nSince you are here, looking at my bio, I guess it is safe to assume you are considering adding a dog to your family.  So let me tell you a little something about myself to see if we might be a match for each other.\n\nA proper female usually wouldn't tell a stranger her weight, but I'll tell you since you won't tell anyone else.  You see I'm pretty tiny at just 45 pounds which makes me a great size (not to big, not to small).   And to be honest, it makes me a great size to curl up on your lap!\n\nI am so lucky that I landed an awesome foster home and my foster mom said I am the most amazing girl ever!  I am housebroken, although I'll admit that it took a few days for me to get used to the routine, but now no accidents at all!  I'm sure that is in part because I get a treat every time I go potty outside.  I am told that my eyes get wide and I snort just a little when I get treats, but I'm not sure I believe it.  I am a proper lady after all.  \n\nAnd low maintenance?  You betcha!   At about 7 years old I am relatively low energy which would make me a fit for almost any lifestyle.  While I love to go for walks I would be just as happy playing in a fenced yard to get my exercise.\n\nAnd car rides?  Well I just LOVE them!  My foster mom actually hooks up my seat belt and we are on our way.  And I am equally happy curling up on the back seat as I am hanging my head out the window.  Either way it is a win win for me!\n\nI must be pretty special because when my family goes out I don't need to be crated.  I just hang out and relax, keeping an eye on the place while they are gone.  And at night I get to sleep in the oversized chair in the living room.  I'm only allowed on the loveseat if someone is in the den and I totally respect the house rules.  But to be honest I can't wait for someone to sit with me because my very favorite thing in the whole wide world is to cuddle!  I absolutely LOVE to be right next to my people.  I would certainly do a good job keeping your feet warm while we hang out this winter watching Netflix!\n\nI don't have any interest playing with toys so you won't spend a lot of money on things to entertain me.  To be honest, I would just be content with your love and attention.  I would do best in a home as the only dog.  I'm not rude or obnoxious while walking and passing other dogs, I just prefer to be the only canine in the house.  A home with out kitties would also be best as I can get a little to focused on little fuzzy creatures.  \n\nWell that pretty much sums me up.  Absolute sweet heart cuddle bug who would love to share the couch with you!  So if you think that you and I might be a match, don't hesitate to fill out an application to adopt!  You will be happy you did.",

I had a sore on my neck, possibly from a collar that was too small for me, that really needed to be looked at by the doctor. From the Heart made my appointment and got me all fixed up! I'm feeling much better and I'm ready for adoption! I'm good with other dogs and like to relax with the sun on my face. Fill out an adoption application to meet me! Learn more about me and fill out an online adoption application on the From the Heart Rescue website at: www.fthar.org.\n\nMy requested adoption donation includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations and medical care to date, microchip implantation and registration, collar, leash, ID tag, health check-up and one month of free pet health insurance (some restrictions may apply).\n\nIf Im not exactly what you want, please visit my other friends in rescue at From The Heart Rescue on our website at www.fthar.org.",

She is spayed, utd on all medical care and is in good overall health with no concerns.\n\nBehaviorally, Luna is a sweet and friendly girl. She has had a rough life and has experienced a lot of hard times, and she thrives in environments that are calm and relaxing.  Knowing this, we know Luna would do best without children or other pets to allow her to have complete trust and comfort in her forever home. Luna is fully crate trained, house trained, and she knows her commands well. She loves to play with her toys and balls and she prefers when people don't take them away. Luna does well on leash but she prefers to not run into other dogs on her journeys, so she would do best with a nice back yard to exercise and run. Luna has seen some of the worst parts of life in her young years, but has plenty of time left to turn it around and have her happy ending. Luna needs her forever home!\n\nApply for Luna at the link below!",

            "description": "I'm as pretty as a flower and as sweet as a bowl of ice cream! I am a 65 lb , 4-5 yr old chubby hound mix and my coat has the most beautiful markings. I am the best family gal in the world. I love kids, love to cuddle on the couch or chair with my family. I had my own person all my life until they passed away, and then ended up in a shelter. I was not happy there at all... Thats when the nice people at BBRH rescued me! One of my favorite things to do is snuggle up close to you and roll around to get belly rubs. It has been determined that I live my best life if I am an only dog in the house. I just dont love others doggies as much as I love my humans. Cat mesmorize me so I need to stay away from those too, I just cant settle with a kitty around! I am a good listener and will follow you from room to room. I love to feel part of a family and want to protect you.\n\nOn a leash I can pull and bark at other doggos so need continued work on this, as I love going on walks. I have never had an accident in the house and will go to the door when I need to go out. If you are not paying attention and I really need to go, I will paw at you. I love car rides, cool floors, watching TV, and couches.\n\nWhen my foster parents leave, I get a little anxious in a kennel and do not love to be in one, so they leave me out in the house and I am just fine. After barking for a bit I calm down quickly. When you get home I talk to you and tell you how much I missed you, and show you my toothy grin, dance around and tell you how much I missed you! Cutest thing ever. All around I am the greatest dog ever is what my foster family says.\n\nI am 4-5 years old, up to date on all my shots, microchipped and free of heartworms. Are you my new forever family? I would love a home, with a fenced in yard and I guarantee many kisses in exchange for belly rubs! I am being fostered in Sioux Falls SD. Applications can be filled out at bassetandbeagle.org , Adoption fee $250 .",

            "description": "Bobby was rescued from the Downey Shelter where he was so scared and fearful, the shelter said he was not available for public adoption due to being unsocial, but poor Bobby was just very misunderstood. Bobby needs an adopter who is an experienced dog owner and must live in the Temecula/Wildomar/Murrieta/Lake Elsinore area because Bobby's adoption comes with 4-6 weeks of specialized training for the adopter. Bobby was never handled or cared for by a person before, so he needs strict guidance on who is alpha and he needs rules and boundaries or he gets confused. I tried for a year to work with Bobby, but it wasn't until he went to a specialized trainer/handler for 10 days that he truly flourished. He is a completely different dog now and it was because I was doing everything wrong! Bobby weighs about 12 pounds and is approximately 4-5 years old. He is sweet and loves his belly rubs. He loves his toys and walks and is housetrained. He crates perfectly. He likes both men and women equally. Bobby needs to be an only dog or with another dog who is NOT an alpha (he likes to play with other dogs, but is very fearful of larger alpha dogs)and we do not want Bobby to be adopted into a family with children or who will have younger grandchildren coming around (although he seems to love children, they might grab at him or hurt him and he will nip in fright). Bobby is very loyal, loves the outside and is a beautiful little dog that deserves a second chance at a happy life. For more information, please call (951) 678-7497 or fill out an application at GreenDogFoundation.org and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you for looking to adopt!\n\n1/16/21 9:20 PM",

She is very sweet and affectionate, and she loves to be around her people, however her forever family cannot have children under the age of 12 years old. Harlee Quinn is an alpha female. She gets along with submissive dogs with proper introductions. She will need an experienced Dane owner with a structured home environment. She is fully vetted, vaccinated, spayed and microchipped.\n\nWe will require Harlee Quinn to be in training within 15 days of adoption. Obedience training will be a good opportunity for Harlee Quinn to bond with her adopter, while reinforcing commands and good manners and behaviors. This training is crucial in helping her succeed and be the gentle giant she truly is. \n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt",

            "description": "Birdman was seized in an animal cruelty investigation. He was one of the worst cases of animal abuse and cruelty that we've ever seen. He had many open wounds all over his body, had sustained some kind of burns, had scars and we even found a bullet in his head! He was absolutely terrified of everything. It has been 6 months since we rescued him, and his physical wounds have healed but not all of his hair will grow back over them. He wags his tail and is definitely more comfortable around everyone that he knows. He absolutely loves being with other dogs and will start playing with them right away.(Check out his video!)  His spirits are good and we are amazed at his incredible recovery. He is such a sweet boy but still a little nervous around people he doesn't know well, especially men. He is terrified of them and once jumped our fence when he saw one! Therefore, he will also need a very tall and secure fence. Birdman would do best in a quiet home and  he really needs to have a routine.  \n\nHis date of birth is 2/24/2017 and he weighs about 71 pounds. \n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this handsome boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Birdman.",

Scared, alone, and hungry, she made it to a home where people fed her, gave her a bed, and reached out to us for help. \nObviously we feel strongly she was a bait dog at one time.. Surprisingly with slow intros to large dogs she is okay.   She does go into protection mode quickly though.\nShe is very sweet to humans.  Loves attention and so deserves a special place to call home\nThe on line application for her adoption is below. Please note, we do the following\n1. on line application\n2. vet and reference check\n3. phone call\n4. home visit\n5 meet and greet\n6. adoption\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again. No more hurt or fear.\n\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nFOSTER UPDATE JANUARY 3, 2021\n\nShe's a wonderful dog, with a ton of personality, and she will make a great companion.\nShe runs in the fenced yard when she's chasing a squirrel up the tree, and she trots quickly in the house if she hears someone call her, but she doesn't run or get rowdy in the house.\nShe knows the furniture she's allowed to get on. She will put her head under my hand until I pet her. Her favorite type of toy is a stuffed squeaky toy. She doesn't tear them up; she just carries them around, and plays with them by herself. She will also hold a ball in her mouth, but she doesn't like fetch. She's never torn anything up, and she hasn't taken anything that didn't belong to her since those early days. She loves to eat and is always hungry. She loves broccoli stems! She's food motivated and smart, so it is easy to teach her new tricks. She seems so sweet and gentle that you don't imagine she will steal food, but she's not so innocent that you can turn your back on her.\nShe is a pretty good leash walker. She doesn't pull much; in fact, she tends to want to go slower than we do. When she sees a squirrel, she stalks it, until we get close. I have to tell her, \"no\" and break her concentration or she will jerk at the leash trying to chase it.\nShe is well trained and will sit to be petted or for a treat. When she's thinking of jumping on you, if you put your hand out she will stop and sit in front of you. She comes when you call her. As far as other dogs go, she likes people better and would be best as the only dog.\nYou've seen videos of dogs who are wracked with guilt after they do something wrong, and Mama Tig is like that, hanging her head when she has done something wrong.\nShe knows when we are going out and makes herself scarce so we won't put her in her crate (although she lounges in it all day long). Finally we tell her, \"Yes, Mama Tig, you have to go in the crate.\" And she looks up at us, sighs heavily and walks toward it. She'll look back at us with her most sweet expression, like, really? I have to?\nMama Tig will make a great companion, staying by your side as long as you want her there, and then just a smidge longer. She's friendly, happy, loving and loyal. You will not regret letting her into your life.============================================\n\nMama Tig has been in our foster home for a couple of months now, and she is very happy to get attention from anyone in the house. She is the official greeter of the teenagers when they wander out of their rooms. 'I love this dog!' my son says, 'She's always happy to see me.'\nMama Tig has two main expressions; Please, please pet me! and Oh, wow, they're petting me! This is heaven!!\nShe takes correction well, and has learned to leave the trash alone and stay away from the possum holes under the fence.\nMy daughter is taking online classes, and Mama Tig is there in the WebEx screen, making sure she gets plenty of attention, but unobtrusive enough that she doesn't get shooed out of the room.\nMama Tig is having more bursts of energy than she did when we first started fostering her. She will sprint across the backyard in sheer joy, then come running back to me, smiling and excited. She's been well trained to sit and wait for attention, and even when she's excited, a quick hand motion will remind her of her manners. She is still calm and mellow most of the time, and doesn't run or get rowdy inside the house.\nWe think Mama would be best as only dog since we have not been able to find a suitable match Foster Home Update: We really love Mama Tig. She became attached to us so quickly, and she just seems to be ready to love and be loved. She walks up to you and sits politely at your feet and turns her face up to you. You cannot resist petting her. She's just a lovely cuddlebug. She is an escape artist! Her new parents are going to have to be very careful at the front door when entering or exiting!\n\nMama Tig is fully housetrained. I take her out regularly, but if she ever needs to go out, she will let us know by whining at the door. She loves toys, especially squeaky rubber toys. She's extremely gentle with everything she does, and she will kiss your face if you let her. She also knows what she's doing wrong when you tell her no, such as going into a room she's not allowed, and she comes when called.\nWe've had Mama Tig in our house for a bit now, and we've been able to see more of her personality. She's very loving, mellow, gentle. She melts like a puddle, slipping down to the floor, when you pet her in an especially good spot, and she teenage daughter's hugs. In the house, she's calm, docile, and accommodating, right there if you want to snuggle and watch tv, but just as content alone in her dog bed. Occasionally, she gets in a playful mood and carries around one of her squeaky toys, tossing it and squeaking it with her mouth. She'll chase it a couple of times if you squeak it and throw it, but she's not completely sold on the idea of giving her toy back and would just as soon keep it and squeak it herself!\nShe's a good leash walker, and loves heading out the front door, but she's not the dog for someone who wants to take long walks. She's ready to head home after a block or two. She pulls a little bit when we pass another dog or a squirrel, and she chases squirrels up the trees in the backyard.\nMama Tig is loving and gentle, calm and easy, with just enough personality to make you laugh or marvel at her, but not so much that you've got messes to clean! Her main personality is mellow, but she does get excited-about toys, walks, and charmingly, she gets excited at every reunion with someone, even if it's just that she's been in the other room for a couple of hours. Seeing her smiling face and wagging tail greet you when you get back after hours or a 30 second walk to the mailbox is delightful. She will add so much love to her forever family. Come and meet her, maybe it will be you\n----------------\nMama Tig is currently heartworm positive, but please do not let that shy you away from this wonderful dog! Pet Rescue By Judy practices the slow kill method for treating heartworm, and we have had great success with it. The slow kill method means we give the infected dog a medication for 30 days (if you adopt within his first 30 days we will provide you with the medication) and then after that all she needs is her monthly heartworm preventative medication.",

Chevy takes time to trust but once he does he is a very loyal companion. Chevy is in need of an experienced dog owner. He would do best in a low traffic home that is active. He requires a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. He needs someone with large dog experience and patience to understand he needs some time. He loves to snuggle up with you and is very eager to please espe if you have some treats on you!! He absolutely hates hoses! So hide them or you'll regret it ?\n\nHe is fully vetted, housebroken and crate trained. Chevy would do best in a home with older or no children as he takes time to trust and needs low traffic. He can be dog selective but would prefer to not share his home with another dog, he wants to be the king of his castle. He has been good with cats in the past but does chase one of the current cats at his foster. Dog savvy cats would be best. Once he opens up to his human, you'll have a forever companion.",

            "description": "Summer is available for adoption or foster. Summer is currently being fostered in Bradenton, FL (Manatee County). Summer is a sweet senior lab mix who found herself in the shelter when her owner passed. She is low energy, gets along with other dogs, but would do fine by herself. She likes to go for walks, will chase a ball, but mostly likes to stay by your side. She would be a great dog for a senior couple or someone who just wants a loving companion to have around. Summer is a big girl she weighs in at 65 pounds. She listens well, knows basic commands, and is housetrained and crate trained. Summer is looking for that person who will take her to the beach for short walks to sit and watch the sunset, or go for short hikes in the woods. She walks great on a leash and loves to ride in the car. She is an independent girlie, and wants to be petted when she wants it. Does not like to be groomed. She is an old soul who enjoys the simple comforts of life as we all should. Anyone out there for this sweet girl? As a senior, Summer's standard adoption donation is $250, but $150 for a senior adopter 65+ through our Seniors for Seniors program. She is spayed, on preventives, microchipped and heartworm negative. All information about the rescue and adoption can be found at: ewenityfarmsbch.com 2/2/21 5:36 PM",

He came into rescue as an owner surrender, when his owner (an elderly woman) found him too much for her to handle. \n\nHe would do well with a fenced yard and another dog to play with. He does not do well with children. He gets along okay with other dogs, and his previous owner says he's okay with cats, but we haven't tested that.\n\nHe is about 3 and a half years old. He is fully vetted, and is looking for his forever home. His adoption fee is $250, he is located in St. Louis. If you are interested in learning more, meeting and/or adopting Cooper, please complete an application and we'll reach out to you if approved.\n\nhttp://www.mominpinrescue.org/p/adoption-application_30.html",

Sweetie will want to be where you are ... or where the food is.  Sweetie is a great dog but very jealous of other dogs.  Therefore, she should be the only pet in the household.

He can eat, drink and even still plays tug-o-war.\n\nThis handsome dude is a Rockstar with his obedience; sit, down, place command, impulse control and leash manners are on point. Presley loves to treadmill, hike and he also loves to cuddle and watch Netflix. \nPresley is extremely intelligent, he has an outstanding, loyal, silly personality and he will make you laugh. Presley\u2019s best match would be; Pitty or bully type owner experience and someone that enjoys training that will keep Presley working, challenged and consistent with his training is preferred. \n\nPresley may do well with another dog his size, female preferred but that would also depend on the other dogs energy. We\u2019d have to do a dog intro, or Presley would do excellent as the only dog. Also, Presley is no with kitties.\n\nThis boy's adoption fee is $350. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, has had professional training by JD\u2019s Powerhouse K9 Bootcamp and comes with paid follow up training and on-going group classes for him and his new human.",

She was in fact pregnant when turned in at County and her litter aborted before we acquired her :(\nHer teeth have been wore down to nubs in the back and completely gone in the front. Possibly due to being chained and chewing at the chains (Something we've seen in a lot of \"breeding\" dogs) But she has no issues eating dry food, drinking water or playing with chew toys.\n\nShe is NOTHING but kisses and kisses and the most loving girl. She likes all people, kids (though we suggest older kids and/or a calm household) and seems to like dogs her size (No small dogs). \n\nIf interested, please tell us about your living circumstances; house/apt, kids/pets in the home, work hours, etc... so we can determine if Reba is the best match for you!",

            "description": "Anthony is a one-of-a-kind - He's definitely unique-looking! His personality is just as bold as his looks, and this will require someone patient and experienced. \n\nAnthony arrived at the HSEP from the city shelter at Animal Services with an unknown history since his owner failed to reclaim him. As Anthony spent more time here at the shelter, our staff noticed he was not acclimating well to all the noise and stress that comes with living in a shelter, and he also had what some might call \"\"stranger danger\"\" - He was hesitant to trust new people in his life, and so he displayed undesirable behavior in an effort to feel safe, which is a complete 180 from the lovable goofball that all the Animal Care Associates know and love. We found that Anthony was treat motivated, but he won't accept treats from people that are either lacking confidence or impatient and just want to start playing with him without yet earning his trust. So how do you get to be one of the people he loves? Ask an Animal Care Associate to meet with him, and they'll utilize one of our quieter rooms so Anthony can just focus on learning about you. Don't forget the treats!\n\nAnthony Davis isn't a fan of cats or smaller pets, but he seems to be able to coexist with dogs his size as long as they have doggie manners and aren't overwhelming. To ensure compatibility, a Meet + Greet with any dogs you have at home is required prior to adoption. \n\nAnthony knows the command \"\"sit\"\", and is also housetrained! He's working on learning to love his crate, and positive reinforcement will go a long way. This means using all the things he loves (such as meals and toys) to get him to willingly go inside his crate because after all, that should be his safe lounging place. \n\nIf you've got a patient heart with plenty of love to give to a dog that needs a second chance, ask an Animal Care Associate to meet Anthony!\nHappiness Happens at the Humane Society of El Paso!",

I can navigate quite nicely in my cart, I love car rides and swimming would be great exercise for me. I adore people and get along great with other dogs. I have never met a cat but I am willing to be introduced.\n\nI am paralyzed in my rear end and require the use of a cart for mobility. I also need my bladder expressed.\n\nI may require some extra care but you will discover that I am worth it. Just look into my soft brown eyes and let me give you my best kisses and you will agree!\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

After a month at CCHS, Latte is still timid, especially with strangers and was reluctant to get too far from the building or even the kennel assistant, all of whom she's used to now. Even with her uncertainty about people, Latte's sweetness, loyalty and soulfulness are clearly recognizable. She is a true jewel. Latte's loving glances and the way she likes to touch and hug are poignant. She has a pleasant, calm, soothing demeanor, but will need time, patience and understanding as she works through establishing a level of trust that's truly reassuring. Latte's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover the costs of her spay, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

            "description": "DAISY was found on one of the reservations we work with along with her sister (who hears) and her brother (who is also blue-eyed and deaf). She is very sweet, lots of waggy tails, happy, playful and lots of kisses :-). \n\nShe identifies you by smelling you and once she recognizes you, lavishes you with kisses :-) She has a comical nature as you can see from the pictures :-)   You will need to have another friendly playful young dog - puppies need to play and a deaf dog needs a best friend to be her ears. If you don't have another dog, Daisy has two best friends in foster that she plays with daily-- Foley and Ollie.\n\n A great site with tips on having a deaf dog family member is DeafDogsRock.com and there's quite a bit of DDSL on there as well. There are also a few books on Amazon about deaf dogs as family members. \n\n Daisy has play dates with other dogs daily and has a great time! She's also been fostered with cats.  Daisy is deaf and has trouble seeing when she comes inside from a strong sun (her eyes are very pale blue :-) \n\nHer adoption fee includes her spay, vaccines, deworming, tick/flea prevention, and microchip. Her birthday is January 30, 2020.   \n\nImportant:\nDo you live in our adopting area? Do you have another young playful friendly male dog? If yes to both questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nWe're sorry, but if you email us or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. First, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application. (Please do not call or text). We are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal(s). If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. If your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. Since we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you to send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. We will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we) and have hand sanitizer.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Puppies MUST adopt to families that have another young friendly playful dog of similar size when grown. These animals are fostered and our families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (social media, pics, holiday card, videos  etc :-)\n\nThank you!",

Through many vet appointments, we have been able to determine underlying medical conditions that are being managed with daily medications and a special diet. Because of this, we do consider Meg to be Special Needs and will require medication and a special diet the rest of her life. We would be happy to discuss Megan's medical needs.\n\nDespite her medical conditions, Meg is a sweet, bright Corgi girl. True to the Corgi breed, she is intelligent, easy to train, and eager to please. She is active in her backyard, chasing the birds, squirrels and running the fence with the neighbor dog. She has no issues with steps or getting up on the sofa to snuggle. She enjoys daily short walks, playing fetch and tug of war with her toys. She is quiet in the house, unless she is ready for a romp in the yard outside. She can be anxious in new situations, and prefers some personal space with the other older dogs in the house. She would probably be best as an only dog or paired with one laid back dog that would give her some space. She is also fine with the cats in the home. She is crate-trained and house-trained, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm preventative. Megan is 8 years old.\n\nPlease read our website information at www.petssecondchance.org before calling about Meg. We require a fenced yard and no small children. Contact claireelizabeth@petssecondchance.org for more information or to inquire about adoption.\n",

We don't do our adoptions on first come first serve basis, we instead focus on matchmaking to ensure the perfect match for both the animal and adopter.\n\nDOB: 6/6/2014\nBreed: Staffordshire Terrier Mix\nSpayed Female\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nA little bit about me...\n\nHello friends! In case we haven't met before, allow me to introduce myself...I'm Helga, and I have been here at the shelter for over two years now. Why am I still here you ask? Most people assume that I mustn't be a nice dog because I bark in my kennel; and even though the other dogs bark in their kennels, they get adopted. If you were in a kennel with people walking past you all day, wouldn't you bark as well? I'm staying positive though because I am looking for someone who understands that I am not a mean dog, but rather a very sweet loving girl who LOVES every single person I meet.\n\nThe highlights...\n\nBreed experience preferred\nI am addicted to playing frisbee & ball\nI love belly rubs and snuggles!\nI can go home with mature, older kids\nI have a lot of love to give so I'd prefer to be an only dog\nI am a restricted breed, so you must own your home.\n\nMy ideal home would include...\n\nA family that understands that while I may be an adult, I still need to get used to a new environment and learn when and where I am expected to go potty. I will need to adjust to a whole new routine, and you will need to learn my signs for letting you know I have to go outside to potty.\n\nSomeone who will provide me daily walks, a lot of love, and most importantly, treats. I'm a really smart girl and I already know how to sit, lie down, drop it, shake, leave it, stay, as well as other commands. I will need the most help with adapting to a home environment as I've become accustomed to living in a shelter.\n\nSomeone who is looking for an amazing dog to accompany them on walks and play fetch with. I enjoy being the center of attention, and I love an audience (and round of applause) when I'm catching frisbees. After a tiring game of fetch I would love to snuggle with you and take a nap!",

She is crate trained, house broken, walks well on a leash, sits, waits and when you ask her to do something she looks you sincerely in the eyes and waits for the next command. Although she plays rough with other dogs there is never any malice behind it. She is respectful of older dogs and seems uninterested in the cats. She is a bit of a magnet and loves to be right by your side staring up at you in a loving and sometimes creepy way. This does not mean separation anxiety. She is a truly beautiful dog inside and out.\nAdoption Donation $700\nCall Kim at 425-888-9322\nPlease do not email",

Ester is\nnow safe with us and even spent some time with a trainer doing a 2-week board and train. She did amazing!\n\nEster is learning people are good, we don't blame her for being apprehensive after what she recently went through. Ester loves to play ball! She is house trained, is working on confidence and is really a sweet girl. Ester will be looking for a home that will continue with her training and confidence building.\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org Ester is located in Southern California.",

She plays with toys, loves belly rubs and in truth has taught us to accept her just the way she is.\n\nAdoption Donation $400 \nCall Kim at 425-888-9322\nPlease do not email.",

We have human foster siblings, and they are very important to us so we can sometimes be protective of them so we we'd like to have older ones. We know it's good to be healthy and love to snack on apples. My brother Kermit, gets VERY excited when we get treats. Sometimes too excited so my foster mom just tosses him treats and he catches them. He's so silly! I could use a little more patience on the leash, but I know we'll find someone to help me with treat taking and him with walking on the leash.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Anubis! I am calm, sweet, stocky boy looking to cuddle with my humans and relax in the sun. I am originally from Texas but traveled up north when hurricanes hit in Houston. My favorite hobbies include testing out squeaky toys, playing tug, and watching the bunny rabbits in the backyard. I'm also well mannered in the home and can be trusted left loose when you are at work! I'll also wait until you tell me it's okay for me to join you on the couch for snuggles - that's just how polite I am! Different records have indicated varying ages for me, but I am definitely older than 5 and have the energy of a middle-aged dog.\n\nI do have some fears, big live stock puts me on edge, other dogs make me feel like I need to protect my humans, and little humans make a bit too many fast moves for me to handle in my old age. When I see other dogs out and about, I do react but my foster mom says I am making steady progress with my training and it's a good thing I only need 1-2 short walks a day. I am excellent with kids 5 and up! I am gentle and loving and I adore them.\n\nI am currently on some allergy medication to help get my skin and ears nice and healthy again. Because some allergies require long term management with medication, my meds may need continued on a chronic level, but my foster mom says I don't mind taking them!\n\nI'd love a home where I can be given endless treats and endless love, I will return it ten-fold. I am looking for a foster-to-adopt home, if you are interested please contact Until They're Home or complete the foster/adopt application here\nhttps://form.jotform.com/92587410679166",

What happened with our sweet teddybear .\n\nHe was good before with dogs and suddenly became reactive .\n\nI started to work from zero again on him and he did fine with me . The only problem he still has is that he gets kennel crazy and he shows his anxiety .\n\nAmalto needs a dedicated adopter who has an active lifestyle , who is retired or works from home . It\u2019s clear that he has abandoning issues .\n\nIt broke my heart to see our dog returned like this .\n\nAmalto was good before with dogs but starts to bark now on them . He is not good with cats . Amalto is a medium sized dog but looks bigger in picture\n\nHe is located in Middle Island NY\n\nWe are looking for a person who gains his trust and wants a partner for life .\n\nAmalto loves to be cuddled when he knows you . Is easy on the leash . Knows his basic commends and his house trained .\n\nIf you are the person who wants to give Amalto a new chance in life and give him the life he deserves then please apply by filling in the adoption  link to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one",

We estimate that Isabella was born in approximately 2015. Pretty Isabella has come such a long way but yet, is still searching for her forever home.\n\nIsabella loves to sleep in and adores her toys. She is fantastic with people and would love a home with a fenced yard to play in! City life does not appeal to Isabella - she's a country girl at heart! A cute little country bandanna around her neck and some grass, and she will be right at home!\n\nIsabella would do best in a home that does not have cats. She could be a single dog, or would be okay with a non-alpha dog with a slow introduction. Isabella is spayed and is crate trained.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Isabella, please put your application in here:\n\nhttp://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

My ideal adopter would be one who knows a lot about my breed. I would do best with larger kids as I am also a large gal. I need to be the only dog as I just love my people soo much. I have not been tested with cats. My ideal home would be one with a yard that has space for me to run and play. Please call our Dog Adoption Center for more Information! 530-343-7917 X201.",

Mac came to Illinois Humane from local animal control, when he partially tore the left hind leg cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) and needed corrective surgery.  The leg is now in good shape.  Mac has a great pitty smile full of that long tongue,   He listens and minds well, and already knows some training tricks that help manage his young dog energy.  He is sensitive, and attentive; he responds well to commands and he responds to his name.  There are two caveats with Mac.  First, important behaviorally, Mac tends toward separation anxiety.  Mac has had to move around too much in his young life, and is not happy to see his humans leave him.  Second, Mac, as it goes with these cases, if they tear one cruciate ligament, there is a chance the other hind leg may have issues down the road.  Just something to keep in mind !",

I'm a great dog for someone that is active.. likes to run, bike  or hike and needs a 4 legged companion to accompany them. I'm fine with other dogs but I am a bit pushy so another large dog with similar energy would be great to be with. I would be best with older kids ages 12 yrs+ as I'm a bit strong for young kids. I've never met a cat yet so best if I went to a cat free home. Sadly I've been in a kennel for far too long and have been over looked because I'm brindle in color. I'm looking for someone who knows, understands and appreciates my breed and wants a partner in outdoor activity.. It would be great to have a fenced in yard for endless fetching sessions! I'm a BRINDLELICIOUS SUPER STAR in the making! Come and meet me today!\n\nFor an application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

The good news is that she is housebroken, has some training, and gets along with most other dogs (although she will bark at other dogs on the other side of the fence). The bad news is that she does have a bite history.  She isn't reliable with strangers and needs very firm boundaries with everyone in the household.  She is affectionate but she becomes overwhelmed easily, especially when anyone's face is too close.  She will need an adult home with absolutely no interactions with kids.  She also needs a quiet place to be if any visitors come over so she (and them) aren't placed in any uncomfortable situations.  Millie is not an evil dog and she has never been a danger to anyone during her time at the rescue but home life is different and we want to see her succeed.  It isn't just about finding A home for Millie, it is about finding the RIGHT home for her.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.TxDot contacted us about a dog that was residing on their campus for over a month. Traci Bell volunteered to capture her. We named her Dottie.\n\nDottie was very lucky because the TxDot employees were taking care of her. They were concerned because they saw her walking on the main road.\n\nWhen Traci caught Dottie, Dottie was not happy. Traci was afraid she would escape the trap. When she got here, she really didn't want anything to do with us.\n\nWithin an hour of being on the ranch, Dottie was learning all about walking on a leash and being loved on. She has taken to Kim Young Pagenkopf. Follows her everywhere. Loves other dogs and is going to be ready for a family within a couple of weeks. She is a great dog. However she is heartworm positive.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Dottie, you can fill out an application at www.adoggie4you.org.\nDottie's adoption fee is $200 and she will be coming with her heartworm meds for a slow treat.",

She enjoys to play tug and run before a nice snuggle on the couch for nap time.\n\nOakley is crate trained, house trained and completely vetted. Due to an injury when she was a puppy, her tail has been amputated and an FHO has been done to her back left leg to give her full use of her leg and eliminate any pain. Absolutely none of this has affected her personality or her love for people!\n&\n\n\nWe are not a shelter, we are a rescue and all of our rescued pets live with a Tennessee foster family until their forever home is found. They are all checked by a veterinarian, current on their vaccinations, spayed/neutered are micro-chipped. Our fosters know the animals best and will give you an honest assessment of their traits and training. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a pet from Saving The Animals Together, please submit an application by clicking on the Adopt tab at www.savingtheanimalstogether.org or email us at statadoptions@savingtheanimalstogether.org \n\n\nAs soon as we receive your application back, we will check your references and then contact you for a telephone interview. At that point the foster will contact you to discuss the pet with you.",

I am full of energy as is true to my breed so please be sure you have enough energy to keep up with me and several swimsuits and flippers. I don't mind cats but I can be a little too playful so perhaps a home without cats would be best because I wouldn't want to hurt them playing. I am very smart and can open doors the lever handled doors are especially easy. So be aware. I never learned to share and can be very protective with my toys and my food. So please feed me separately if there are other animals in the home. I enjoy toys but only for solitary playtime only. I can not be crated as I find them too confining and stressful. \n\nI do NOT like to be touched on my back and hind end, so combining that with my high energy, lack of sharing skills, I must go to an adult only home without children. A confident owner with husky experience is best suited for a successful outcome. \n\nI am looking for that special someone XOXO.",

Medical marijuana patient, drives a Prius #FeelTheBern -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intake Date: 1 June 2020 \u2014\u2014- Age: 3 yrs ----- Breed: lab x great Pyrenees ----- Size: 100 lbs ----- Status: owner surrender ----- Compatible with: dogs, older children. No cats. ----- Suitable for: home with a securely fenced yard. \u2014\u2014- Medical/Behavioral Needs: Needs a firm owner, boundaries, consistency. ----- Additional Notes: This polar bear of a dog came to rescue after being bounced a few times. A foster home took him in as an owner surrender for another rescue, but the rescue closed leaving the foster with a dog that is not a great fit for their household long term. Booser is a fun loving, giant goof ball of a dog, but he does have a few quirks that come along with owning a guarding breed. While generally friendly and excited to meet new people, Booser can be reactive at barriers, such as a fence line or through his kennel, with people he doesn't know. As he has settled in over time, these behaviors have diminished, but it is possible they could resurface in a new home. Once Booser knows you, you are his best friend and he'd love to hang with you. He enjoys going for walks and basking in the yard, watching the world go by. Booser requires a slower introduction with new dogs, as he can get a little overwhelmed at too many coming at him too fast, but once he knows a dog, he is a submissive teddy bear. He also doesn't know just how big of a floof he is, so action around young children. Booser walks okay on a leash. Once in a while, he likes to practice bounding around like the mini pony he is, but he quickly composes himself. Booser is generally quiet in the house and not a barker (as a note, he is currently fostered in a rural area so there also isn't a whole lot going on). Booser deserves a home that will love him for the big, fluffy, shed-everywhere, class clown of a dog that he is. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption is finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175 and all dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are not guaranteed but often a best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A securely fenced yard is mandatory. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

We have no idea how they got there but do feel they were dumped. They would not have been able to get in that situation by themselves. We believe they are related.....either father/daughter or siblings. They were very skinny when found.\n\nEve is doing great now. Both she and Adam have vision impairment but hers is definitely less severe.  She adapts quickly to a new situation and relies heavily on her sense of hearing and smell to familiarize herself to new surroundings. She loves to play with other dogs but does best with bigger dogs. She does not do well with cats. Eve must have a fenced yard and does best with a controlled, predictable environment. Due to her vision issues, she can be a bit reactive to new people so will need a slow, calm introduction. She is not aggressive but does react defensively by barking and backing off a bit when she senses a new voice or smell in her surroundings.  \n\nEve is spayed, HW negative and up to date on shots.

I would like to be the only animal in a family with older children. I\u2019m quite the little guard dog and am very protective of the people I love. Even though I\u2019m about 55-60 pounds, I think I\u2019m a lapdog and enjoy cuddles! \n\nI do not like other dogs and need to be kept away from them, please. I can sit, lie down,stay and my foster family has taught me how to heel. I\u2019m very smart and a quick learner. I love going on daily walks, riding in the car, playing fetch, swimming in shallow water, going out in nature, and chewing durable dog toys. \n\nI\u2019ll need an active family, as I get bored sitting around the house. I also need a fenced in backyard to run around in and would like to live in a house not an apartment. I\u2019m an adorable, sweetheart who would love to have a somewhat active, loving family without other animals. Please adopt me!\n\nIf you would like to adopt Lola please fill out an adoption application on our website. Scooterspals.org\n\nPlease email us instead of calling. \n\nTo expedite the process please fill out an adoption application at https://www.scooterspals.org/\nWe only adopt in Nevada County, Sacramento County and Placer County.\n\n\n\n",

We do not always receive those emails.\n\nEmail us your questions at WSADOPTIONS@WOLFSPIRITSRESCUE.COMYou MUST fill out an application to be considered for adoption. WolfSpiritsRescue.com/info/adoption\n\n07/31/2020 Rain went in for a dental today and is now toothless. No crunchy kibble for this sweetheart. She is a sweet little girl who wants nothing but your love and attention. She is working on her house manners but doing much better. She still has accidents but we blame that on the human who doesn't keep her on a schedule. She walks well on a leash but loves being able to run free in a fenced area. Her foster family feels a home with a fenced yard would be best for her. Rain gets a little preoccupied and doesn't come when called so needs a little training with recall. She is food motivated so getting her attention is pretty easy as long as you have food in your hand.\n\nLocation: NE Ohio\nFence Required: Yes\nHousetrained: No\nObedience Training Needed: Needs Training\nExercise Needs: Moderate\nGrooming Needs: Low\nShedding Amount: Moderate\nOwner Experience Needed: None\nReaction to New People: Friendly\n\nRain is a climber so no doggy doors or short fencing for her. And absolutely no tie outs for this little girl she is just too active and would get hurt. Rain needs to be monitored when she has her time outside. 1/24/21 3:13 PM",

Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

The pair do seem to be bonded but we do think they will do fine separated after some adjustment time. Rosie is a friendly dog with people but has some issues with other dogs at this time. Not knowing her past experience, this is something that we are working on. She does well with Che, her companion rescue. She doesn't appear to want to make friends with cats. Rosie has a limp. One of her shoulders has been injured and e-rays indicate that it is an old and healed injury. We are providing her with suppliments to help. She uses all 4 legs most of the time but just hop jumps from time to time with that tender leg. Micro-Chipped Adoption Fee: $150",

            "description": "Vincent arrived at Horse Creek Wildlife on May 13, 2020.  He is a handsome boy with a heart of gold.  We believe he is possibly a Catahoula Leopard Dog/Boxer mix.\n\nHe is extremely sweet and loving.  He never meets a stranger and believes everyone should love him instantly!  He enjoys playing in the exercise areas with other dogs, and he loves spending time with people and going for long walks along our walking trail.\n\nVincent will make an awesome addition to the family that promises to love and care for him always!  Could that family be yours?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

I love toys, especially the squeaky kind.  I 'm not a yapper, but I do bark from time to time.  I love the outdoors.  There's so much to explore.

You forgot one, FALCO!\n\nSweet girl Falco has been waiting oh so patiently, a member of the Faithful Friends family since June! This girl has all the fun you could possibly ask for. She will happily accompany you on your adventures and fitness walks, and well, if you're looking for one of the most photogenic pups there ever was, you found her! As her stay has gotten longer, her spirit hasn't diminished, but the staff who love her dearly would love nothing more than to see her get into her forever home. This girl is around 3 years old and just over 60 pounds of love and snuggles for her perfect human.\n\nFalco will need a human who is dedicated to working with the trainers and her to help her continue learning all her best home manners, as she's been without one for so long now! Falco would thrive in a low key home where her human is all her own, so if you're looking for a dedicated canine companion, look no further!\n\nThink you could be the perfect best friend for sweet Falco? Please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.cognitoforms.com/FFAS1/DogAdoptionApplication\n& a member of the dog adoption team will be in touch!",

Email his caretaker at lucasapwieser@gmail.com to inquire about adopting or for more information. He is located in New Orleans.\n \nInformation from caretaker:\nHank is a super loving boy who would do best in a home with lots of space to run and play. He loves all toys and playing fetch and tug-o-war. He is high energy and loves all the walks/jogs he can get but also loves to snuggle up on the couch to watch TV. He is very obedient about certain things - he will run right into his crate when you tell him. He comes, sits, and stays very well. He is not destructive at all and has never chewed something he wasn't supposed to. He has had some issues with food/toy aggressiveness (especially if he has a new bone treat) and would benefit from obedience training. He gets along with some dogs no problem and will run and play for hours, while others he will be aggressive towards right away. Overall Hank is very affectionate and wants to be close to all people he encounters.\n\nHank is super loving towards all people, including children, but if he were chewing a bone and a child approached unexpectedly or from behind he may get aggressive. Dogs are hit or miss whether he will get along. He has lived with a cat before and will chase them but won't get aggressive with them as far as I know.",

LOLLI PUP AND HER TWIN BROTHER MEAT BALL ARE LITTLE WRINKLY ROLLEY POLLEY CHARACTERS THAT ARE SIMPLY ADORABLE. LOLLI BEING THE BIGGER OF THE TWO SHE IS ALL WHITE WITH A BROWNISH/BLUE SPOT OVER HER EYE WHEREAS HER BROTHER IS A MIXTURE OF BLUE & WHITE COLORED FUR THAT LOOKS LIKE A MASSIVE SEA OF WRINKLES THAT NEVER ENDS. SHE IS MORE OF THE CALM LAID BACK SWEETHEART BUT MEAT BALL IS THE MOUTHY DEMANDING CENTER OF ATTENTION TYPE PERSONALTY. DESPITE THEIR RESEMBLANCES AND DIFFERENCES BOTH WILL CONSTANTLY HAVE YOU SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR IN DELIGHT OVER HOW CUTE OR LUCKY YOU ARE TO HAVE SUCH ADORABLE POOCHES! SOCIAL BUTTERFLIES BOTH ARE GENTLE MIDGETS AS WE SAY HERE AT THE RESCUE SINCE THEY ARE SMALL IN STATURE COMPARED TO THEIR SIBLINGS WHO HAVE TALLER LEGS. THUS MEANINGS BOTH WILL REMAIN SMALLER IN SIZE AS THEY REACH ADULTHOOD. PLAYFUL AND CURIOUS THEY WANT TO EXPLORE AND ADVENTURE OUT INTO THE BIGGER WORLD SO THEY CAN INSECT IT ALL. HOWEVER ONLY 3 MONTHS STILL THEY WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED LESSONS OF OBEDIENCE, HOUSEBREAKING AND MORE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GROW INTO HEALTHY CONFIDENT ADULT CANINES AS THEY SHOULD. THIS PAIR DOES NOT HAVE A PREFERENCE TOWARDS MAN OR WOMAN FOR THEIR HUMAN COMPANION AS THEY LOVE EVERYONE THEY ENCOUNTER. GREAT ADDITIONS FOR THE FAMILY HOUSE HOLD AS WELL OR FOR THE INDIVIDUAL/COUPLES LOOKING FOR A PAIR TO CALL THEIR OWN. ADOPTERS WILL NEED TIME AND PATIENCE AS THEY ARE YOUNG IN AGE AND NEED TO BE GUIDED UNTIL THEY ARE COMPLETELY TRAINED OR COMFORTABLE IN THEIR NEW SURROUNDINGS. LIKE ALL PUPPIES THESE TWO CAN BE FULL OF ENERGY AND ACTIVE READY TO GO GO GO OR PLAY AT 3 AM IN THE MORNING HOWEVER THIS DYNAMITE DUO ARE EASY TO BED AS THEY ARE TO RISE SINCE THEY TOO ENJOY DAILY NAPS CUDDLING ON THE COUCH OR BEDS WITH THEIR COMPANIONS. SO IF YOU LIKE THE THOUGHT OF ADOPTING THIS DYNAMIC DUO OR ARE WILLING TO TAKE THIS PAIR INTO YOUR HEARST AS WELL AS YOUR HOME, REST ASSURED THESE TWO FUTURE FAMILY WILL BE REWARDED WITH A LIFETIME OF LOVE, KISSES AND LOYAL COMPANIONSHIP FROM BOTH MEAT BALL AND LOLLI PUP.",

He shows caution upon meeting new people by heavy barking and requires slow introductions with new people. He has made excellent progress working with his trainer, and he will need to continue with his training work in a new adoptive home.\n\nHe is good with other dogs with a slow introduction. Barack also requires a slow introduction with new people. He is not a good dog for a home environment where there are new people in and out frequently.\n\nBarack really wants to please and is such a loving boy. He responds quickly to commands, walks well on a leash, though sometimes needs to be redirected when he gets distracted seeing another dog or people. He loves to greet us with a toy after being away, is not food aggressive and lets you take a bone/toy from him without acting protective. He uses his paws to get a head pat or body rub. What a joy to share time with this handsome tail wiggling boy.\n\nBarack will need to be in a home where he has access to a yard with a secure privacy fence and locked gate, along with daily walkies to maintain his mobility as he ages. He is taking hip/joint supplements for hip arthritis.\n\nCan you help give Barack the home he needs in his golden years? 1/29/21 12:55 PM",

            "description": "Meet Stone. Stone has been at Satchel's for a little over 6 months now. Surrendered to us through Beach Vet by his owners who felt he was just too much for them to handle. It takes a few visits with Stone for him to start to earn your trust but this boy is worth the effort. He's a handsome, strong, energetic, young boy with so much life to live. Stone loves to play fetch with tennis balls, but hasn't quite caught onto the entire game - dropping them for you doesn't currently happen so you need to have several. He loves playing 'catch me if you can in the yard' with you, but he is just learning how to play with people and can get wound up quickly, so it is important to keep some level of calmness until he knows how to calm himself. He likes to go on walks with our volunteers, and walks well on a leash, but is very unsure of everything outside of his immediate environment so won't travel far from the shelter. Stone loves all toys, his favorite being the Kong. He will chew on one all day, even if it's empty. Throws it around his kennel, carries it outside with him and brings it back in. He is starting to show affection as he learns to trust. He will come and sit next to you and will lick your face to say 'thank you for saving me'. Stone is still very scared of most things. This young boy needs encouragement and socialization. If you have the time and patience to give Stone what he needs so he is able to become the best boy he can be and enjoy life to the fullest, please set up an appointment to meet him.

Just no other way to describe her. It may be that she was not handled at all as a puppy, and did not become accustomed to being handled. She greets you by crouching in a low stance and tail tucked.  With time, she warms up and soon begins to wag her tail in greeting. With much love and patience she will grow into a great companion pet.  Age 2 year approximately. \n Weight 37 pounds. \n\nBecause of her nervous nature, we are recommending a home without young, unpredictable children. She walks fairly nice on a leash. Barks at new sights and sounds, but then stops. Enjoys romping in the yard, and you can see her white tipped tail at attention checking fence line. A true hound!  \n\nMicrochipped.  Heartworm negative. Fully vaccinated and on heartworm prevention.\n\nOut of state adoptions are welcome. However, fees are higher due to increased efforts to transport. Adoption fee $100. $150 transport fee for OUTSIDE of Texas  Health certificate $50 for OUTSIDE of Texas",

            "description": "Clef is a truly 'funtastic' dog. He has tons of energy, and loves to play and learn new things. He can be a couch potato at times, but definitely prefers to stay busy! He's a smart pup and has had a ton of training. He knows to 'sit, 'lie down, 'stand, 'back up, 'stay, go to his crate, get his ball, when it's time to 'play' and when it's time for 'din din'. He is eager to learn more of this human language and commands! A typical day with Clef involves several training and game sessions, a walk or two, and him taking naps in between. He loves puzzle toys for when you need to focus on something else, especially if those toys are filled with peanut butter! At the end of the day when he's tired, he'll cuddle with you and ask for belly rubs, and reward you with face licks. If you want him to get excited, just say the word 'play', and he'll dash over to the door with his tail wagging! Clef loves to chase after squirrels and cats, and definitely wishes he had wings so he could chase after birds too. He would thrive in a house without small dogs or other pets. Other dogs would first need to be introduced to him to see if they would be good fits. We don't have much information about how he is with kids, but he has been observed to be nonchalant towards them during walks. He has a habit of dashing out when the door is opened, and needs a home that will make sure to take care that he doesn't get out. Clef would prefer to live in a house with a fenced-in yard, and with people who are home most of the day. He is house-trained and crate-trained, but he's not the type of dog who likes to be left alone for long periods of time because he gets bored and anxious. If you work from home or live with others who do, he would be a great addition to your life! Come meet this energetic boy, he would love to show you how smart he is!",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Mr. Nacho is our longest rescue resident and he has been patiently waiting for his forever home since September 2019. Nacho is a sweet 60 lb male bully breed mix from Kauai. He's about 7 years old, affectionate, and loves to cuddle with his foster family. He's had full obedience training and has excellent leash manners but does require a skilled handler who can provide good leadership. He is currently being fostered with a trainer and his adoption will include two take home lessons. While on leash he can be extremely excitable, but with proper handling he will heel politely by your side. He is crate trained and loves to fetch. Nacho's ideal home will be with a dog-savvy couple or family in a single-family residence outside the city with a securely fenced yard (no apartments), no pets, and no children under the age of 12.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $400, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued and joined us from Kauai Humane Society rescue partner. He will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.\n\nAbout Foster to Adopt Program:\nFosters provide a safe landing spot for dogs transitioning from the shelter environment and help prepare the dogs for adoption. You provide the love and structure, and we take care of everything else! We cover all vet care, and drive the adoption process. Average length of foster is 2-3 weeks. Fosters do get first consideration for adoption, if desired.\n\nApply to foster online at www.doggoneseattle.org/foster-application",

            "description": "Strawberry is approx. 4 year old bull terrier mix.  She weighs just under 40 lbs. She is precious.   She has a great personality.  She is very sweet and is very loving.  She loves to chase balls and play with toys.  She is the typical \"small dog syndrome\" and tends to overreact to smaller dogs when  she first meets them; however, once she gets to know them, she will do fine.  She's not a fan of cats however.  She knows a few commands.  Like most rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

I am a very loyal girl who would be best suited in a calm and quite home with no more than 2 adults and no other pets. My new home should also have owners strong enough to hold me on walks, especially if I get excited and pull. I'm stout but quite strong actually :) \n\nEver wanted your own secret service agent? Zoey's your girl if that's what you like!  We always feel safe with Zoey around! \n\n\n\nApply online at www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInterested in adopting?

Kilo would be happiest as the only pet in the home, as he likes getting ALL of the attention. He's a good boy who keeps his space clean and does not chew his blankets. He likes to chew on Nylabones and he's a good eater. Kilo is neutered, up to date on his vaccines, heartworm tested, & microchipped. Kilo's adoption donation is $175. You can apply for him at www.adoptapitrescue.org\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

            "description": "Tiny Madison was brought to the NYC Animal Care Centers as a stray in April 2020.  She was not cared for as she was emaciated and looked like she wasn't cared for. \n\nHer behavior evaluation came to the conclusion that she was scared, and was acting out, out of fear. Her life was in jeopardy as she was placed on the AT RISK LIST.  \n\nShe soon caught the eye of an awesome couple experienced in behavioral dogs and she was placed with them.\n\nShe has been learning the ropes and is always a work in progress.\n\nShe is approximately 6-7 years old and 40 pounds.  She is good with other dogs as long as they are calm and respectful. She is housebroken, UTD on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.\n\nHere is what his foster dad has to say:\n\n\nWe Love Tiny Madison and she has slowly come out of her shell during her stay with us! We have given her a well structured and balanced home that she will need when being adopted, she is still well into her training and when adopted continue with keeping up with it. She is still learning to value human interaction and direction, she is not food motivated but loves praise rewards. We are two experienced dog trainers that will love to keep in contact and help through the transition of her new home. \n\nTiny Madison is hand shy, leash shy, lacking in confidence, lacks impulse control, very picky eater, can\u2019t walk for long durations because of hips. Will get separation anxiety if no structure is placed within the home. She does have a heart murmur, so she will need to be kept in a calm household\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 1/8/2020\nReason for being in rescue: breeder release/puppy who did not sell\n\nSpecial Needs: David came from a breeder, a puppy who did not sell. He was kennel raised and will need time and patience to learn how to be a pet. David must go to a home with an experienced dog owner. He is not for the first time dog owner. He has behavior quirks that need an experienced dog owner to correct.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nWeight: 46 lb\nHeight: 24 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? David needs an experienced dog owner and someone who is knowledgeable with training, David has some nipping issues. Its only happening when he gets really excited. He could benefit from another large dog being in the house but doesn't have to have one. David needs a home with high exercise and lots of activities to keep him busy. No children under the age of 18 is a must for him at this time. David needs a lot of structure and routine in his life. He needs training and behavior modification. He gets very stressed and will bark until he is comfortable again.\n\nWhat is my personality like? David takes some time to warm up, a little longer than most, but once he does he is very energetic and is ready to play! David does have some small nipping issues especially with hands when he gets to excited. He does get a little uneasy when other dogs invade his personal space too much. David is also social with other dogs. He has a large playgroup that he hangs out with everyday and does really well with. He gets stressed in his crate and barks a lot while in there. David will need training and will need full on exercise everyday. David is great with other dogs. It is humans he is very unsure about. David will need time, a lot of time, to fully understand what it means to be a pet. He may never fully make the transition to pampered pooch but we're hoping someone out there with experience and time will see his beautiful face and want to help him try.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Timid and shy, takes time to warm up\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Birthdate 8/30/2018\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Hey there, I'm Angie. Are you looking for a hiking buddy and a happy camper? I love exploring the outdoors!! My idea of heaven is a day at the river, or out camping in the mountains. I think dog parks are boring and overrated. I may not like other dogs (or cats), but I LOVE people!! I'm chill with all kinds of humans, and I love to hang out with the group.\n\nI've had it rough, but I'm still such a trooper! My humans moved out of our apartment and left me behind when I was full-term pregnant! I was all alone when I gave birth to three puppies without care, food or water. It was days before the local shelter found me and my newborns. By that time, we were all in such bad shape. Sadly, none of my babies survived. I don't let it get me down though, I'm still a great dog and I have such potential in the hands of the right owner!\n\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\n\nThank you so much for looking into wags and whiskers for your next family member.\n\nAll of our pets are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested if over a year old and will be spayed or neutered before being allowed to go home.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't always know the background of each dog. Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\n\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

Buddy is a small standard boy with personality plus! \n\nBuddy is an alpha boy who loves to be the boss. He is a a happy fellow and loves to have a belly rub!  Charming and charismatic, Buddy actually chose his own name! His foster mom in Texas called him various days and when she called him Buddy he started coming to it.  Buddy loves to wear a T-shirt (he thinks it makes him look more handsome) \n\nBuddy gets along well with other dogs but he has not been tested with cats or children, Buddy walks well on a leash and is well mannered. Buddy likes to sleep on the floor on a mat or on cool tiles.  Buddy loves his food and he will complain if it is not on time. He is a very fast eater and his foster mom has a slow feeding bowl for him to slow him down. \n\nBuddy has a big personality and likes to be the boss. He loves to be petted and loved and talked to! Buddy has quite the response when he is naughty and does something he knows that he shouldn\u2019t - he army crawls with chest on the floor, his butt in the air, and his head tucked down, making his foster mom laugh and laugh. He is a sassy funny happy boy who makes friends wherever he goes! \n\nBuddy is working on his house training and it is a work in progress with his foster mom helping him learn house manners. Like all dogs that come into rescue, Buddy will take time to adjust to any new home that is lucky enough to welcome him into the family. \n\nThis amazing standard dachshund is going to add love and life to any family he joins with joy and happiness! Apply to adopt Buddy today!",

Dixie, female, is a tall dog that looks exactly like a large smooth coat wheaten terrier .  She's the sweetest, most loving dog and would make a great addition to a home, but!  She is picky on the other dogs in her life.  We've seen her get along great with some and be aggressive towards others, so she is going to need a home with someone who understands this about Dixie and is ready to be patient and understanding of her personality.",

She was a great mother and now that they have all been adopted, it\u2019s her turn to find happiness in a home of her own.  Amy is a large dog who is just a big baby at heart.  She is very affectionate and outgoing.  Amy will make a perfect companion for an active family with older children.  Amy loves to play and would make a great hiking or running partner.  No trail is too tough for this girl.  She is very smart and eager to please; especially if she gets a treat.  Amy also enjoys a good game of tag with her play group pals at the shelter.  She would welcome having another dog to play with in her new home.  A fenced in backyard will be needed to keep her from roaming.  If you would like to add this special girl to your family, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "Meet Saskatchewan! \nOr Saska for short. \nShe is a 1.5-2 year old Husky mix who loves to play, and run! \n\nSaska is typically very friendly toward people, and will play with other dogs once she knows them, but tries to boss them around. She has nipped at another dog when it tried to drink out of the same water dish as her, but quickly backed down when she was corrected. \nSaska LOVES to run, and play with toys, if you hand her a stick, she will play with that also! \nSaska has a lot of husky type traits, such as being a runner, and potentially a door dasher if not trained properly. \nShe also is not good at this point about coming when you call her, unless you have a toy. \n\nWhen Saska came to us she was much to thin, and needed some time to gain weight back, she has done so wonderfully, and at this point is as high of a weight as she could healthily be. ( EST 45-55lbs ) \nShe eats about 3.5-4 cups of dog food per day. \n\nShe has no known health issues, other than seemingly having hip dysplasia, which we would encourage you to research before adopting, because she could require some extra care with that as she gets older in age, and should be given the proper supplements, and exercise to help keep her healthy! \nRead more here https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/hip-dysplasia-in-dogs/\n\nSaska to our knowledge has not lived in a home with other animals, so we cannot guarantee any of her behaviors with them in a home environment, if you have other pets, you will need to be experienced enough, and comfortable enough to acclimate, and train her around your pets. \nDue to how hyper she tends to be, we would like to see her go to a home with a fully fenced yard for her to play in.\nIf that is not possible but you can commit the time to taking her for long walks, and exercising her, that is something we can discuss. \n\nWe believe she would do best in a home with children over 13, as she is very hyper, and could easily get out of a gate if left open. \n \n\n\nSaska needs some basic training, like walking nicely on a leash, currently she has almost no leash manners, and pulls very hard. \nShe will come with a no pull harness, included in her adoption fee. \n\nShe is microchipped, spayed, and current on vaccinations. \n\n \n\n\nIf you are interested in this animal,\nPlease Call us at 435-723-1231 during business hours, we only have one Shelter Technician, so if your phone call is not answered, Leave us a message and we will call you back!\n\nOur Business hours are Tuesday-Friday 10AM-6PM\nAnd Saturday from 9AM-12PM\nOr email us at brighamcityanimalshelter@gmail.com anytime.\n\nWe are located at 1220 West Forest Street, Brigham City UT, 84302\n\n\nWe are Rescue friendly!\nIf you are part of a 501C3 Non Profit Organization and would like to Rescue an animal from us if not adopted, PLEASE CONTACT US!\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Date of birth 3/27/2018\n\n12/22/2020: Kaiya is a super cute 2 year old Rottweiler! She loves people and is extremely friendly and affectionate. She's super excited to meet new people and she gets all wiggly! She\u2019s a happy, sweet girl.\n\n\u2022 Kaiya loves playing with toys\u2014 soft toys, rope toys and Kongs! She loves running around the yard with her toys.   \n\n\u2022 Kaiya is very smart and treat motivated. She loves peanut butter!  \n\n\u2022 She walks nicely on a leash. Our volunteers love to walk her!\n\n\u2022 Kaiya needs a home with a fenced yard. She prefers to potty outside in a yard versus when she\u2019s on a leashed walk, although she will sometimes do her business when on a walk. But overall she prefers a little privacy! She was housetrained and crate trained at one time, but we think she'll need a refresher course and may have a few accidents initially. \n\n\u2022 Kaiya can be a little sensitive sometimes about a stranger rubbing her head, neck and shoulders.  Once she knows you, she's fine and enjoys being loved on and she rubs against your legs if you find a good spot to scratch! We\u2019ve done radiographs, including her hips, and can\u2019t see any issues.  She was overweight when she came to us, and we\u2019ve got her down from 94 lbs to 88 lbs now. In addition to losing weight, she's also on a joint supplement (Duralactin) to hopefully help prevent any issues. \n\n\u2022 We\u2019d like to find Kaiya a home with someone who has large dog experience and no young kids. She should be fine with teenagers who are comfortable with large dogs and know how to behave around them. She wouldn\u2019t be a good match for someone who\u2019s never had a dog as an adult.\n\n\u2022 Kaiya will most likely need to be the only pet in the home. She was returned to us after being adopted as a puppy because she was not getting along with the other dog in the home. When she\u2019s on a leash walk with other dogs she is usually not reactive and she acts friendly with dogs on the other side of a fence, but she hasn\u2019t done well when we\u2019ve tried to introduce her in the yard. She also needs a home without cats. \n\n\u2022 Kaiya has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heart worms. When she originally came to us as a puppy she had parvo, which she fully recovered from. She\u2019s an absolute sweetheart! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Hello I was having a rough time where I lived. My mom escaped the abuse and thankfully my mommy said I needed a better life too so I came to 'The Ranch' It is FUN!!! I run in the play yards I can sniff all day and the other dogs are really fun!! Now lets be real. I'm a coonhound so if you are a couch potatoe forget it! I'm smart as a whip and can open doors that have if I really want to. I would be great as a runners pup or agility. I do not like to be in the play yard when mom runs in the house and I will not be good as an only dog I will get bored and in trouble :)I may have a bladder issue that will need surgically corrected but we aren't sure whether it is because I get to busy at the ranch to pay attention to potty breaks or if I really need surgery so when I am adopted we will figure it out and the rescue will have their vet do surgery if necessary.My requirements1. Fenced yard2. Another pup to play withIf you meet my requirements I would LOVE to meet you!! Fill out and application???Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nLilah has the serious expression of her mother, whom we were told is a Great Pyrenees mixed with Anatolian Shepherd. Lilah has the coat and coloring of a Catahoula or Red Heeler, so we're guessing her dad must be some kind of Cow Dog. But it's all just speculation on our part, and the only way to know for sure which breeds contribute to her unique good looks would be to do a DNA test. That's not in our budget, but if you would like to DONATE one, we would be glad to have it done and share the results. :)\n\nLike most Anatolian Shepherds, Lilah is somewhat reserved, loyal to her family and pack, and distrustful of strangers. This means she doesn't do well at adoption events or even one-on-one in a meet & greet situation, so she gets passed over time and again. But when you win Lilah over, her loyalty to YOU will be unmatched.\n\nLilah could be a great addition to a small homestead, as she has proven to be safe with our goats, sheep, and chickens. She prefers living inside the house, but goes into the chicken yard with us every day to check things out.\n\nShe has been spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped, so she is ready to start protecting your home as soon as you're ready to start earning her trust.\n\nApply on our website at www.bluebonnetrescue.org.",

Teddy has early cataracts due to his diabetes but he can still see though his vision is somewhat blurry.\n\n~~Although we do our very best to make sure your new pup is in tiptop health before adoption, things could drastically change a month later. Since we don't have a long health history of your adopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam and follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** Diabetic. Cataracts. No other obvious issues found during vet exam. *****\n\nTemperament: -- This silly long-legged guy is diabetic and his blood work is at intake was a little sketchy, but he has made big improvements in his foster home, and his health is totally manageable with a strict feeding schedule and an insulin shot twice a day. Teddy is the most well behaved, snuggliest, prettiest boy. He loves kids! He is a great cuddle buddy during nap time, and he lets his 5 year old foster sibling put bows in his hair every day! He is great with cats too, and he pays no mind to more dominant dogs his size. He loves to go on walks and adventures in the backyard, and he's a good car rider. He's even well behaved during baths and blow dries! He will make the best companion for someone who is able to keep up with his feeding schedule and his insulin.\n\nWhere did he come from: Teddy's family moved to Europe. The paper work and quarantine issues to bring Teddy with them was just too much.\n\nAdoption: ***** $216.50 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 14 lbs.\nApproximate age: 6/2/2014\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

I have been with my foster family for about 5 months while waiting for my forever family to find me.  Here's what I am looking for in my forever home:\n\nExperience with my breed (Pit bull terrier)\n\nA quiet, calm home with a structured routine and not a lot of people coming and going.  Strangers scare me.\n\nSomeone who is home much of the time (I don't like to be alone)\n\nRegular walks and exercise.  I love to play fetch but the dog park is not for me.\n\nA room of my own.  I need a safe space where I can be away from things that make me anxious.  You can have visitors but we will all be happier if I am not forced to interact with them.  No crates please.  They make me feel trapped and I will do my best to escape even if I get hurt in the process.\n\nThe opportunity to be the only child.  Having my people all to myself would be blissful.  I like older kids but prefer not to live with the hubbub they can create.\nI am selective about my dog friends so I am fine with not having doggie siblings.\n\nAn owner who has dog training experience or is willing to work with a trainer to help me feel more relaxed and confident.\n\nI am a very sweet girl. I know I  sound a bit demanding but I will totally make it worth your while.  Snuggling up and keeping you warm while you binge watch TV is one of my specialties.  I know lots of tricks: sit, down, paw and high five. I can snap treats right out of the air when you throw them to me gently.  Did I tell you I love treats?\n\nUp to date on all vaccines, negative for Heartworm and Lyme diseases and microchipped too, I am waiting on pins and needles to meet the love of my life.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about Pearl, please fill out an application on our website by copying and pasting the following link into your browser:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2JnZqK5\n\nPearl is being fostered in West Springfield and the adoption fee is $300.\n\n\"Like\" Broken Tail Rescue on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/brokentailrescue/\n\nNOTE:  Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nWe expect that all adopted dogs will enroll in a formal dog training class with their new owners.  Obedience and training classes are an excellent way to learn more about your newly adopted dog, gain handling and training experience, and improve your relationship with your pet.",

I was surrendered by my owner due to \"moving\" It's ok I'm ready for the next chapter in my life. I'm a sweet happy go lucky boy and am always smilin and friendly to all. I'm very lively and active and love to go on long walks. I'm a very loyal boy and will stay right by your side and I love to snuggle by your head at bedtime. I'm housebroken and know basic commands but could use further training. My only vice is that since I'm part chihuahua I can be vocal. I will definitely alert you when someones at the door and when someones in the hallway or if there is general excitement in the air so it's best if I went to a home rather than an apt so the neighbors won't complain. I can absolutely be trained as long as my new human is willing to take the time to do so. I would love to be with another small dog to keep me company as well because I do have a bit of separation anxiety. I lived with a 8 yr old girl and was fine with her touching me all over,  but I would love to be with someone/couple who will take me on adventures in the great outdoors because I love being out and about and I'm still active at my age. Oh I'm fine with cats as well! If you're looking for a loyal silly fun loving boy to make you smile... that's me!!! \n\nFor more info/application, pls send email to: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

We always advise that an adult supervises when a child is around a dog during the transition adoption time. Zarah will need a yard with a 5ft tall fence or taller. She will need several walks a day to release her energy.

Of course, Clifford's Army Rescue Extravaganza stepped up as Brownie had no idea what had happened to his world.\n\nHe is one more sweet boy! He needs a home where he can be with you, preferably in your lap! He has had some allergies on his back where he suffered hair loss, but that is all better now, and hair is regrowing now. If he is the guy for you, please fill out the on line app, link below.\n\nThe on line application for her adoption is below. Please note, we do the following\n\n1. on line application\n\n2. vet and reference check\n\n3. phone call\n\n4. home visit\n\n5 meet and greet\n\n6. adoption\n\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again. No more hurt or fear.\n\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/",

Seems she is soulmate with her 12 year old boy but the 6 year old girl is the reason she is coming back.  Apparently there was a growl.  My elegant calm beautiful Dane is grumpy they say.  Here is the old description.\n\nSouthern California - We are trying to find foster or permanent home for the remaining 5 of our disaster Danes that came up to us last year from Texas.  Boarding fees are a challenge.  Please share Beauty with friends and family.  The right home is out there.  We just have to find them!  Will consider out of the area homes with home check and appropriate references.\n\nHere is our lovely Beauty.  A big girl, Beauty is coming up on 6 years old later this year.  She is a wonderful companion, great house manners, walks nicely on a lead.  She has had 3 meet and greets and simply great with everyone, but NOT great with other dogs.  She is okay walking by another dog, certainly not interested in running across the street to attack anything.  She is a queen in her mind and that would be peasant behavior.  But Beauty does not care to be sniffed.  Doesn't care for other dogs coming up behind her.  I believe she was attacked at one time and now she is overly cautious.  I spoke with a behaviorist who assessed our Beauty.  It might be possible to correct this response with extreme diligence and training.  But never to be trusted in the company of other dogs without supervision. \n\nWe are looking to place Beauty as the only dog in a household.  Children will be considered over 12 years old provided there is a securely gated front and back yard, 6 feet tall minimum.\n\nThis little lady can open gates, not to run away but run to you.  She knows her name, very responsive to verbal recall.  Needs work on obedience commands.  She is housebroken.  \n\nContact us at Deethenetworker@gmail.com.",

I would love a home with another dog that can show me the way and all that life has to offer. Leash walks are one of my favorites, but please be careful around my collar as I am reactive to my collar being handled and will react if you startle me in that manner. The staff here at BDRR will show you how to leash me up for a walk. Walks are my favorite! I am best suited for an adult only home with another dog for confidence building. I absolutely love attention and love being brushed. I love to cuddle and be treated like a princess. Once I feel comfortable, my true colors come out and all I want to do is give and get affection. I am easy to walk and love to be outside with my human. I love to cuddle up and nap in my bed. Because I am a few years older, I have outgrown all the puppy nonsense and have settled into being a great young dog. I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home.",

I am a little mischievous at times so please don't tempt me by leaving food on the counter (I'm a known \"counter surfer\") or unattended blankets around. I love to go for walks and be outside and will let you know when I am ready to go out. I am best suited for an adult home as I am not tolerant of young children.

He needed surgery for his eyes so they wouldn't hurt him anymore. Sammy has recovered very nicely from his surgery and his shoulder\u2019s wound has healed.\n\nSammy is a very vocal dog when he is playing. He's very loving and loves to cuddle. He is good with children but gets a little jealous; he will get between you and anyone or any other dog. He needs room to run and play as he is seeing the world in a whole new light with his eyes that no longer hurt him.\n\nSammy is house-trained. He weights 50 lb, is fully vetted, neutered, tested heartworm negative and microchipped.\n\nPlease visit Regard4Life Animal Rescue at Petsmart in Longview on Saturdays for more information.

            "description": "I know that you will love me and soon you will see, you were meant for me and I was meant for you.  My name is Prior.  I am a 64 lbs, 2 year old, male American Pit Bull mix.  I am a professional at conducting my potty business outside, so house training is no problem.  Although I may require a little coaxing to go in my crate, once I am in there, I am a perfect gentleman.  I have always had the looks and smarts.  But, I wasn\u2019t really sure how to apply all of those smarts.  So, I recently completed a 2 week boot camp.  I learned a lot about control and even left knowing some really sweet commands like, sit, down, stay, leave it and so much more.  Thanks to boot camp, I also learned some really fantastic leash skills.   Most important to me is finding a family that is willing to continue my training so that I can continue to not only be the best dog I can be, but continually get better.  I must admit, I don\u2019t do well with cats, but I would love to have another active dog my size in my home.  Small dogs are too little for me to play with.  Kids are fantastic too.  I would probably do better with older children, but if I find a family with a strong alpha member that continues working on my training, I could easily be a fantastic friend for younger children.  I would do best with a home that has a privacy fenced yard.  As you can see now, it is clear that we are meant for each other, so fill out that application!      \n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

She came into our program after being rescued after her family abandoned her. She is a little shy around new people but loving and sweet and affectionate once she gets to know you. She LOVES to swim and can managed stairs off a deck into an above ground pool and would love nothing more that a family with a pool where she is allowed to swim with her people, or play with her family in the pool. She is used to being around other dogs and cats and would do well in an active family - with or without older kids - that already has another dog of similar size that she can follow and learn from and play with to get her exercise reqirements met. She also needs some patience and time learning better leash manners. She is house and crate trained and loves to be brushed and have her tummy rubbed.\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet  and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

            "description": "Bella is a beautiful 3-year old female Pit Bull Terrier mix who was surrendered by her owner on February 7, 2019.\n\nBella has a white short smooth coat with patches of black on her right side and hind quarters, a long tail, and an adorable face with a black button nose, short semi-erect ears, and expressive eyes that beg for attention.\n\nThis little sweetheart has an affectionate disposition and a rather reserved personality. Bella doesn't rush into a relationship :) She prefers a slow introduction and a little time to get to know you before she turns on her charm. Bella, like many shelter dogs, is completely different outside her kennel so please don't judge her on 'first impressions'.\n\nBella's current kennel is one of our more open access ones with chain-link fencing on both sides so that she can interact with her neighbors (usually younger dogs and puppies), and Bella is very nice to them.\n\nHer previous owner told us that Bella has been kept indoors and is housebroken. She knows several basic commands (sit, stay, shake, and roll over). Bella has no known behavioral issues.\n\nBella has an allergy to fleas and must be kept on a good-quality flea treatment to keep her comfortable and also to prevent hair loss.\n\nBella weighed 46.2 lbs on intake in February 2019 and was already spayed. She appears to have gained a few pounds since then thanks to the gourmet meals our kennel techs serve up each day :)\n\nBella spent approximately two months in a foster home last summer. She was returned in mid-September 2019 because her foster family moved and there was an unfortunate incident with a door being chewed .. Bella prefers to take the 'Fifth Amendment' and doesn't really want to elaborate about the details :(\n\nThese updated photos of Bella were taken on May 28, 2020 when she enjoyed some out-of-kennel time in one of our play yards with volunteer Kathy Wilhelm. Bella has become a favorite of many of our volunteers as well as our kennel techs.\n\nBella enjoys back scratches, treats, and soft blankets but she doesn\u2019t pursue athletic activities such as playing ball.\n\nBella is a pushover for back scratches from her people friends and is often treating herself to a back scratch by rolling on her back and kicking all four of her cute paws in the air.  We've shared a video on our Facebook pages of Bella indulging herself for an impromptu back scratch during her photo session on May 28th.\n\nBella also LOVES blankets and is one happy girl when given a soft blanket that she can 'fluff up' to perfection.\n",

I am a large mixed breed weighing in around 65 pounds. I was abandoned and found walking down the middle of the road in Georgia. I am looking for a family who is patient and kind and willing to make me feel loved and secure so I can warm up to new surroundings and friends. I love to take walks, love to nap (they say I'm a terrible snorer), housebroken and crate trained. I adore affection and hugs but I also enjoy a little social distancing without someone in my face. I am protective of my person and home so a family without young children is required. I've joined in on some doggie play groups at the ranch to get to know some of my doggie friends better. Due to my previous circumstances it's going to take me a little time to come out of my shell and trust new people. I know I will thrive with the right family who is willing to put the effort, attention and time into me because I am definitely worth it.",

Chip needs a home with a sturdy 6' fence (PVC ideal), and someone willing to continue working with this scared boy. He likes other dogs and bonds deeply once he trusts you. He is not aggressive at all just very scared. If you can help Chip please fill out a adoption application on our website. Chip is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $250. If you are seeing this post Chip is still available and in need. Please fill out an application as the first step in our adoption process.\n\nAdoption applications www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received.

He was highly stressed in the shelter and we didn\u2019t hesitate to pull him when his time was up.  This is  Chihuahua personality with the good looks of a Pug. Auggie is a sweet silly boy, a definite lap dog and does expect full furniture privileges.   He loves toys! Auggie likes to play with other similar sized energetic dogs but is intimidated by bigger dogs. Older dogs may not appreciate his enthusiasm. He does okay with a dog savvy cat but for cats not used to dogs he would not be a good fit. Auggie is a resource guarder and because of this he will not be placed in a home with children. He has super sensitive hearing and will protect you from the UPS truck so apartment living is not in his future! Auggie is crate trained and housetrained when on a schedule. He enjoys going for walks and rides in the car. He is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, HW tested negative and on prevention.\n\n\nLOCAL INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE",

Alvin was very thin and needed extended time to regain his health.  He is now at a normal weight and a very happy boy.   Alvin is still learning to not jump when he is happy to see people, so we don't recommend him to families with young children.  Alvin is learning to leash walk and is very food motivated to learn new commands.  He would be a loyal family member! To meet Alvin, please contact Hill County Paw Pals by phone 254-580-0679, 254-580-5261, or e-mail hcpawpals@yahoo.com. An online adoption application is available at hcpawpals.org. An adoption fee of $165.00 will help to offset vet expenses. (This includes Texas sales tax required for all pet adoptions by rescue groups)",

Her puppies have been adopted and  Rose would now love to bring joy to a deserving family.  Rose is a little shy as we feel she may have been mistreated in the past.  All of her being wants to trust and to receive love and we hope she will soon be given a chance at a stable, loving home. To meet Rose,  please contact Hill County Paw Pals by phone 254-580-0679, 254-580-5261, or e-mail hcpawpals@yahoo.com. An online adoption application is available at hcpawpals.org. An adoption fee of $165.00 will help to offset vet expenses. (This includes Texas sales tax required for all pet adoptions by rescue groups)",

I am potty trained and I don't mind a crate either. I love the dog in my foster home and I love every dog I meet. I would love to have a doggie sibling that I can play with. I have medium energy and pick up on clues when the other dog wants or doesn't want to play. I mostly ignore the cat, sometimes I do get too curious and if you have a kitty in your home, hopefully it's a dog savvy cat. I am working on leash walking, well actually I do know how to do that, I am working on not pulling when I see other dogs or people (I just love them too much). I would love to have a fenced in yard. I still need to get spayed, since I had puppies over the summer. It has been scheduled for the middle of August and then I would love to go to my very own furever family that loves me like I love people.\n\nYours truly, Hartley Rose.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

My name is Shallow, and I am a lovely lady with deep affection for the people who give me the happy life I dream about! I am a beautiful Shar Pei mix - estimated to be about 7 years old and 60 pounds - who is available for adoption through Fetching Tails Foundation. I have some mild arthritis but I don't let that get me down and actually quite enjoy outdoor activities such as boating and dipping my paws in the water with my foster family at their lake house! I would love a grassy yard at my forever home so I can play fetch with my favorite squeaky toy and nap in the sunshine. I enjoy the finer things in life like lounging by your side and enjoying your company (I get along well with everyone I meet!), but I am not a dog who likes hugs and people clinging on me. If you have children, I would do better with older kids/teenagers who understand this. I am cat friendly, but would like to be your only dog because I like your attention on me.\n\nI have excellent manners and make a great roommate. I am potty trained, and can hold it up to 7-8 hours. Because of COVID, my foster family has been home a lot and I haven't been left alone for too long, but when they do need to leave the house I am content to nap and wait for their return. I am a great walking buddy, know a few commands such as sit, come, and lay down, and I don't even beg to get on furniture. If you are looking for an easy-going furry friend who will be happy to join you on outdoors adventures as well as lounge around the house on a lazy weekend, I bet I am the girl for you! I hope you fill out an adoption application soon so we can get out and enjoy the sunny weather!\n\nLove,\nShallow\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

Volunteers and shelter staff have spent lots of time with Chip to help him learn basic manners. He now knows the sit command and is treat motivated to learn even more! He loves to give plenty of kisses to his handler to show his appreciation! Chip is so deserving of a second chance and has waited too long to be in a loving home.",

My name is Kenny and am a SUPER handsome stud!\n\nI wound up at the Chula Vista Animal Care Facility because sadly my human family decided they no longer wanted to care for me.  I\u2019m not sure why, since I would never abandon them!  The wonderful people at Passion For Pitties were so kind to pull me from the shelter and now I spend my days with my lovely foster family.  My foster is still getting to know me, but I have settled in quite nicely since arriving home. \n\n\nBelow is a little bit more about me:\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m approximately 9 years old.\n\u2022\tWeigh in at a svelte 90 pounds.\n\u2022\tOverall my demeanor is quite calm and I\u2019m very well behaved.\n\u2022\tLOVE people and am a crowd favorite whenever I\u2019m out in public!\n\u2022\tEnjoy nothing more than spending time with my foster family and soaking up their AFFECTION!  I will cry if we are not together.  Who would have thought that a big guy like me would?  \n\u2022\tGREAT with all dogs, big and small.  However, don\u2019t like it when bigger dogs show aggression towards me.\n\u2022\tI\u2019m adventurous and always up for a car ride!\n\u2022\tGoing for walks is another favorite activity.\n\u2022\tAm potty-trained and know some basic commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown/off.\u201d  Also know \u201cgo to bed.\u201d:)\n\n\nPlease help us get sweet Kenny into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt our loving dog Kenny, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

Fortunately, the stars aligned and that plan resulted in their rescue and Soduko's journey to Labs and Friends.\nSoduko began afraid of the world, people, dogs and anything other than his corner. The last several months have been spent working with his foster. She's been teaching him that life can be safe, building confidence and life skills. His foster has brought him this far and he's now looking for his life partner for the next step in his journey.\n\nA wonderful dog with a canvas background painted with his foster and looking for a person to finish the painting with their details together. With a heart eager to please and a lot of smarts the sky is the limit with this boy. Chasing tennis balls around the backyard is his favorite game and he still has that playful puppy attitude. Intellectual stimulation, physical activity and regular training will take far with the person/family who will commit to being HIS forever.\n\nHe currently lives with four other dogs and a bird. While eager to interact and play he does not do well with dominant dogs so prefers a playful pup or easy-going mate. He looks to the other dogs for guidance when he's unsure and would thrive with a confident but tolerant housemate. He has learned that the leash is not a death threat but still needs an owner that will help him grow through fear with love and hold on tight when in public so he cannot bolt - someone who will help him continue gaining confidence through life experience. He has learned that the human hand is not always harsh and love can mean attention and affection - especially through a good deep full body massage. His partner will help him meet new people slowly and sit on the grass with him so he can roll over for belly rubs. He would love a home that will love him no matter what and without expectations. Is that you? Please apply and let's meet.\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org Soduko is located in Southern California.",

He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, crate trained, and gets along well with other dogs. Due to his playfulness, he would probably do best with dogs his size or larger. Besides playing with his fur-friends, PeaPod likes to lounge around the house, and when it's time to go to bed (his crate), he anxiously awaits his nightly treat. We are told that PeaPod does not care for the soft type of treat - he's more of an old fashion dog biscuit kind of guy. This sweet boy has a smile that will melt hearts. He is potty trained, is currently learning how to walk well on a leash, and is definitely treat motivated. To learn more about PeaPod and to add this handsome fella into your family, please complete our pre-adoption application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue #TBCGuestDogProgram",

I love to go for long strolls and yes, I'm a perfect gentleman on the leash. I'm kinda scared of new men and the HALO people have been working with me. I recently spent the night in a foster home with one of those scary men and after awhile, I realized he wasn't so bad. We went for car rides and walks, played in the yard, and watched basketball together. I also can be a little too reactive to other dogs at times and need to be introduced properly (that's what my HALO people tell me). They say I've been doing a really good job in playgroups and I have made a few dog friends that I am fond of. I am sooooo ready to find my person so I can stroll, go bye-bye, and lounge on the couch with them. Oh, and I'm pretty darn good-looking! If you'd like to meet me, I'd love to meet you so fill out an adoption application and let's do this! Love and kisses, Tyson\n\nWe are a foster based organization and DO NOT have our adoptable pets at HALO. You must complete an adoption application to meet the cat or dog. We are by appointment ONLY.\n\nAdoption application: www.halok9behavior.com/forms",

They were at high risk and so we pulled them and put them in boarding for a few days. The foster went to get 2 but loved them all and couldn't leave one behind so she took all 3. The foster he is in now also has his 2 sisters and another dog and he needs more time and attention then this home allows. As a result he's frustrated and taken to jumping the fence and going on adventures. He doesn't have issues with his sisters or the dogs in the home but is reactive when see's dogs on walks or on his adventures. He was dog friendly so I really think it's environmental. He just needs a foster through neuter and eye surgery and then he will transport up to us!",

He\u2019s a 1.5 years old big fluffy baby, a gorgeous boy around 60lbs! \nAs a teenage young pup, Blue can be gentle and loving, but also stubborn and demanding. He could benefit from some obedience training to learn better matters, but he does sit for treats and take them gently! \nBlue craves human love and attention, is a big love bug, likes to jump up on you offering big hugs and kisses, and demanding to sleep next to you like a baby, a gentle sweet angel. However, there\u2019s another side of Blue, he can very mischievous and stubborn, demanding the way he wants, becomes temperamental, so he needs discipline, and boundaries. Blue is very playful, needs lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation, or can be a trouble maker. He definitely needs an experienced northern breeds dog owner to be his leader, who understands the breed, sets rule and boundaries for him to follow. Definitely no young kids are recommended for Blue. \nBlue loves other dogs of his size, both males and females, and seems submissive towards dogs older than he is, so it is highly recommended for Blue to become part of a pack in a home with other big dog(s), especially the alpha older ones as a good role models for him, to put him in place, and to keep him occupied to avoid the boredom of being the only dog. \n\nBlue has been neutered, microchipped and current on vaccines. Please email us if interested, alljoy4paws@yahoo.com\n\nBlue is currently in Northern California, Sacramento area.",

I am a \"bait dog\" survivor of a horrible dog fighting past, who came in with extensive injuries, a bullet lodged in my rib cage, multiple abrasions and cuts as well as missing a \"digit\" and numerous toe nail injuries to where I am still limping while my paws heel.  The injuries were so severe, that I was told I would not have survived had it not been for CiMAR saving me and getting me to a Vet for the needed care before placing me into a wonderful Foster Home.  I am healing up great, though I still have a limp, but I love playing outside with my new canine friends.\n\nSulley is the sweetest dog, no trouble at all, loves to be near you at all times.  Loves the attention that he probably never got before.  Super gentle with the other dogs, and loves to play with any dog that comes his way.\n\nIf you'd like more information about me, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.  You can also find more pictures of me on their website:  http://www.cuzimatter.org/adopt-a-dog",

They had to surrender me because they couldn't trust me with the cat. I would make a wonderful let and I enjoy cuddling. I am active and healthy , spayed and trained. I really don't like other dog's either so I will do best as an only pet.Come to Cast off Let Rescue and meet me! I guarantee I will put a smile on your face.",

Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Diamond is approximately 3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nDiamond has had a very rough past. When she came into rescue she had an embedded collar, several open wounds and scars. We do not know what her life was like before rescue, but we know that she will never have to worry again. Since her past is unknown, her potential adopters must give her time to settle in. A meet and greet with any other pets is an absolute must. \n\nDiamond is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Diamond, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

I was soon adopted, but I became protective of my new Mom and I was later returned to the SPCA. \n\nNot many dogs here are made for outdoor life, but I have told staff I would be very happy as an indoor OR an outdoor dog. I appear to be housebroken, I know some of my commands, and I love to play fetch. But, I prefer to be the only animal in the home and I am not recommended for a family with children. \n\nI just know there is the perfect home out there for me... is it with you?\nLove, Wookie",

Once she is comfortable with you, she is the sweetest and the most affectionate girl.. She gets along with other dogs but is selective about who she chooses to play with. She does not care for cats. She is frightened of children so an adult-only home is best. She is very playful and enjoys running around with another canine friend. She is house trained and knows basic commands. Stella needs a understanding and supportive home where she can learn to trust her people. Once she is comfortable you will see a whole new Stella emerge.

She knows basic commands and is currently enrolled in obedience training to continue her training. She likes other dogs but can be picky about who she plays with. Because of her size and activity level, we recommend an experienced handler and a home with older (12+) children, where we have no doubt she will continue to flourish and make a fun family pet. Everyone needs a little Monica in their life!\n\nWEIGHT: 53 lbs, fully grown.",

Might not be suitable for homes with old / cranky dogs. Loves hammock time and chasing the hose. More so clingy than independent \n\nPuppy adoptions require a matchmaking quiz prior to adoption. Adoptions start as a 30 day foster period in which the puppy May be pulled if it is not the right fit home. \nIf you are interested in a puppy, you must contact me with the personality of dog you are ideally looking for. ie loyal, playful, calm, brave, dopey, etc \nThese are wonderful puppies. And they will only go to homes that will promise them a FOREVER. \n\nPlease visit Linktr.ee/lcpitbullrescue \nFill out the FOSTER APPLICATION\nAnd MATCHMAKING QUIZ \nI will contact you after evaluating them.",

He is fearful of new people but with the right person who is willing to be patient with him, he will be your best friend. Unfortunately he is more fearful of men. However once he learns to trust as he has with his fosters brother, he will reciprocate. From his foster mom: \"Lupen is a complete goofball. Belly rubs are his favorite kind of love, and hes more than happy to curl up in bed with you. If you dont mind, he will thank you with lots of kisses and wet willies. He has lots of energy so he will do best with someone willing to play with him on a daily basis\" Lupen is currently living with a 10-year-old girl so we feel he will do well with or without kids in the home. He is crate-trained and does best when he has a toy to entertain him. Lupen has not been cat tested, but he is interested in birds in his yard. His current foster says he is a sweet little guy and has made great progress in their home. We are looking for a family that will be patient and living to Lupen and has another dog in the home as a companion.",

He can be reluctant to meet new humans, but once he's properly introduced to them, he becomes their comfortable buddy - a happy and snuggly homebody. He's so exuberant when he sees the people he knows and loves. This lively boy is excited to exercise, and he loves going for walks, jogs, and runs with his foster. He's working hard on his leash manners. At home, he's just as content to curl up next to his people and play with his toys. He's also worked on learning new skills. He already answers to 'sit,' 'down,' 'off' and 'come.' He's also house- and crate-trained. Charlie would love to move to a calm home where he can hang out with the people he's come to love. A quiet home with few visitors would be best. He may do well with older teens and a well-matched dog buddy. Come invite him to go for a jog, and he'll trot right home with you.",

Lace would get so keyed up, she'd rock her stainless steel kennel. We were relieved when the entry quarantine period ended and were able to move her to an outside kennel. Exuberant to a fault, Lace would make a great running companion, rather than a walking buddy. She loves belly rubs and sits for treats. Boisterous and energetic, Lace would benefit from some training, especially since she's oblivious to her strength. Her adoption fee is $150 and helps cover her spay, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

Email is the best form of communication for us and will receive a quicker response than phone calls. Our volunteers work full time jobs in addition to rescue, so please be patient. Thank you!\n\nIf interested in any of our dogs please complete our on-line pre-adoption application AND our Great Pyr questionnaire (if interested in a Pyr) at www.tenderheartrescue.webs.com on the main page.\n\nWe do require that you have a pet/vet history which means you must have owned a dog (past and/or current) and your pets must be current on vetting which includes spay/neuter, vaccines and heart worm test/prevention.\n\nRescue related phone calls will NOT be returned until after 7pm. If you do call, please ensure that you are calling from the number you wish to be contacted at and that your number is not blocked.\n\nWe typically do not do OUT OF STATE adoptions.\n\nOur dogs are spayed/neutered, have been given age appropriate vaccines and are microchipped.\n",

He is ready to find his home in the PNW.  He's about 55lb. \n\nTex is true to his herding breed traits and requires a herding dog experienced family. He is super sweet with his people but can be wary of strangers, so he would do best in a calm household with not a lot of new people coming and going. He can also be strong headed and will benefit from a family that can give him structure and expectations. He is smart and loves treats.\n\nHe does well with other dogs and loves to play out in our play yard with his dog friends. He does not appreciate super pushy or dominate large dogs but will give them a warning if he isn't a fan of their behavior. Texas is a rough and tumble kind of dog that likes to wrestle. We do not recommend him in a home with cats.  \n\nTex requires an adult only home, no kids, out of the city with a fully fenced yard. No apartments for him. He would do great having another young active dog to play with in the home. \n\nTexas is UTD on his shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $450.",

And I'm blind, but that obviously doesn't hamper my ability to be happy and have fun, I just bump into things sometimes. My playing skills are top notch, almost as good as my snuggling skills! And if you combine those two you'll understand how I'm such a good wrestler with my dog friends. I'm also super talkative, so you can be sure I'll tell you what I'm thinking! Like how I caught Valley Fever when I was younger and need to take meds for the rest of my life, but nowadays I'm doing amazing! I'm like a little caterpillar who had to work really hard to survive and now I've transformed into this beautiful, strong butterfly who is ready for her own home. If you're ready for a chatty, sassy, and snuggly best friend, contact Mayday to tell them you'd like to adopt the pretty little butterfly!\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

The boy is more wary at first but infinitely more affectionate once he trusts you.  The girl is easier to make friends with but she doesn't give gentle kisses like the boy.  She can be silly, he can be a clown.  Both have lived with young children but the boy needs room to be and open space, stimulation.  Both are capable of killing a coyote or a strange dog.  Both are instinctual guardians.  They will not allow a stranger to enter their territory.  And did I mention hair????\n\nLos Angeles - These beauties, Tibetan Mastiffs, were well loved and life circumstances require this brother and sister find homes either separately or together.  They have not been living together very long.  \n\nBoth dogs go home altered, microchipped, heartworm and tick disease screen, blood and chemistry, dental, vaccinated, dewormed, groomed.  Please be experienced with the breed.  I would prefer opposite sex placement with one other dog.  Placements and any specialized care supervised by breed enthusiasts every step of the way.\n\n",

            "description": "From the foster mom:\n\nBasil is a full sized pup who is 50 lbs and has the most stunning brown eyes! She is always ready for action and has a zeal for living life to the fullest!  She has touched our hearts and makes us smile and laugh every day.   She loves to snuggle on the couch with us (both humans and canines).  She is so easy to entertain, as she loves bones, toys, and chews of all shapes and sizes.  Outside, she will jump high in the air in attempt to catch her toys.  She often misses and tumbles to the ground, but nothing stops this girl.  She just keeps on going!\n\nShe is crate trained, house broken, and is near fluent in basic obedience (still working on refining a few puppy manners- she just gets so excited about life).  She knows many tricks and is easily motivated by food, toys, and lovings.  She loves running and wrestling with her foster siblings, hiking, running, and walking.  She has the cutest and softest snore when she is worn out from a big day.  She is the sweetest pup.\n\nBasil is a brave warrior who has overcome many obstacles. Her scars paint a sad story, but she is ready to tackle any obstacles head on. She has learned what all the strange noises and moving parts to a house are and that the lawn mower is not actually evil. When new people come over, she barks and can be hesitant, but positive reinforcement has helped her feel safe and loved by newcomers. We are also still working on some puppy manners, but she loves training (especially for stella and chewy treats)!\n\nIn her dream home, Basil would be the only  dog or would have a tolerant and well socialized doggie playmate who will be able to handle her exuberant play style and can continue to teach her about all the fun there is to be a dog. She prefers to be in an adult only home (or a home with  older kids).\n\nI love this girl like one of my own and will provide free continued training to help her with a smooth transition into her final forever home. (I am a certified dog trainer.)  I promise you won't regret being patient with her as she adjusts, as she is such a sweet girl with a lifetime of snuggles and kisses to give! :)\n\nPlease apply on our website www.fourleggedranch.com\nFeel free to reach out with questions about Basil to her foster mom directly at 317-696-8479.",

He doesn't have any training, he plays a little rough, doesn't really know how to walk on leash at this point, but he is willing to learn. He has probably never seen a cat and might be a bit to rough for toddlers at this point.

I'm Dax, and I'm all in when it comes to most things in life, especially playing and napping. I like to run, romp, and chase things in the backyard. Then I'll power down for a good snuggle session on the couch. I'll do almost anything for a treat or a Kong filled with peanut butter, especially show you one of my favorite tricks - sit, stay, and shake. Do you love hugs? Great! I give the best, biggest hugs!\n\nI can be picky with my canine friends and sometimes I get so excited that I forget how big I am, so I may do best in a home without other dogs or with more laid-back pups. I also need to live in a home without cats or younger kiddos. Don't worry - I'm crate trained, but also responsible when given free rein of the house. I'm just looking for a forever home where I can relax and be with my people!\n\nI also am not the most polite pup on leash yet and since I'm a BIG boy, that can be a lot for someone to handle. I get worked up when I see other dogs, which is because I am just overly excited but it comes off as not very nice. So due to that, I need an adopter who has some strong arms, a strong core, and a lot of love and patience to help me learn better leash manners. I don't think I'd do well in an apartment since I'd be walking past lots of other dogs in that environment, which may be stressful for you and me both. I would love a nice backyard!\n\nAre you ready to go all in with me? Email my friends at PawsCo at adopt@pawscoadoptions.org or visit this information page: pawsco.org/adopt/adoption-process to fill out an application.Our adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

My sister and I were dumped out in the country and the cool folks at ARFhouse were kind enough to take us in and now I\u2019m looking for my forever home. \n\nI am a cool dude; I love to run, play and get into trouble (the good kind of trouble!). I will need training as I\u2019ve been on the streets my whole life and I don\u2019t really know what \u201cmanners\u201d are. But I\u2019m a smart guy and learn quickly so training me will be no trouble if you\u2019re up for the task! I get along well with other dogs and LOVE people!! \n\nThe fee to adopt Paul is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Paul, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Paul is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas.

He is a car chaser and can be very distracted. He does not know his own size. \n \nTiny also needs someone who feels comfortable handling and training a very large dog. While he is big, he is sensitive and will not do well with any harsh training methods. He is very playful. It is his youthfulness that makes him act like a puppy. He will soon grow out of this. He is very laid back and well behaved. He is learning how to sit and stay. He is food motivated and loves to sit for a treat.  \n\nHe is friendly and good with other dogs. He doesn't understand when other dogs are intimidated by him. He is very na\u00efve and would not do well with a male dog who is triggered by him. He has lived with male and female dogs large and small and done very well. Tiny has not had any accidents in the house. \n\nTiny was treated for heartworms. Because he is a young dog, he will likely have no long-term effects, as he isn't old enough to have had them very long. \n\nIf you are interested in Tiny, fill out a pre-adoption application. It can be found on our website or on the page that accompanies this description. This is the best way to start the conversation about adopting Tiny. We will take applications until we find a good match for Tiny.  If he is still on here, he is available.",

Definitely a head-turner, this pretty lady flashes intense amber eyes that set off her striking facial mask and shiny golden coat. Her gaze will grab your attention, but her engaging, sweet and lively personality will win you over! Halo is a spirited young shepherd and is seeking an experienced owner who will continue to guide and train her. She is housebroken and has mastered some of her basic commands, and she has done well both inside a home and outside in the yard. As she can be protective of her home, she does need proper precautions with visitors.  She can act up sometimes around other dogs, depending on her handler, and she's a no for small dogs. At the rescue she comes out of the kennel excited and ready for adventure. She generally meets and walks with other dogs, and is excited to meet dogs in playgroups, tho she can be too much for some. If you think you have what it takes for our beautiful and spirited girl, Halo is waiting to meet you. No cats please.\n\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

He came to us November 2019 from a shelter, where he was terrified and people could barely touch him.. we have come such a long way!! It took time and patience, but Jimbo will need someone who will is willing to be slow and patient with him, continuously showing him love and training that he needs. He does have separation anxiety, so it'd be so awesome if someone was able to be home with him, if not, he does well with blocking the door off because he wants to come with you. he's really good in the house, won't jump on the couch or get into things & lets you know when he has to go outside to potty. He gets so excited to see you that he actually SMILES!! its so adorable! He also has a best friend, his stuffed lamb. He takes her everywhere and can't live without her! Jimbo gives lots of kisses, so be ready once he's comfortable with you! cuddles not so much, every now and then he will surprise you! & he lovessss to be outside and get belly rubs! He will be your guard dog out there and let you know if he hears something but does not sit there and bark all the time. We are still working on the fact that people aren't something to fear- I think this is where the bad life came into play, he's still hesitant, in a fearful way, not aggressive, but it's a million times better! Fast movements are very scary for him, so no small children who won't understand how to properly move around him is best at this time as well, as he should be the only dog. He is on a joint supplement for his hips and will need that daily, so needless to say please don't expect him to be your hiking buddy or climb several flights of stairs everyday. He is up to date on all of his vaccinations and heartworm/ flea prevention. He does need a dental, which will be scheduled soon with the rescue so no worries about that and if he ever does need medicine, pill pockets with cheese are heaven LOL. Jimbo is the sweetest dog, has so much love to give and deserves the absolute best! Please let us know if you'd like to know more about Jimbo!!\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog please follow the link to fill out our application\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=SGVJMGQY\n2/2/21 4:21 PM",

            "description": "CHANTILLY is a 4 year old Terrier taken in as a stray with Lace on 3/5/20. This goofy girl loves rump and belly rubs, being talked to and is what I call a good walker with 3 modes. Mode 1 is fantastic and smooth. Mode 2 is when one has to tug repeatedly to get her to walk instead of smelling a spot for too long. Mode 3 is when Chantilly is pulling you because there's another dog present. She's a sweetie who laid down for lovings, randomly sat on her own, then stayed for a while. Chantilly's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover her spay, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

There's a lot of personality and brains behind my stunning good looks, but I've really got to be able to get through some of my energy before I'm \"all ears\". Routine is something I'm good at and I know exactly what is expected of me at my foster's home--I'm great with the other doggies and I am EXTREMELY affectionate to the caring lady who feeds and loves me! Are you the new parents I've been waiting for?!? I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home. \n\nFor more info about me or if you're interested in meeting me, please contact my foster, Judy, at judy_christiansen@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Hi my name is Colby Jack. My friends, 117 of them to be exact, were rescued from a hoarding situation in the backwoods of Suwannee County Florida. In my prior living situation I lived outside together with over a hundred dogs in large pens. I am more comfortable with dogs than I am with people, but with the help of the nice people at the ranch I am learning to trust people. If possible, I would really benefit from another confident and relaxed dog in the home to help show me the way. I will do best with an experienced owner who understands what helping a dog transition into a loving home is. The good news is, is that of all my friends who have gone to their forever homes are doing very well and I am sure I will too if given the chance. Because I have already been through a lot and I need to learn to what it means to be loved I think it's best I go home to an adult only home.",

I'm still a young dog and that means I'm looking for an active household that will incorporate me into their exercise and adventures. I'm just looking to learn! It's probably best if I live in a home without kitties because I think they are fun to chase and frankly they don't like that very much! If you've got a bit of patience, I've got tons of smarts to put to good use. I love other dogs, and they are a great way to help me get my energy out so that I can mentally focus a bit more. Let's meet and see if we're meant to be! I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home. \n\nFor more info about me or if you're interested in meeting me, please contact my foster, Judy, at judy_christiansen@yahoo.com",

I do like to socialize with other dogs here at the ranch (with proper introductions of course), but I would most certainly prefer to be the only dog in my new home. I'm still a young guy and my previous owner did not have time to properly train me to behave like a well mannered gentlemen, so any additional training would be welcomed. I love to hear the sound of my own voice and could you some help learning when it is ok to bark and when I should be a little quieter. I would love a yard to romp around in, so a free standing home as opposed to an apartment would make me happiest. I think I would be an excellent addition to any family and would most likely be a great lifetime partner for your little ones. But the most important thing to know about me is that I love people more than anything and I just can't wait to be part of your family.",

We are slowly coming out of our shell and my friend Henry and I are enjoying life with our foster family. We are learning how to be happy dogs. I am great with other dogs of all sizes and I am even good around horses. I'm still a little shy, so I would do best in a home with older children or no children at all. I'm looking forward to my forever family. I am a good boy and with the proper guidance, patience, care and love, I will make a great companion. My foster mom can tell you more about me and how I am settling into family life.",

I am a sweet and charming little girl with the most expressive face, so you're never wondering what I'm feeling or thinking! I love to meet new people and I am always craving human companionship. While I do love to be snuggled, pleas keep in mind that I am not a fan of being picked up and would rather not be carried. My ideal home would be with an adult-only family where I can be the only dog in the home and get all of the love and attention to myself. While I was Heartworm positive when I arrived at the ranch, I have been given the full treatment and am happy that the medical team has gotten me to be Heartworm negative. I would love a great big yard to run around in and roam and play with my new owners. I would make an excellent companion to any individual or couple and I can promise that if you give me all of your love, I will give you all of mine right back!",

I'm still a young dog and that means I'm looking for an active household that will incorporate me into their exercise and adventures. I'm just looking to learn! It's probably best if I live in a home without kitties because I think they are fun to chase and frankly they don't like that very much! If you've got a bit of patience, I've got tons of smarts to put to good use. I love other dogs, and they are a great way to help me get my energy out so that I can mentally focus a bit more. Let's meet and see if we're meant to be! I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home. \n\nFor more info about me or if you're interested in meeting me, please contact my foster, Judy, at judy_christiansen@yahoo.com",

No apartment life for me, I have plenty of energy to go around so a big yard to run and play to burn it off would be ideal. I know a few tricks like paw and sit and I'll do anything for treats. I can be strong on a leash, so a strong adult handler if best and if we could go to some obedience training together that would be such a bonding experience for us both. I am a dominant female and can be selective with my doggie friends so proper introduction is required and it is possible I will do best as the only dog in the home. I have more than enough love to shower you with.",

I love to run and play and splash in the pool. Male dogs bring out my alpha side, so a home without other males does is best for me to be a good boy. I'm a bit of a ladies man and I am great with female dogs. Oh, and I really need a home without cats as they are too fun much to chase. I am working on my leash skills and they are getting better and better every day. I would love to be part of your family.",

As bonded pairs go, we are inseparable and would do best as the only animals in the home. I am high energy and would benefit from proper training, no small children and an experienced owner. I can be sassy and talk back from time to time, but it's all out of love. I enjoy walks and meeting new people on our adventures. The amazing medical team at Big Dog Ranch Rescue made sure I was properly treated for Heartworm disease and I have recovered nicely! Scrappy and I just can't wait to find our fur-ever home!",

When I first arrived I needed some medical care and the great staff and volunteers at the Ranch showed me lots of love, patience, and attention. I am now doing really well and enjoy my play time in the yard with people. I can be a little selective about my dog friends (so I require a proper introduction to new canine friends.) Because I was a stray I need a strong handler and need training to improve my leash manners. I am so appreciative to have been rescued and can't wait to go to my new furever home! As with many dogs, I get anxious when thunder storms arrive, so take special care to let me be near you and tell me that everything will be ok.",

As bonded pairs go, we are inseparable and would do best as the only animals in the home. I am high energy and would benefit from proper training, no small children and an experienced owner. I like to sing from time to time but it's all for your enjoyment. I enjoy walks and meeting new people on our adventures. The amazing medical team at Big Dog Ranch Rescue made sure I was properly treated for Heartworm disease and I have recovered nicely! Skippy and I can't wait to complete your family!",

I'm great with people but because of my size, it best I go to a home with no small children as I don't want to jump up and play and maybe knock the wee ones down. No kitty cats for me as they are way too much fun to chase. I would be FANTASTIC in a home where we can be indoors and then run outdoors and play and protect you from the scary world out there. Oh, and one more thing, as many dogs do, I get anxious when thunder storms roll in. So please comfort me and tell me everything will be ok.",

Hi like children and I do like to play with other dogs but can get a little excited and may play a little rough so I need help learning how to be a better playmate. I would prefer to be the king of the castle if you know what I mean. I love playing in the water so pool time or trips to the beach would be A-O. with me! I'm not the biggest fan of visits to the vet but who would be? Due to my size and energy level it would be better if there were no young children in the home that I could possibly knock over. As with most dogs I could use a little bit of obedience training to help make me an A++ canine citizen. I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Diesel! I was found abandoned in a house in Broward County and just love it here at Big Dog Ranch Rescue! I have low to medium energy and my absolute favorite activity is always snuggling up on the couch. I play well with all other dogs, regardless of size, but would be best placed in an adult-only home. I can be a bit stubborn and don't like to be forced to do things, so I would benefit from an experienced dog owner who is familiar with dogs that don't always want to do as they are asked. I would like to have a big yard to run around and play in, if possible, but I think I could also be very happy living in a smaller environment such as an apartment. I'd like to join a busy family and I think that I may even be the type of dog who would like to go out in public with my new family on adventures. I would benefit from continued training but I appear to be potty-trained and I have learned to love going on long leashed walks here on the ranch.",

We are thankful to the nice people at the Ranch for bringing us here and showing us what a happy doggy life is really all about. As you can see I am really handsome with beautiful eyes. I'm looking for a home that will be patient with me as I get to know you. I need a little help in building my self confidence. Because I am shy, I would do best in a home with older children. I'm looking forward to seeing what it's like to live inside a nice home with a doggy bed to call my own. Once I feel comfortable and safe, I will shower you with love. If you're interested in adopting me, please visit our website and fill out the adoption form.",

I also love to be bathed and brushed. I am a very smart boy and I know some basic commands and I am house trained. I can be a little dog selective at times so I would need a proper introduction to any canine playmates and would most certainly be happiest and most comfortable joining a family without any other canine companions. I love my food and don't want to share, so don't be surprised by some protective behavior during food time. I would truly benefit from an experienced dog owner who can teach me that it is ok to trust others and allow me to let my guard down. I'm a big boy and a big bundle of love who loves to snuggle right up next to you on the couch for hours at a time! Take me home and I promise we will have lots of fun together!",

I really should be the only dog in the home and I need home that has a secure 6 foot fenced in yard, as I love to run around and play ball. I am well behaved, but would love an experienced owner that will help me work on my training around other dogs. I weigh around 50 pounds and would do best in a home without young children but older teens would be okay. Right now I am being fostered in Palm City, FL. You can contact my foster mom at: judy_christiansen@yahoo.com she can tell you more about what a great pup I am. I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home.",

I get along with older children who are respectful to my sensitive side. My crate is a comfy place to rest during the day and a safe place to sleep in overnight. I am house trained and learned leash manners with foster parents who taught me commands such as \"Watch Me\" and \"Leave It\" especially if I got too interested in squirrel activity! My foster mom says I need help with feeling more secure when new people enter the house. At first, a quieter household with few visitors would be ideal. With positive reinforcement, along with treats of course, I have come out of my shell and learned that pets, snuggles and belly rubs are the best!",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nMeet Baby!\n\nBaby joined New Leash Rescue along with her seven puppies last spring. She came from a rural area in South Dakota where she lived outdoors under a person\u2019s deck tucked away. All of her puppies found loving homes and Baby also found a family of her own but she was recently returned. \n\nThere were newly developing allergies in the home and in addition, she kept escaping her home (she didn't have a fence) and wandering around town. Her family was really sad but realized it was in her best interest to send her back to the rescue so she can find a new home where she will be fulfilled and safe. \n\nBaby is about 60 pounds and between 2 and 3 years old. She lives in a foster home with three other big dogs and two kids (age 4 and 6). She loves attention from all people, the more the merrier. \n\nShe also likes to play with her dog friends but can come on somewhat strong so we would prefer to find her a home with a playmate her size but another canine is not required. She would do just fine as the only dog in the home, too. No cats or small critters for her though. They are far too tempting and interesting.\n\nBaby crates really well and is quiet while crated and has not had any potty accidents since she has been back in rescue. Her perfect new home would have a 5 or 6 ft fenced in yard for her to romp around in and explore. She also loves car rides and rides very well in the car with you. We really want to find Baby\u2019s own forever home that can fulfill all her needs. \n\nShe has quite a bit of energy so her new family needs to be committed to keeping her exercised and content as a busy herding breed. No apartments for this girl as she can be vocal when she hears noise outside of the home.\n\nAdoption Fee: $350 + tax (no checks) \n\nPlease reach out with any questions to foster mom Andrea @ 218 831 6520 or tunelotti@gmail.com. \n\nPlease check with the foster if Baby would attend an upcoming adoption event. \n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. \n\nThere are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

He is a young pup looking for his forever home to love his new family and go on hikes, play ball with.\n\nHe does have a high prey drive No small animals, no cats,\nhe is best as ONLY DOG!\n, he is super smart and eager to please and learns very quickly.\n\nHe is crate trained and house trained. He loves having a yard to play ball in and has learned \"drop it\" means more fetch for him! He would benefit from continued training to be the best version of himself. He has energy, he likes to relax in the yard and is just a very happy sweet boy! Rides well in the car. He would be best with an experienced owner to continue training Elmer, he loves to learn, and he looks for your attention. He sits very nicely waiting for you to take him on walk allows you to put on his easy walk harness, he never pulled on the leash out on the hike. He is a young smart, and just wants someone in his life who will listen to him and be dedicated to his growth, and love him. Again, he needs to have continued training. He is young......\n\nIf you would like to meet Elmer please text 480-359-7109 for more information.\n\nNo apartments/condo Elmer needs a yard\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

            "description": "Humane Society/SPCA of Nelson County - ALMOST HOME\n\n29 Stagebridge Road, Lovingston, VA 22949\n\nPhone: 434 263-7722\nEmail: pets@nelsonspca.org\n\nIMPORTANT!!! PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nVERY FRIENDLY & ENERGETIC!!!UPDATE 1/19/21:\nYou don't know what you are missing! This dog wants to listen to your complaints and worries and to be-there when you need someone the most.\n\nDiego's eyes beg you to consider loving him, and if you do, he will love you back tenfold. He is a 5-year-old Shepherd (mix) that weighs 60 pounds. He responds to the words: SIT, WAIT, LEAVE-IT, GET IT, BRING IT, DROP IT, OFF, TAKE IT, and TOUCH IT. He loves pleasing the people he knows and whoever is fortunate enough to adopt him will quickly learn that Diego is waiting to live and die for you. (His estimated DOB is June 2015.)\nOne of his greatest joys is playing ball with someone he loves. He can catch a ball for an hour without getting bored, afterwards he'll cool off in any body of water he finds. He loves spending time outside exploring our big fenced yards. He thinks going for car a ride anytime to anywhere is a great thing to do. But at the end of the day, he really enjoys just relaxing on a soft spot in an air conditioned or comfortable room. He is clean in his environment and has proven to be house trained with good manners, in a home he recently stayed in for a couple of weeks. He also enjoyed their fenced back yard and did not try to dig or climb out. Unfortunately, the people were not equipped to adopt him.\nDiego has spent time at the facility of one of our trainers (Denise), playing in her big yards with other dogs. We learned, if there is another dog in Diego's family, he would do best with a dog his size that does not try to push him around. Diego is very happy to have canine companionship, but it has to be the RIGHT dog. He knows how to take behavior cues from other dogs. That said, Diego can be too much for some dogs, so he would not be a good candidate to take to dog parks. Planned play dates with compatible dogs would be best.\nDiego spent one wet day at an adoption event at Devils Backbone Basecamp. Dogs and people were all closely collected in the areas that had cover from the rain, and Diego was very well behaved. He loved the attention from people, and though he wanted very much to play with the other dogs and would yip and want to go up to sniff and say hi. He was still VERY good at listening to his handlers when told to leave it and settle down. He sat nicely to greet people and wagged his tail with happiness . He regularly enjoyed jogging around the perimeter of the site with his human buddy to catch a tennis ball and play in puddles. He didn't pull or try to get away as he sniffed, trotted about, and caught his ball. He had quite the fan club among venue guests but no compatible households for him.\nDiego is a perfect match for ACTIVE adopters who can give him regular exercise, mental stimulation, and put in a little time to establish boundaries and reinforce his manners. He will love to join his owners on hikes or other outdoor activities. Diego has a great foundation of obedience and manners that should transition well into a home. He needs an owner who will enable him to be his best self by commitment to follow through with his training. He loves balls, toys water and people. He's just a great all-around guy.\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting Diego, contact Denise at info@campmerricks.com. She can set up a meeting away from the shelter. Diego is selective about the dogs he likes. He is not good with cats and is too much dog for children under 12. If you have the right home for Diego, he will keep you smiling, help you keep your body toned, make you feel safe, will listen to all your complaints, will try and do anything you ask, will lie at your feet, will keep you company on car drives, an most of all will love you more than you can fantasize.\nVOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED.

I was transferred here from another facility & I am hoping to find my FOREVER home real soon. I should be the only animal in the home; however, horses are okay in my book. I would benefit from leash training since I like to pull from time to time. I believe I will do well with teenagers and older, but no young children for me, please. If you would like to get to know me better & are thinking about giving me my FOREVER home, just ask one of the Kennel Staff at the shelter to arrange a meet & greet for us! \n\nSincerely, \nBrutus",

I don't know what I did to deserve being abandoned like that, but I am very hopeful about my future. I do hope to find a FUREVER home real soon. Since my say here at the Humane Society of Marion County, Staff has found that I am a very smart boy. I know the commands, 'Sit', 'Stay', 'Down', and 'Speak'. I absolutely LOVE toys and playing around. I do need to be the only animal in the home and would be best with older children due to my energy level. If you have any questions, please see a member of my Kennel Staff Family, they can also arrange a meet & greet for us. I am looking forward to meeting you & going home!\n\nLove,\nRajah",

I was turned in by my owner through no fault of my own, I was getting to be too much for his aging mother to handle. I am sweet boy and am good with other dogs. I am not a fan of cats. Children 12 years & up are recommended, since I like to play RUFF! I am crate trained and like to play with toys. It is recommended to crate me when you are going out, as I get a little anxious when my family is gone. I am afraid of storms & needles! I walk well on a leash & I enjoy car rides! I think I would make an excellent family dog! I would love to go home with you, if you feel the same about me. Please see a member of my kennel staff family & they can arrange a meet & greet for us. Looking forward to meeting you!\n\nLove,\nTrevor",

When she's not showing off her tricks, she enjoys a delicious meal, relaxing, and watching old sitcoms. Mardi is potty trained and currently in a foster home.

After a culture, she was found to have a resistant bacteria so a change in medication was indicated. She is also low thyroid and takes medication daily for this. She is a super sweet girl and did go out with another dog at the first rescue. Because of her skin, we did not put her with another dog while in our care. She is so ready for a family to love. Pixie's skin is marvelous now!!! She still gets weekly bathes and loves them. She will remain on her thyroid meds for life, but it is not an expensive medication.",

            "description": "Holly is around two years old, 60 lbs, came to us originally as a stray never reclaimed. Maybe a Husky/Pyrenees/Lab mix? She is an incredibly sweet dog, little shy at first, doesn't know what a leash or toys are about. Loves a tummy rub and getting attention. Her adopter that brought her back said she was not doing good with their male dog. She generally does well with a male dog buddy but is NOT good with other female dogs. She is an active girl so needs an equally active owner.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases or adoptions of two dogs together. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description.This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nYou can also expedite the adoption process by filling our Adoption Application which you can find at: http://www.elmorehumane.org/HSEC_FORMS/AdoptionApplication.pdf and sending to us either by scanning and emailing to hselco@bellsouth.net or faxing to 334-567-8774.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nThank you!

            "description": "WHOOF! WHOOF! WE'RE BOBBY & DYLAN, A SUPER SWEET, BONDED PAIR LOOKING FOR OUR OWN FAMILY, A LOVING FOREVER HOME TOGETHER. About 2 years old and 55lbs, we look like a mix of Aussie shepherd, labrador retriever and something with lots of freckles, maybe a pointer or springer spaniel. We have been in foster care for a while and are so ready to find our own home. Our guardian shares the following:\n\n\"I love this adorable duo! When Bobby & Dylan first came to us they were extremely shy, untrusting and skittish pups. It has taken some time for them to get comfortable enough with us for their awesome personalities to emerge. Bobby (aka freckles) is adventurous and curious so he responds fairly quickly to a patient, calm and loving guardian. He'll begin by following you around as you go about your daily activities. Dylan follows Bobby while keeping his eye on you. Initially Dylan is very much a wallflower and he needs more time to decompress and begin to feel that he is safe in this new home with this new person. If all goes well and life remains fairly calm and uneventful, within a few weeks Bobby should start letting his guard down. Just be calm and patient and give them time and lots of tasty treat bits and slowly, they will reveal their loving, affectionate, funny, playful and adorable personalities. They are highly treat motivated so we spend lots of hours sitting in a comfy chair and tossing yummie tidbits of high value lamb and sweet potato jerky treats to them. This may possibly be the key to their hearts.\n\nBobby and Dylan are very smart, crate trained, housebroken (initially Bobby needs to be watched for marking) and we are working on new commands and good leash and house manners. They enjoy boisterous playing with one another and several of my pups in the yard. They love any game that involves treats. Check out Mental Enrichment Activities or Boredom Busting Games on Barkercise.com. Enrichment toys like puzzle treats, snuffle rugs and activities like hide and seek, find the treat, where's the ball, etc., help immensely with confidence building and bonding.\n\nThey need slow introductions to new people, places and things. Ongoing training and confidence building exercises will be a must to help them be their best self. They enjoy playing with other friendly dogs but shy away from bossy pups. Their are several simple precautions that you must take to keep them safe. They need a home with a yard to run and play and secured by a 6' fence. We don't recommend you take them on walks outside the fenced in yard until they have fully bonded with you. When you do take them on walks, choose quiet places that aren't highly used to keep it calm. Always us quality, escape resistant harnesses and leashes to keep them secure.\n\nBobby & Dylan have stolen our hearts.... they are two of the most precious pups we've fostered in the last 4 years. They need a little extra help to overcome some of their issues from living on their own in a scary world but they are so worth it! In the first few days, they will steal your heart with gorgeous looks, puppy eyes, endearing expressions, and shy ways. As the days and weeks go by and they start sharing their sweet, silly and loving side with you, you will feel so special that these gorgeous creatures are beginning to appreciate, trust and love you....they've chosen you to be their hero.''\n\nBOBBY & DYLAN are neutered and up to date on age appropriate vaccines. Adoption fee: let's talk! Please note that training is highly recommended for all dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing. Thanks for adopting and saving a life -- you are BOBBY & DYLAN's hero.",

            "description": "Hi!  My name is Milo.  I'm a handsome young dalmatian mix male about 2 yrs old who ended up in the LA City East Valley shelter in Van Nuys.  Luckily, Rescue saw me and made sure i  got out of there  quick. whew!   I am a shy boy, good with other dogs but wary of  strangers.  I will be learning  my leash manners now and  with the daily walking I should become less shy and more self confident in no time.  I am small and thin, only  38  lbs  when i got out of the shelter, but i know i'll be  eating well now!   Rescue thinks I cannot hear and that would be consistent with my breed and my very white coat, that would also explain why i am skiddish.   Because I am so shy and probably am deaf i would be best in a home with another dog or two and no young kids.  I am neutered, vaccinated  and microchipped so I am ready to go home anytime.   I have not had a good life so far but i would so love to have a new home and family to love.    Could  it be yours?\n\nIf you are  interested in meeting me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email at  dalrescue@sbcglobal.net .  To make sure  I would be a good  fit for you and your family, Rescue  asks that you complete an adoption  application, but once submitted and  approved,  arrangements  can be  quickly  made for  you to come meet me.   I would love to meet  you so please  email Rescue  and ask about me, Milo, Thanks!\n\nTo learn more  about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., please see our website   at www.dalrescuesocal.com.

Stoney is just about perfect in every way, and he is totally attached to his little brother Buzz.\nBuzz has been eating baby food, but has started to eat regular dog food now, late May 2020.  He likes to have a protected spot to sleep and keeps to himself most of the time.\nStoney is more adventurous and will interact with the other small dogs at the rescue.\nFor specific adoption information on this pair please call Anna @239-841-2382\n\nWe seek a calm , quiet, adults only home.  We will not separate the boys so they must be adopted together.  The adoption fee for the pair is $500.",

            "description": "#704 - Spryte | ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS\n\nHi! I'm Spryte, named after the mythical folklore creatures and their playful nature! I am a little over a year, fun, full of energy and will keep you on your toes! I am what my Foster Mom calls a \"Border Whippet\" which explains my size and stature. Female, spayed, house trained, crate trained (but I need a strong one as I can find a way to get out of those wimpy wire crates...). Other dogs are fun, especially if they like to move FAST. I've been known to outrun them and then jump over them as they get close. Did I mention I am a jumping bean and can flat jump over 5'? I'll need a tall fence to keep me contained. At night I like to sleep on my FM's feet when she watches TV, and sleep on the bed, always where I can snuggle up. I love belly rubs and ear scratches. I like to wrestle with the other foster dogs, and am too cute with I'm doing the bitey-face thing.\n\nSpryte will need an active home. She does well with older children, she can knock over little ones when she jumps, hugs and kisses. She is not good with cats or other small animals\u2026 too much sight hound. She does love to run, and would make a good running buddy. She would be an awesome sport dog with some training. Foster home has been working on the basics like house breaking, crate training, socialization, barking, jumping. She will need continued leash training and will excel in a manners class. She likes to work with a clicker and food. She is active, fun and quirky and smart.",

When Lilly came to us she had a badly mangled leg that had to be amputated. She also has a back leg that is not the greatest, so she does get physical therapy once a week. Lilly may only have 2 good legs but it does not slow her down in the slightest. She is fast and strong. Lilly must be the only pet in the home. She loves kids and would be a great family pet. For more information about Lily, or to schedule a meet and greet, send us an email or give us a call at 815.345.4646.",

He was adopted from Save A Pet rather quickly and named Bruno... However, he was returned back after the adopter's living situation changed. They were unable to keep him.\nBruno loves playing with his best buddy Duke! Bruno and Duke run around and play all day. Bruno's very favorite thing is water!!! He LOVESSSSS to play in the water hose- he tries to eat the water and will play forever if allowed. It's quite comical to watch!\nBruno would do best in a home with older children and not a lot of commotion/visitors coming and going. We have discovered that Bruno is not a very confident puppy and needs some stability and training that will build his confidence and make him a more well-rounded dog.\nBruno does not make a mess in his kennel as he did great with house training and should be easy to re-acclimate back into a home setting!\nIf you would like more Information about Bruno, please call the Save A Pet shelter at 478-994-3882.",

            "description": "Daniel T. is a distinguished 14-year-old male German Shepherd Dog (GSD) that was owner surrendered to the shelter. The shelter volunteers advised that even at 14 years old he still knows how to have fun. He tries to enjoy each day as much as possible which could involve an activity as simple as enjoying a wonderful sunbathing session. He was affectionately referred to as their cute grandpa dog by one shelter volunteer. He is not the dog you would go running with or take on extended walks but he would enjoy short meanders in the neighborhood and he definitely will fill your home with his abundant affection.\n \nDaniel T. Summary:\n- Daniel is a Male, 14 yrs old, weighs 105lbs, current on shots, house-trained\n- Good with Adults, some other dogs, and travel in the car\n\nAs you can likely see from looking at his included video Daniel is very friendly with the other dogs in his shelter playgroup and he does limp a bit on his right rear leg, The shelter vets did take a set of XRAYs of Daniels hindquarters and did confirm that his limp was related to arthritis in his spine, hip and stifle (equivalent to the human knee). This condition is not uncommon in older GSDs and at the age of 14 Daniel seems to be doing quite well... especially without having the benefit of medications for this condition. Fortunately for Daniel, the shelter vet immediately addressed his condition and got him started on a canine NSAID that should ease the pain and inflammation of his arthritis. Undoubtedly, this will have a positive quality of life improvement for Daniel so that his sunbathing sessions will be even more sweeeeet! Medications like Meloxicam or similar NSAIDs are also quite inexpensive (~ 10 to 25 cents per day) although Daniel's adopter will not need to account for this cost. Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will cover Daniel's related medical costs for the rest of his life.\n\nEven though Daniel is a mellow dog and would clearly pass the Thulani behavior tests he was evaluated to assure that he could be expected to be safe and do well in a family home. The behavior tests include a check to see if he will guard or protect food from people and a check to see if he will tolerate a full-body feel test that ends up touching most areas of his body (ears, snout, check of his teeth, lifting paws, gently pulling his tail, and much more...). Lastly, we always check to see if a dog can get along with other well-behaved dogs. Daniel did indeed pass these tests without any incidents and as you can see in his included video he does get along nicely with other well behaved dogs.\n\nDaniel was rescued from a S. Cal Shelter and was transported to Thulani Central in N. Cal (headquarters for TSGSR) where he is setting in. Daniel was calm and quiet for the 6+ hour ride to Thulani Central. The trip was broken up with frequent rest stops along the way not only helping Daniel to take care of nature's call but also helping our volunteer transport drivers get a break. At 105 lbs Daniel did need the help of a folding ramp to get into one of our taller transport vehicles but seemed to do fine with our assistance showing him the way.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming Daniel T. to Thulani Central. We are still getting to know Daniel so we will be continuing to update his bio.\n\nWhat's Next for Daniel T.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Daniel is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. Daniel will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nDaniels medical expenses will be covered for the rest of his life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Daniel, or are possibly interested in providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about Daniel on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/a4mbo02AlcE\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

Bruno is a handsome, friendly, strong, and energetic dog who loves to play and would probably enjoy long walks and hikes if you should so choose. Once he settles in, he would benefit from obedience training.  Bruno would do best in a home without small children.

Having a yard is a huge plus. Scrappy's  leash aggression has improved.   It does take Scrappy some time to warm up to new people but once he trusts you he\u2019ll want to give endless kisses and cuddles. \n\nScrappy is fearful of men, so it may be best that he be in a home without any men. He tends to gravitate more toward women if given the choice, so if he placed in a home with both men and women he will have a hard time opening up to the man in the home so if this is the case they need to be prepared to put in some work to help him trust.\n\nBecause he is still struggling with some social skills, Scrappy needs to be in a calm environment that does not have a lot of visitors to the home. He can be a bit a bit of an alert barker when hearing unfamiliar noises so may not be suitable for apt living.\n\nScrappy Doo has come a long way but still will require a very special person that will understand his needs and continue to work with him every day. Scrappy is house trained and crate trained. He still needs to be kept safe and secure. He can be a little reactive to some people but, with continued work to help build his confidence, we know that will improve.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

            "description": "Meet Betty! She was surrendered to an Oklahoma shelter in early 2019 in rough shape. She was only 30 pounds, depressed, and had lost all hope in humans. She is a Boxer/American Staffordshire Terrier mix. At her surrender, every bone in her body was visible. It was apparent that in addition to starving, humans had not been very kind to her. Betty took her freedom ride on February 2, 2019. Quickly after arriving in her foster home, it was discovered Betty had a severe case of heartworms, to the point she was coughing up blood. The first order of business was to get her healthy. She had to gain weight before she could even get vaccinations, let alone start invasive heartworm treatment. :( Thankfully, her amazing foster mom was able to keep her stable while she gained enough weight to be medically treated. \n\nUnfortunately she still has some psychological issues due to the complete lack of care she previously received from humans. ;( Medically speaking, though, she is completely healthy! She is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, spayed, micro-chipped, and heartworm NEGATIVE!!!! We are looking for a very special, understanding forever home for this incredible girl! \n\nShe knows basic commands, is very treat motivated, and is a pleaser, which makes her very easy to train! She is house trained and leash trained. She spends most of her time in a kennel, since she does not get along with other animals but she does not mind too much, it's her safe space and she has always done really well in the kennel. She actually seems to love spending time in her kennel, where she can relax and decompress after a stressful day (which is basically every day for this sweet girl, since interactions with most living creatures are not her favorite thing). \n\nBetty is not great with humans, especially men. When her foster mom takes her to walk at the park, she is very reactive to men in general, but it's worse with men who have beards. Upon meeting any new person, she needs to be given time to explore them and get comfortable on her own. She cannot be petted immediately upon meeting someone. She will take a treat from new people, but then she sits back and watches them as if she is trying to figure out if they are good or not. She also does not like for most people to reach over top of her. She has never reacted to anything her foster mom has done, from picking her up, reaching over her, grinding her nails, giving her a bath, but with people she does not know, she will give a warning growl. She has never escalated to a bite since being in her foster home, but that could be because once she growls, her foster mom immediately removes her from the situation. She seems curious about kids, but has not been around them and would do best in a home without young children, possibly without children at all. The main reason for this is that children typically won't understand her background and how to interact appropriately with her! \n\nBetty also does not do well with other animals. Her foster home has cats and dogs of different sizes and temperaments, all of which she was reactive to. She has worked with a trainer and in that process met several dogs. It is easy to see her focus in before she reacts to another dog, and she is easily redirected. She seems to be able to relax and ignore non-dominant, SUPER laid-back dogs, but she should not go to a home with any other animals. \n\nAs with many of our misfits, we will never know Betty\u2019s whole story. She was spayed at some point before she wound up abandoned, neglected, and completely broken in a scary kennel environment. The heartbreaking part is that it is glaringly obvious that humans have not been kind to her. \n\nBetty LOVES chewing on bones, playing fetch and going for a walk at the park. She is not a high energy dog, but she does enjoy a walk around the block or a trip to the park. She will play fetch for hours and when inside, she just wants to be close to her foster mom, chewing on a bone. Betty has her issues (would she truly be a misfit if she didn't?!), but she is just a dog who has had a rough start in life and wants to be loved. \n\nBetty is safe, loved and seemingly happy with her life in her foster home. But if there is any chance that we can find her a perfect home where she doesn\u2019t have to live in a kennel, she would be even happier (she just doesn\u2019t realize it yet). \n\nApply to meet / adopt her at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application",

He really is the total package! \n\nAlbert was picked up as a stray and was skin and bones, had a degloved lip, and had been shot in the leg. To save Albert's leg it was put in a splint for two months. After that time his leg was stable enough to save! Due to the extent of his injury, Albert has a limp on that side that he will always have.\n\nDespite his traumatic experiences, Albert is a happy-go-lucky boy and would make a wonderful companion. He is currently in a foster home. If you think Albert would be a great addition, call us Tuesday-Saturday 10am-4pm to make an appointment to meet him! ph: 352-589-7400.",

He\u2019s sweet, fun-spirited and will greet you with a smile\u2026 really\u2026. he shows you his teeth and flashes a winning smile! He is potty-trained & crate-trained and is a great listener. He loves to run in the backyard and chase squirrels and enjoys daily walks.\n\nJake will require some leash training and patience to be better on the leash and will need some barrier reactivity training. Since he was once a stray, he is extremely food driven; he will bark and insist on his feedings, and when eating, he inhales\u2026 but he will sit for his food. Jake has been wonderful with two female boxers but has had issues with other male dogs. It\u2019s my recommendation Jake be the only dog in the household. Super friendly, loves cuddling and would be a wonderful addition to any family that wants a loyal companion to love! \n\nIf you feel your home might be the right place for this wonderful dog, the place to start is with the adoption application found at www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt.  Once submitted, the foster will contact you to tell you more, and to arrange a meeting! The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00, which includes their vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\nJake is participating in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so custody and ongoing care are provided by the foster, not by DFWRM.",

            "description": "I'm a sweet athlete who works hard for my treats. I've got tons of get-up-and-go but I know when it's time to settle down and snuggle up. I've had some good dog friends, but think I'm at a point in my life where i'd prefer not to share my humans with another dog.  I'm also good with kids but sometimes I can get a little too excited - so maybe it would be best if your kids are bigger, so I don't accidentally knock them over.\n\nI love any excuse to go outside and am reliably potty trained. I know basic commands and am a dream on a leash. Although I thrive on attention from my humans, but I'm not a velcro dog and can leave you alone for five seconds ;)\n\nIf you feel your home might be the right place for this wonderful dog, the place to start is with the adoption application found at www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt.  Once submitted, the foster will contact you to tell you more, and to arrange a meeting! The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00, which includes their vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\nHazel is participating in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so custody and ongoing care are provided by the foster, not by DFWRM.",

            "description": "Born 10/27/2018, Hubert is an absolutely ADORABLE Chihuahua and Schnauzer mix. Just prior to his antipated eligible adoption date, Hubert was diagnosed with a significant pulmonic hypertension (January, 2019). A follow-up echocardiogram was completed in April, 2019, that recorded regular heart rhythm, no murmurs or gallops. The working status of Hubert's heart signficantly improved with his growth (it is not believed that Hubert will require surgery), but he is noted as having continued hypertension attributed to an underloaded left ventricle. He shows no signs of heart failure at this time and thus, the recommendation for Hubert's continued health will include (only) daily medication at this time, cost of which is approximately $85 per month). \n\nHubert is a kindly and loving dog with an affectionate disposition. He loves people and plays well with children and other canine companions. Due to the status of his heart, a quiter home without crazy activity is thought to be best for Hubert's long-term health needs.\n\nOur rescue is happy to share the findings of his echocardiogram results with any prospective adoptive family so that additional consulations can be made as needed. But please don't let a genetic abnormality prevent you from considering the adoption of this amazing dog, whom is as beautiful on the inside as he is on the outside!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Her previous foster parents have said that she's a smart girl who adapts quickly to new environments, and easily learns the rules of the house.\n\nHer ideal home would be to have active adopters, no small children, and a thirst for adventure! Her forever family needs to be experienced dog owners with dedication to continue her training. She is an incredibly loyal guardian, and will protect the home front! As unfamiliar people visit the house, she will need a separate room to rest in during their stay. She will need a fenced in backyard where she can stretch her legs and burn off some energy!\n\nKennedy's adoption fee is WAIVED!",

Almost all of your questions will be answered in her very detailed blog.

She can get along with some dogs but tends to want to be the dominant one, so a home with no other dogs is best. An experienced BT or deaf dog home is best. No small children, she is too rambunctious for them. She will also need a secure fenced yard to exercise. She is a beautiful girl. I have no problem managing her at my home. I am aware of the things that will set her off, like when I sweep or vacuum and I am careful when I use a flash light in her area, not to turn it on util needed so she does not bark. I do not have issues with her at night with the light reflections from our flood lights. She will need a home that will give her time to adjust and understand that as with most rescues, it will take a few weeks for her to feel at home.",

ROLLIE is a strong, compact dude who knows basic commands but needs a strong leader who has breed experience who is willing to work with him and continue his 'good manners' training. His foster mom will be happy to explain her training techniques and work with his adoptive family to ensure a good adoption transition. ROLLIE can jump a 6 foot fence if left unattended, so he will require outdoor supervision and will do best in an active home with adults or older children (teens). He is simply too rambunctious for small kiddos. ROLLIE would love a family who will take him hiking or engage him in a game of fetch or even treat him to supervised swimming... this is his idea of time well spent! He would do best as an only dog as he really just gets a bit wound up in the company of other dogs:) Due to his activity level, an apartment or condo will not work, he needs room to run!\n\nROLLIE is full grown, a true wiggle-butt, who weighs about 35 lbs. He has been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped and is just waiting for his own forever home. If it is with you, please complete our online application at www.helpadogsmile.org. Please note, we do home visits prior to adoptions, so local Phoenix area adoptions only!\n\nROLLIE's adoption fee of $200 helps with medical expenses of the rescue.",

She is an Olympic snuggler!  So affectionate and loves lying on top of her person.\n\nKarma had a bad past and is not  socialized with other dogs so she needs to be an only dog for now.  She would need someone to work with her and a trainer to see if she can be okay with other dogs down the road.  She was just spayed so that should also help.   She really is a Velcro dog who sticks to her person and family like glue! \n\nThis young, beautiful girl is looking for her loving forever home. \n\nPlease contact Christine at crisley1@prodigy.net if interested. \n",

She was saved by another private rescuer who didn't realize she was pregnant, at that point she reached out for help as it was beyond her abilities. We were happy to help and Cilla settled in without missing a step. After she whelped and weaned her pups she did have an incident while playing with a small dog and others in the yard but we do not know what happened, the dog was severely injured. She also needs to be in a home with other confident dogs. Cilla did amazing with all of the fosters dogs except 1, that dog was very nervous and unsure. This girl is crate trained, house trained, likes to swim, loves kids, well loves people in general and is good with most dogs.\n\nIf interested in helping Cilla please contact us!\nTo Contact Us\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW Fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application Fill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application Email us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

She likes to think she's the boss, so we have to remind her that she has more fun when she is gentle and calm.   Bella is mouthy and that startles people .   She isn't very reliable with other animals.  She needs a home with a fenced yard and a human best friend .  She would possibly do well as a truckers dog .  One or two people in the house would be best.  But definitely someone that is confident and trusting.  We know there is a family out there for her. \n\nPlease fill out an application at www.marc4change.org/adoptions/dogadopt/\n\n",

            "description": "Gizmo was as sad as any dog we have brought into rescue when he came. He\nwas at our vet clinic for weeks and several times we weren't sure he would pull\nthrough, took him almost a week to raise his head when it was time to interact;\nand a couple of weeks before he would make eye contact. \n\nSomeone had chopped his ears off and he presented as a bait dog, emaciated, scarred and emotionally shut down.\n\nHard to believe he's the same loving, outgoing dog he is today. Attention and\nfood are his favorite two things. He gets along w/most of the other dogs in his\nfoster home except when it's time for attention and then he wants it all for\nhimself. He has regained his appetite for food and for fun - he loves to be part of\nwhatever is going on with his family.\n\nGizmo is crate trained although he's not a fan of the crate and he has good\nhouse manners but if he has to go he usually needs to go right away so his\nfamily will need to be aware when he's asking to go out.\n\nHe would be OK in a home with another dog as long as they get along initially but\nhe has met a couple of guys he just doesn't like. He would be fine as an only\nfurkid and enjoy having his humans all to himself.\n\nGizmo is on an anti-inflammatory and thyroid medication full time to keep his\nhealthy and active. He's great about taking his meds and neither is very\nexpensive. He's active, healthy, and ready for his forever home. This guy will\ngive back all the love and devotion any dog could possibly bring to their home.",

            "description": "We cover Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wisconsin and transportation is available for adoptions within those states. Otto is currently in Iowa. \nThis big handsome hunk is Otto. Otto is a special guy. \n\nOtto has been through some things in his 5 years. Some good, and some bad. Otto has a little baggage from all that but hes ready to live the next 5 years of his life in a much different way!\n\nHes a big guy, and still needs to lose a few pounds. Hey, he likes his cookies. But he also loves playing in the yard, fetch, and walks, so it should be easy to help him get his summer body ready. He also likes to play with other dogs that are medium to large size. Hes okay with smaller dogs too, as long as they dont pester him too much. Hes pretty good at knowing when to leave another dog alone if that dog is a fun hater. Otto enjoys going for walks, and does pretty well on a leash, although he occasionally tries to chase loud vehicles. We walk him in a Halti, and its easy to redirect him if he does try to do that. \n\nOtto likes his person. Hes okay with other people, too, after getting a chance to check them out and they take the time to let him get used to them being around. But once he trusts you you are HIS PERSON. He will seek you out, and respect you, and want to do what you are doing. He will sit in your lap and wait for you to scratch his booty and his back. It would be advantageous if his forever person had some experience with large, stubborn, handsome dogs, and can be a strong, confident leader for Otto.\n\nWhen Otto likes something, he REALLY LIKES IT. So occasionally, he will feel the need to guard the things he likesyouhis ballhis foodhis space. From others. So if you are meant to be Ottos person, you will need to be watchful of that and be ready to offer him a better deal- hot dog pieces are always effective- to change his mind. For this reason, although Otto does like kids, older kids who can help him disengage from this behavior if needed would be the best fit, if his person has a family. His foster mom does not have any issues with changing his mind, all it takes is a stern NO, and a change of scenery. \n\nThis guy thrives on structure and boundaries. Although he is very well behaved in the house and is perfectly potty trained and does not chew things that are not meant to be chewed, he can get a bit big for his britches if he does not have some boundaries. Some kennel time is great for this, and his foster mom has him earn every last bit of food or treats he gets with obedience and trick cues. Otto enjoys being able to give the right answers to get his rewards! Otto also needs TIME to learn to trust new people. Otto's potential adopter must be willing to take it VERY SLOW with handling. Otto can be very defensive of his head and neck area at first. His first couple of weeks MUST be dedicated to decompression, and we highly recommend that he wear a leash during that time for low-pressure handling as he learns to trust his new person.\n\nOttos perfect forever home might look like this another middle-aged dog who likes to play occasionally, but knows when enough is enough a yard with a deck or sunny spot to nap on when the weather is good, or a person who enjoys medium-length walks a couple times a day a person who can give him structure and boundaries- not prison style (you will sit in one spot all day and eat slop for dinner), but more like grade-school style (no Johnny, you may not sit on the teachers desk or write bad words on the board. No Suzie, you cannot eat the lunch of the girl sitting next to you while shes looking the other way). Otto would like a home that doesnt have too many visitors in and out, and when there are visitors, he has a chance to meet them on his own terms, in a polite way, of course. Hed love a couple games of fetch each day, and some booty and back scratches to finish things out. \n\nRemember that whole thing about Otto needing to be able to check people out on his own terms? Well, usually when he has to go see the vet, he cant do that. So for that reason, he is muzzle trained and can wear a muzzle for situations just such as that. His muzzle will accompany him to his forever home, like an old friend. \n\nSo, hes not perfect! But then again, perfect is boring.",

They weren't able to keep me so they called this nice rescue to see if they could help me find a mom. Because of a foster person, they said yes and here I am living the good life until I find my new family. I am a Shepherd/Husky mix. I am about 3 years old and weigh appx 65lbs. As you can see i love my toys. I am good with the female dogs that I have met and would probably be ok with laid back submissive males too. I don't share very well whether its my person or toys. It is believed that I was once a house dog because I am crate trained and I don't mind being in it as long as my stuff can be in it with her. I am housebroken also.Now if you meet my you might think something wrong with my leg. My rescue mom thought so too but the vet says it's fine and could possibly be an old injury. Doesn't bother me much so I hope it won't bother you either. \nIf you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com. Please allow 24 hours for a reply.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam\n",

Approx 70-80 pounds. \n\nAge: Otto is around 3.5 years old. \nTemperament: Otto is very sweet & athletic. He was adopted by us when he was around 2 years old and was recently returned. Otto would do best in a home with no children as sometimes he can have an attitude problem. He has been doing very well while with us and we haven\u2019t had any issues with his behavior. \n\nActivity Level: Otto is ACTIVE. He would be a great running or hiking buddy. He has energy and his forever person would need to keep him occupied. \n\nVetting: Otto has been neutered, vaccinated, & heartworm rested. \n",

He originally was surrendered to Plumas County Animal Control after spending a lot of times roaming the streets here in Portola. He was only here for a short stint initially before being adopted into a home. Unfortunately, it was not the right fit and owners, and McCloud was returned to us after some fearful interactions with strangers approaching him. Since he has returned we have been working with McCloud and he is now muzzle-trained so that he can go on walks and be less fearful of the strangers that he passes by. He is a dog that wants to please his owners and would be a very good dog for someone who is looking for a dog who likes to alert them when people approach the house. He gets along with other dogs, able to chase toys and let other dogs have them, but he can be a little guarded of his toys when they are in his possession (only from other dogs though). McCloud is looking for his forever home still and would love to show some humans how far along he has come in order to fit right into his family. If you are interested in meeting McCloud, please fill out an application on our website www.highsierraanimalrescue.org. We do not discuss any potential adoptions without an already submitted application.",

            "description": "Sassy came to us very pregnant after being dumped in a shelter here in Texas. All her babies have gone on to find homes except for scruffy jean (who is also listed for adoption).\n Sassy is around 30 lbs and about the size of a beagle...which we believe she is mixed with.  Her coat and a lot of her personality lean towards being a possible sharpei mix as well. \nSassy and her daughter have very shy personalities when meeting new people.  They also do not love going to the vet or car rides. We really believe this is just a personality quirk as we know Scruffy Jean has never been abused and the other female puppies has similar traits as mamma. \nSassy only \"negative\" trait is her shyness and while she can be fearful she is not aggressive.  She loves to play with other dogs and loves to be bossy but she is also so sweet and cuddly.... a lap baby who would love nothing more than a quiet home with maybe another dog for a play friend. \nSassy is crate trained and actually really loves her kennel as it makes her feel safe and gives her comfort. She LOVES treats and bones of any kind.  She does do well on a leash and harness and with time and some patience we feel she may get used to going new places but would certainly like walks around the neighborhood to start. \nBecause of her shyness, Sassy is only available to adopt to local homes near to Houston tx area.  Any adopters will need to meet her first in her own home environment as traveling and new places are currently scary for her. \nIf you have any further questions or would like an application to adopt please don't hesitate to email us. \nSassy deserves a home and family of her own where she can get all the love she craves.",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Layla is approximately 4 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nWe do not know much about Layla's past except it was not a good one. She came into rescue with battle wounds that are slowly healing. Until Layla can trust again, we feel she would do best in a home with no other pets. One day when she knows she is safe, we would properly introduce her to other pets. Layla is a complete love bug. She loves belly rubs, playing outside & cuddling! \n\nLayla is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Layla, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

            "description": "Blackie keeps getting over looked because he\u2019s a big black dog. He\u2019s about a year old now, neutered, microchipped and weighs about 75 pounds. He takes treats so very gently and does know a few commands. He just doesn\u2019t realize he is as big as he is. He gets so excited and really would love to have another four legged friend to romp around with. \nHe was a stray in the Olive Branch area and needed help. He's doing well on leash and is mastering not jumping up on people.  He was on a farm and decided chickens were too much fun to chase.  That didn't work out too well for him. \nHe would love to have a romping partner to play with.  He hasn't bothered any of the cats in his foster home.\nSadly, Blackie tested very light positive for heartworms and has now taken his 30 days of Doxycycline.  He is now on Advantage Multi to treat his heartworms with the slow kill method.  Hopefully he will test negative in the next 6-12 months with this treatment. \nHis adoption fee is $150 and would include supplying the  Doxycycline and Advantage Multi for his treatment.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

HE WILL BE READY FOR ADOPTION IN JULY.<p>\n\nJOEY is a friendly, 1-year-old, 40-pound Hound mix.\n\nJOEY is playful, enthusiastic, and game for anything!  He's got a lust for life and the power to infect everyone around him with the same!\n\nJOEY is a wonderful companion and would be a fantastic addition to any family!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "I came to rescue after I wound up at animal services as a stray and one ever came to claim me. A nice volunteer with From The Heart offered to take me in to save my life. I am a sweet boy! I get along with other dogs too. I had a rough life before coming to rescue. I had mange AND heartworm AND erlichia! From The Heart made sure I received the vet care I needed to get better. With TLC and vet care I am now a happy healthy boy again! I also had a tumor removed! It looked a little funny so we had it sent off to be looked at in a lab. Turns out it was cancer! Luckily, the vet said they removed all of it! She said that there's a chance it could grow back again...or there's also a chance I'll never have another tumor ever again and will live a full life. She says that's life! You never know with these kinds of things...I'm feeling great now and living every moment to the fullest! I am such a happy thing! I'm feeling great and I'm doing well! I had a rough start in life. The heartworm unfortunately took it's toll on me. I have a small heart murmur from the damage they did inside my heart. So far it's not giving me any trouble. In fact, I don't even notice it! I am very photogenic and I'm such a smiley boy. I'm housebroken and walk great on a leash.l I love walks! My foster mom has even taught me how to sit. I'm very loyal and I can't wait to have a family all of my own! Fill out an adoption application to meet me! Learn more about me and fill out an online adoption application on the From the Heart Rescue website at: www.fthar.org.\n\nMy requested adoption donation includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations and medical care to date, microchip implantation and registration, collar, leash, ID tag, health check-up and one month of free pet health insurance (some restrictions may apply).\n\nIf Im not exactly what you want, please visit my other friends in rescue at From The Heart Rescue on our website at www.fthar.org.",

Sue Sue will be a great hiking companion and dedicated protector.  She will keep you on schedule and not let you get out of line.  \n\nSue Sue knows her name, how to SIT and is fully crate trained.

            "description": "Sweet Sarge dog Dixie was feeling terrible within a day or so of her arrival at the Adoption Center. Thankfully, Dr. Frankie at Haywood Animal Emergency was able to figure out the puzzling symptoms and diagnose Addison's disease. Her recovery was dramatic, literally overnight, and she is now a happy, lively wonderful young dog. Addison's disease (hypoadrenocorticism) is caused by a lower than normal production of hormones, such as cortisol, by the adrenal glands. Treatment requires a monthly injection to supplement the adrenal hormones. This makes her 'special needs' and perhaps difficult to place, We're hopeful that potential adopters will see beyond the Addison's, and recognize the wonderful, happy dog whose condition can be well controlled with medication. As far as her new home, we have not observed her behaving well with other dogs, so she would need to be the only dog in a new home.If you'd like to give Dixie a chance for a great life in your home, please complete the application on our website, www.sarges.org, and we'll contact you to set up an appointment for a meeting. 2/2/21 10:16 AM",

She carries them around the house and takes one on walks.  It is pretty adorable!  \n\nLexie has such a gorgeous tuxedo coat, is solid muscle and knows commands such as sit, down and shake, she is really just the sweetest.  \n\nLexie has not been around children but we believe with proper introduction and supervision, she would be fine with them.  She is an energetic girl so older children would probably be best.\n\nLexie has a very high prey drive and would do great as an only pet, so no pets or outdoor farm animals as she will chase them.  Lexie is working on her reactivity towards dogs when walking on a leash and is doing better but still needs some practice.   She is the cutest bumble bee we have ever seen!\n\nFun Facts:\n\nAge (best guess) - 3-4 years\nBreed (best guess) - Pitbul\nCurrent Weight - 52 lbs\nDog Friendly - Very Selective, an only dog home is best\nCat Friendly - No\nKid Friendly - Unknown\nPotty Trained - Yes\nCrate Trained - Yes\nLeash Trained - Yes\n\nAll of our adult dogs are current on vaccinations, de-wormed, heart worm tested, spayed/neutered, on monthly preventatives & micro chipped prior to adoption. \n\n*Adoption Fee is $200.00, No out of State Adoptions ,Virtual Home Visits \n Required  \n\n*We do not require fenced yards for all dogs, fenced yards are required based on a dogs needs. *No invisible fences.\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please fill out an adoption application at www.unchainedmelodies.org/adopt/\n\nThank you for adopting!",

I might need the country life, where life is slow and quiet. I\u2019m in a foster home now where I can work on my fears and other obstacles along with my foster family. I\u2019m a sweet, healthy, beautiful, goofy, playful, and smart pup who loves being petted and groomed. I stomp my foot when I\u2019m ready to play! I even know sit, paw, stay, lay down and heel. I\u2019m house trained and like car rides. I might do best in a home as the only animal and with no children. More info coming soon\u2026",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

I was extremely skinny at first but under the care of the nice folks here at the rescue I am now a healthy weight! The \"one ear up and one ear down\" thing is especially endearing, don't you think?   I was taken in by a kind neighbor who took care of me for a year and a half and then relinquished me to Halfway to Home so I can find a forever home. I am a very friendly, strong, and energetic dog who loves to play with balls and squeaky toys). Dogs like me...but cats..well...not so much, probably because I like to chase them. I am house-trained (bonus!) but would like some obedience training to make sure I understand my owner's expectations and ensure I am a trusted and loyal member of the family.  For more information about me, please call Sandy at tele# 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).  Please come see me soon!  And of course, \"May the Force Be With You\".  *wink*",

She loves people and enjoys playing with toys. Fetch is one of her favorite pastimes! Per her previous owners, Maya is housebroken, good with children, knows her commands like sit, stay and leave it, and was good in the home and yard. Maya walks well on a leash, but does get excited when she sees other dogs, so will do best with an owner who can continue her training. Once she has a chance to greet the other pups, she walks nicely in a group of dogs.  She seems more relaxed when she is off leash and has been well-behaved around dogs in playgroup (but she's a no for cats). Maya deserves a home where she can run freely with her toys and play fetch with her owner! She is ready and waiting to meet you, wherever you may be.\nMaya needs a special diet for intestinal issues.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Rocco is very people-oriented: every time his foster family is watching TV together he tries to get as close as possible to them, observing them or just sleeping somewhere nearby.\nRocco was surrendered by his owner because he cannot walk well. He is underweight (56 pounds) and needs special care. We don't know the reason for his knee injuries but the good news is that with few medical procedures his life should dramatically improve!\nRocco will become a loving friend for a whole family: despite all the difficulties walking he still comes to you to cuddle.. Also he is very smart: Rocco learned \"shake\" in 10 minutes! He will be best in a family with no other pets because he is scared of other dogs. Dog behavior specialist is working with Rocco and the progress is really great so far, but he will still need some time and a patient family to overcome those issues.\nAdoption Application: https://angelsfurryfriends.org/adoption-application/",

Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nBREED RESTRICTIONS/SPECIAL ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: Background and home check; must have completely enclosed/fenced yard; and no apartments. \n\nJack is a handsome boy who came to us as a stray; therefore, we do not have any background information. Jack is great with humans but does not seem to care much for cats. He seems to do okay with some dogs. Jack's estimated DOB is 7/4/2019; he weighs approximately 60 pounds.\n\nJack was generously sponsored by Anh Thu Doan during our virtual Reigning Cats and Dogs event. Thank you Anh for sponsoring Jack!\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

In my previous home, I was said to show aggression towards select people, so I can be a bit picky about my human friends. I also get along with some dog friends as long as they are respectful of my space.\n\nEmail PAWS to inquire about me or if you would like more information! :)",

She is learning to walk on a leash and needs a home with a yard until she gets better on leash. She is very loving  of all people and kids that are older, in their teenage years or older. She loves toys, and she really loves to tear toys up! Very affectionate and playful. She enjoys being your side and belly rubs. She is an extremely loyal dog, and would make an amazing companion, as long as you have the patience to teach her that leashes are not so bad.",

Luckily for Snow, she caught the eye of a kind person whom had seen her several times before on the street; this time she decided to take Snow home and get her help. Now Snow is a very loving and smart girl who loves to play with her toys and other dogs. She is a super kind and happy pup and loves hanging out with her doggy pals! Though she's amazing, she has various behavioral concerns that would make her the best fit for an experienced single adult, with the time and resources to address her guarding tendencies with positive reinforcement training. She has been in and out of the shelter several times but hasn't given up hope. She is a girl with a heart of gold who just needs someone to help her be her best self! If that sounds like you, fill out an application to meet her today!",

We have to help her!!\nThe lady\u2019s son found her about 2 weeks ago. They have been calling her Abby. She was dragging a broken rope that was knotted around her neck, the knot was under her chin and bigger than a baseball. Her son had to cut it off her. She looked so bad I couldn't stand it so I took her to the vet. The vet said those are chemical burns on her, God knows from what. She is being treated with antibiotics and some other kind medicine. She is 5 years old and 51 Pounds. She is very sweet and very excited to see people.\nThe vet said she did very good when they examined her besides being a wiggle butt. She needs to be with someone who will love her and show her attention. I doubt she's ever has any.\nShe is begging for a foster to save her and show her what true love means!!\n\nJotform.us/gcurgents/mylo\n\nIf you can\u2019t foster, pledges save lives too!",

            "description": "Roscoe ~ Available...Roscoe is a handsome, fawn and white, male Shepherd mix. He is approximately 8 years old and weighs around 75 pounds. He has a low/moderate energy level and is crate-trained and housebroken.\n\nWhile he may be an older boy, he is very athletic and loves to go for walks and hikes. He has a great balance of being active and ready for outings but is also very calm and relaxed while at home. He is good with older kids and is social with other dogs but has not been cat-tested. Because of his age, he is available for the reduced \"senior\" adoption fee and training fee (see details below).\nFor more information or to request an adoption application, please email us at adoption.mtgsr@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION: Training (for both the dog AND the family) increases the probability of a successful adoption. We feel strongly that training is an essential part of responsible dog ownership and we now require training for every dog placed through the MTGSR program.\n\nRoscoe's total cost of adoption is $250 which includes the $125 senior adoption fee and a training fee (payable to the trainer) of $125 is due at the time of adoption.\n\nFor the adoption fee, the dog will be spayed/neutered, current on all vaccinations, current on heartworm/flea-tick preventatives and microchipped.\n\nThe training fee will include a plan tailored to that specific dog and that dog's needs (obedience training, behavior modification, etc.) and includes two private training sessions.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Our philosophy is \"Rescue locally, place locally\" which means we primarily pull dogs from shelters in the Nashville area AND we place dogs within a one-hour drive of Nashville. If you are outside of the Nashville area, please consider adopting a homeless dog in your local community.",

So far we have learned that he does not know personal space and though is a solid 65 pounds...thinks he is a lapdog. He is wonderful and easy on a leash and has such a sweet demeanor. His goofy personality has won over our volunteer and the vet staff alike. We can't wait for his new family to fall in love too! Guster was impounded at the city shelter after he was running at large and reportedly had an altercation with a dog walking on a leash. He was deemed a potentially dangerous dog (PDD) as a result of the incident. To comply with PDD requirements, we would prefer an out of city limits adopter or foster.",

            "description": "Samson is less than 50lbs with a big personality. Samson lights up whenever his people enter the room, and begins to wiggle and jump excitedly. Samson has only been with the rescue a short time, but quickly showed what a happy, fun guy he is. He is progressing well with his basic deference training, and is able to sit politely to wait for his treat. Samson is not all that interested in fetch, and is content to enjoy his time exploring the yard.\n\nSamson has a good recall and will come to the door promptly when he is called from his  enclosed privacy fence yard. Samson is also doing well with his leash training when he is on walks. He is just an overall happy guy who is waiting for the right family to come along to forever change their lives for the better.\n\nSamson is a neutered, male and is approximately 2 years old (2020). Samson had his life saved thanks to a partner rescue stepping up to pull him the day he was set to be euthanized and care for him until MAPS was able to take Samson into their foster home program. \n\nApplication Process\n\nMAPS\u2019s adoption process is designed to help best place dogs with homes that are in the best interest of the dog and their human companions. The adoption process starts with a prescreen review of a Guardian Application. Making decisions about dog placement in adoptive homes is an \"art\", not a \"science\", and there will be times when applications will be denied for various reason(s). This is left to the discretion of the MAPS after reviewing relevant information. MAPS reserves the right to make all decisions regarding placement or final disposition of any rescued dog in its care into a foster or adoptive home. There is absolutely no guarantee, made or implied, that any person or persons requesting to adopt a dog being fostered through MAPS, or posted on MAP's web site, will be granted an adoption. After a successful prescreen, including background checks, the applicant(s) are notified that they can visit the dogs and a time slot is made for the dog and applicant interaction. After the interaction we encourage several days of reflection before adopting a pet to help assure this will be a lifetime commitment of love and quality care for the dog. Next we conduct a home/neighborhood visit to the Guardian Applicant's home. If the home visit proves successful the new mom and/or dad of the dog will sign an Adoption Agreement and share a lifetime of love and mindful growth !\n\nGuardianship Application available for download at\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/MAPSFiles\n\nMAPS Dog Rescue Mission\n\nMidwest Area Pit Stop, Inc. (MAPS) is a foster home based rescue located in Madison, Wisconsin established in 2005 after being part of the Chicago Illinois based rescue Furry Friends for several years. MAPS focuses on providing a structured, safe calm environment for the dogs in their care that helps them flourish. This structured home environment is complimented by exercise, Positive Reinforcement Deference Training, very high quality dog food in addition to a broad spectrum of proven food supplements including vitamins and supplements. In addition to fostering, MAPS provides sponsorship funds to help with the veterinary expenses and/or Breed DNA testing to save dogs in need of a rescue at the end of their options. MAPS has been active in the community promoting dog safety, how to build a healthy relationship with your dog, and fighting breed discrimination including breed testing of hundreds of dogs since December 2007. MAPS believes that dogs are a central component for people to have a more meaningful and purposeful life. That is, if people are willing to embrace mindfulness in daily living. Dogs help us connect to reality and make life worth living through example and deep bonds. MAPS is not about how many dogs are adopted in the shortest amount of time but rather measures to help insure the dogs that are adopted do not come back for the wrong reasons.\n\n",

            "description": "Zurie is a female Belgian Malinois born July 3, 2019 with megaesophagus. Megaesophagus is a condition effecting the muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Dogs with Megaesophagus cannot have free access to food, treats, or water. They must consume all food while sitting in a Bailey chair and remain upright for 30 minutes after each feeding. Please thoroughly research Megaesophagus before applying to adopt one of our amazing ME dogs. Zurie is all things Malinois . She is very intelligent, always on alert even when she seems relaxed, loyal, protective, and DRIVEN to please her person. She NEEDS a lot of exercise daily and a job to do. She is currently trying her hand at agility and scent work in her foster home. She will fetch balls like a mad man. Zurie is still working on her people skills and takes a bit to warm up but if you can see through the \u201cI\u2019m a scary Malinois\u201d smoke screen she throws up, you may just find the best friend you will ever have. Zurie gets along well with dogs of all sizes. Belgian Malinois experience is a MUST. Apartments, homes with young children/cats, or an applicant without breed experience will not be considered. Zurie will require a 6 ft fenced in yard.\n\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DO NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "ADOPT ME ONLINE: https://ophrescue.org/dogs/4588\n\nMy name is Kalei (Kay-Leigh)! I am a super-social, adorable 5 -year old Labrador/Pit Bull Terrier mix and weigh 45 lbs. \n\nI'm excited to make friends with humans and dogs everywhere I go. I love to go for walks and Im also happy to do yoga with you or coach you through your workout. I know how to snuggle and relax too! If invited, I will curl up with you at night and while watching TV, but I dont usually get on furniture on my own. \n\n I do need some accommodation. I cannot be crated. I am doing really well in a home with a fenced back yard and doggie door, and am looking for a home with those features so I can let myself out to go potty when youre not home. \n\nI would probably be best in a home with dogs close to my size and larger Ive been around kids and I like them too. \n\nI am a great model! I would love my own Instagram. I happily wear clothes and I love toys. My foster says I have personality for days and I will steal your soul with her eyes! \nI am spayed and have had my vaccinations and preventatives! Apply to adopt me today! \n\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

Azeri was clearly used to breed and has had mammary tumors removed as a result of that breeding.\n\nAzzy:\n\nI'm just a big lover who is happy to snuggle with you and give kisses after a busy day playing and running and generally being on the go. Yes, I'm high energy, but not obnoxiously so! I love my walks, am expertly housetrained, and, truth be told, I would prefer to be your only dog.\n\n\"Remember the Carpenter's song \"Close to You?\" Well, that's where I long to be. I simply adore my people, so you can guess that I'll be spending a lot of time on your lap or cuddling in your bed. I do have my own bed that is also a favorite spot (no crate necessary), and I enjoy long walks and an average amount of play and exercise. Other favorite things: eating (in fact I could stand to lose a few) and barking when meeting new dogs/people and to alert you to visitors at the door. I need special food for a urinary condition, and I'll happily use a pee pad. \"\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete the DRSF Online Adoption form.My adoption fee covers all my (prior) vet care (adopter receives vet records). For more information refer to the DRSF Adoption Fee page.If you have any questions about adoption or want more info, you can email: info@dachshundrescuesouthflorida.com 2/2/21 8:31 AM",

Because he loves to play with toys they could be used as an excellent training tool. He is responsive to simple corrections and has great focus on his human. \n\nHe is a wonderful, loving, dedicated companion, and is happy being near his humans, but is quite independent. He enjoys walks and rides in the car (although he is very vocal on car rides). While truly a bull in a China shop, he is a fairly well-mannered, non-destructive gentleman, who will make a great addition to the right home. \n\nTavo has spent most of his time outside in a kennel, but has adjusted nicely to being a house dog! Who wouldnt! He sleeps comfortably all night in his crate, and is settling down in his foster home. \n\nHe will take treats gently most of the time, but might try to snitch one from your hand! Were working on correcting this behavior, and he is learning very fast, as he only wants to please his handler, but caution is a must. \n\nTavo has not been socialized much with other animals, so he might do best as an only dog. He requires a home without cats or other small animals, and because of his size, only an adult home or one with older children will be given consideration.\n\nTavo is a great dog looking for his forever family. He needs people who are willing to devote time to forming a strong, lasting, trust-based bond, offer him a safe, loving environment, and provide ongoing obedience training, based upon positive reinforcement. He is a lot of dog, and only high level experienced adopters who can provide strong leadership and proper management of working breed behavior will be considered. Tavo must be given daily exercise and mental stimulation to expend his energy. He is not an average pet. Are you game??\n\nWe are waiting for your call!",

            "description": "Sadie is a typical border collie, loves to work all the time.  (Some people have said she is a purebred border collie). she is around 40 lbs. She has lots of natural instinct and has been around horses, mules and a few cows.  She does head and heel.  She has had no formal training and to be the best she can be she would need formal training for herding.  She would also make a terrific agility , trick or fly ball dog.  She loves to fetch, but has never had work with a frisbee.  She can jump very high so with a little training she would make a great frisbee player.  She is very smart and picks up things quickly.  Obedience might be a little boring for her.  She loves to be in the house, but does not live in the house.  She is crate trained and loves to ride and is always ready for a trip.  She is a happy dog and loves everyone (has not been around children) and is afraid of the resident cat. She is generally good with other dogs but will do best as an ONLY dog, since she does not interact with other dogs very much.  She is afraid of lighting, thunder, storms, (does not like to go out in the rain) guns, firecrackers and needs to be kept inside  during these occasions.  She was adopted through an animal shelter about 4 years ago and the owner cannot provide enough stimulus to keep her mind active.  If you are looking for a high energy dog who loves to work and learn and you can train or have Sadie trained then you are the person Sadie is looking to spend the rest of her life with.  She is spayed, current on vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped and ready to jump in your arms and give you kisses.  The application and terms of adoption are located at www.dfwcollierescue.org.  When the app and terms of adoption are received a home visit will be scheduled (virtual can be arranged) and references contacted.  The application is geared toward collies but can be applied to any dog.  An adoption fee with Texas sales tax is required. Contact dfwcollierescue@gmail.com or call or text 214-668-5794 if additional info is needed.  Location -1 hour southwest of Ft. Worth, TX.",

I love to play fetch and be active, but I also enjoy snuggling and watching tv and keeping you company. I'm mellow, a GOOD BOY, and want to emotionally connect with you and bring you SMILES every day. I know my basic obedience and I am good in the car. I don't mind my fellow dogs in the world, but my dream is to be the only pup in the house! If you want to meet me and give me a hug and get to know me better, I'm about 80 lbs strong so I need a strong human to handle me on walks and has had experience with my breed. No children bc I'm big and can knock them over.\n\nIf you would like to meet Albert (CP), please complete an application so that one of our volunteers can contact you!\nhttp://www.rrboxerrescue.org/adoption-application.html",

The volunteers there worked their magic and we were able to save her in the nick of time! \n\nDelilah is such a sweet and playful girl and would do so well in any type of environment. She loves being around people and getting spoiled with treats and pets. She is also very smart and already knows how to sit! \n\nDelilah is spayed, fully vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and heartworm negative so she is ready to join her new loving home! \n\nOur adoption process includes an application, a meeting/play date with your future fur baby, a brief home visit, and an adoption fee. Our adoption fees are in place to offset veterinary costs (spaying, neutering, vaccines, deworming, and microchipping) and to ensure our dogs will not be used for dog fighting or any other malicious purposes.",

The owner of the house where they were dumped asked DFW Collie Rescue for help since they did not live there full time and could not help the pair.  We made friends with them and brought them into our care.  Brandy was found to have a microchip and was traced back to an owner who had adopted her from a local animal shelter.  The owner was not willing to  take her back since there was no fenced yard at the home. She can be territorial and needs a fenced in yard.  She is going on 2 years old and loves people and is good with kids and somewhat afraid of cats. She is house trained, crate trained, good on a leash and a good rider. Brandy loves water and loves soaking in the kiddie pool and she loves to go exploring with Butch in the fields and pastures of her foster home and comes when called.  She is not a \"town\" dog as she needs an outlet for her energy.   Brandy and Butch have become favorites at DFW Collie Rescue and they are great friends and love playing together and would make a great pair to adopt together, but not required.  She will not do well with another female dog in the household.  Brandy is spayed, current on vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped.  The adoption application and terms of adoption are located at www.dfwcollierescue.org.  The application is geared toward collies but can apply to any breed.  Once the app and terms of adoption are received a home visit will be scheduled (virtual can be arranged) and references contacted.  An adoption fee is required with Texas sales tax and a small fee to register her microchip.  Contact DFW Collie Rescue at dfwcollierescue@gmail.com or call or text 214-668-5794 if there are questions.",

            "description": "Butch is a catahoula that was dumped in the community where DFW Collie Rescue is located (1 hour southwest of Ft.Worth, TX. ) He was with the little plott hound that is seen in the picture with him.  DFW Collie Rescue was called by the owner of the house where they had been dumped asking for help since they did not live there full time and could not do anything to help the dogs.  We made friends with them and bought them into our care.  He appears to be house trained and is crate trained and a good rider.  Butch is a sweetheart!!!  He loves attention and wants to sit and shake hands so you will give him treats. He is a big guy weighing in about 80 lbs.   He loves water and enjoys sticking his head in the water in a kiddie pool and will  swim in a stock tank if out enjoying a run.  He does love to run in the fields and pastures and hunt, but has not found anything yet.  He was spotted (after being dumped) chasing deer from a deer feeder.  He likes to dig if he smells something so a secure fence will be needed.  He is not a \"town\" dog as he loves the country and the freedom it allows for running, but will need to stay confined in a yard when not under the watchful eye of his owner.  He and Brandy are great friends and would make an excellent couple, but not required for adoption.  Butch is neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped  The application and terms of adoption can be found at www.dfwcollierescue.org.  The app is geared toward collies, but can be applied to any dog.  When the app and terms of adoption are received a home visit will be scheduled (virtual can be arranged) and references contacted.  There is an adoption fee,  Texas sales tax  and a small fee to register his microchip .Butch is a SUPER DOOPER dog and deserves a wonderful forever home.  Call or text 214-668-5794 or email dfwcollierescue@gmail.com if more info is needed..",

He loves nothing more than snuggling with the nearest human and wears a perpetual grin when he is being petted.\n\nHarley also enjoys taking walks and has good leash manners.  He is spending his time at the shelter learning useful behavior cues and loves to perform them when asked.  One of his favorite past times is going for car rides where he settles in the back and enjoys the activities.\n\nHe was surrendered when his owners were unable to take care of him, and they reported that he got along well with their grandchildren.  Harley would be best as the only pet in the house - all the better to claim your full attention!\n\nHarley would make a wonderful companion for a family that would feed him high quality, grain free food and allow him to be the only pet.\n\nDue to Covid, the shelter is  has an appointment only policy. We ask potential adopters to fill out our application, prior to a scheduled meeting. The staff is very accommodating and we welcome any inquires. \n\nThis link will take you to our adoption application.  \nhttps://capemaycountynj.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5814/Adoption-Application\n\n",

After much vet care and tlc, he is doing great now and needs to be maintained on 5 units Vetsulin BID (2x day). He can be a bit quirky with strangers and would be best in a home without small children. He is a big sweet boy otherwise. He needs a minpin experienced home and preferable one with diabetic experience or a strong will to learn and of course one that has the finances necessary to maintain his proper vet care and special diabetic needs. \n***Consideration in the form of a reduced adoption fee for the right home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please cut and paste the link below to fill out an adoption application:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/92916416469165\n\nAfter the application is processed and approved, a home visit and meet and greet with the dogs will be scheduled. If there are any fencing issues, make sure that repairs are done prior to the home visit. MinPins are natural escape artists! Typically, the adoption is finalized the day after the home visit and meet and greet. Out of area adopters would need to drive/fly in to meet the dogs and adopt.",

            "description": "Hi meet Bellagio,\n\nBellagio is a handsome Boxer mix who is about 1 years old and weighs around 55 lbs. He is not your typical boxer, he is high energy and needs an experienced dog owner. Bellagio loves playing with other large dogs and toys but is also an amazing snuggle buddy. He would be best as an only dog as he has a high interest in anything smaller than him. He is a happy go lucky guy, he would love a home that will take him to obedience classes while continuing his socialization. Bellagio wants a person/family who will provide him with a life of mental and physical stimulation while keeping him safe and happy. He is young, so he needs a plan if there are longer workdays, so he is not spending too much time in a crate.\n\nBellagio came to us after being found roaming the streets. He was scanned for a chip but unfortunately none was found. After many attempts to find an owner no one came forth.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you. You can find our application at Lovejoyfoundation.orgYou MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application. We are a Southern California based rescue and do nothing adopt further than an hour from our headquarters in Inglewood, Ca. we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

            "description": "Dayzee is looking for that special family to call her own! She came to Dirt Road Doggies Rescue with a litter of puppies who have all been adopted. Dayzee is still a puppy at heart and often gets the \"zoomies\" and loves playing with her toys. She can be quite the comedian, and does well on a leash. Dayzee is house and crate trained and enjoys going for rides. She prefers male dog friends who like rough play and wrestling, but only after slow introductions. She easily loves all women and children, but likes to get to know the man of the house at her own pace. New men coming in the home stresses her out, so she would prefer to have her own space to get away. Dayzee is a medium sized gal at around 40-45lbs. Meet her today: https://petlover.petstablished.com/pets/public/716013",

It\u2019s not a requirement but a definite plus. Aside from being playful he also understands basic commands and once he is comfortable with his person, he loves to cuddle and be held like a baby. Now he just needs a well-balanced home that can give him structure and just the right amount of love. He is a total breeeeze when on walks with his current foster too.\n\nSpicy Burrito is overall an independent and confident little boy and is house trained. He will try to take over the household though and has some resource guarding issues (that\u2019s the spicy part); so he needs an experienced owner who can give him structure and boundaries when it comes to being on furniture and with food. Spicy is not a fan of children either so given that along with his resource guarding issues and tendency to be a little unpredictable, he needs an adult only household please. No kids.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

He comes with a few free training lessons to help you transition. He is dog friendly and would need a secure crate or a dog run (you can buy one at Lowe's) at the beginning so that he can understand he is on a schedule. Harper is protective over his humans so you have to be sure to introduce new people slowly and not just let a bunch of people barge into your home that he has never met. He is easy to walk, knows sit, down, and stay. Harper is a very loving boy, but he can be weary of men. Harpers ideal family would consist of only females, he loves the ladies! He is an extremely loyal dog that will always follow you and protect you. He loves to be by your side and loves to get his butt scratched! Harper is really an amazing boy that just needs someone that is going to love him and continue to teach him how to be the best dog he can be. That being said, Harper needs a strong handler and someone who has owned a large dog or pit-bull before and is able to handle him. \n",

A cage with wire floor 24/7! Nala's took this sweet girl, let her relax, have fun, enjoy play time and cuddle time, and she is now ready for adoption! She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped. Basil loves to play with other dogs and is great with people and kids. She is so happy at our ranch and is hoping for a forever home of her own. We are not sure of her age but our veterinarian estimates between 2 and 3 and she weighs 38 pounds. Basil appreciates every minute of being loved and cared for and will make someone a wonderful companion or family dog.\n\nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 30 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to ensure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Lola is a very sweet girl. She can be a little dominant but she gets along well with other dogs. She is approximately 4 years old and a little girl at 39lbs.  She came to us with very bad ear infections so they will need extra care her whole life. She also will need daily eye medication. She is very curious about everything and will chew things she is not supposed to. She is crate trained and still working on being potty trained. She is very active and playful. She loves to snuggle on the couch but has very curious puppy behaviors. \n\nUpdate: Lola is having surgery in December and will need a few months to heal from that. Hopefully she heals great and will be available after that.\n\nIf you are interested in Lola, please visit our website: www.ilenglishbulldogrescue.org, and read through our adoption criteria to see if you meet our requirements. If you do, please fill out an application to adopt.\n\nLola's adoption fee is: $700.00\n\nVisit us on Facebook: Visit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IllinoisEnglishBulldogRescue \n",

You can always find her carrying around her stuffy in her mouth. \nTymberr loves human attention so much, that she would prefer to be the only pet in the home. But do not let that stop you from our girl! She is such a snuggle bug that you would not need another dog, she will be enough dog to fill your heart. \n\nTymberr prides herself on being super agile. Because of this, she requires a 6 foot fence so she can not show off her hurdle skills or someone who can keep her on a long lead for potty breaks. \n\nYou can apply for our sweet girl at www.allpawssafehaven.com",

When we got him, he was heartworm positive, but he went through the treatment and is now completely heartworm free.\n\nMax does not particularly like going for car rides, he tends to whine the entire time. Now, that might change if he could be harnessed in the front seat where he can see you. He has healed from an old injury that causes him to favor one leg, but it honestly doesn't slow him down.

At only 1 year old, this English Mastiff lady has already been rescued from a hoarding situation, spent time at a local SPCA, adopted out, and then surrendered to BDHP because they were unable to provide her with what she needed to be successful. Stella is understandably confused by all the changes, and without much love as a pup, a little behind in confidence and maturity. She is a typical puppy that like to chew and dig on occasion, adores beef-flavored Nylabones - who doesn't love beef, right - and is eager to please. Stella is house trained, good with other dogs w/proper intros, knows the commands sit and stay, and loves a nap on the couch & car rides. Her foster family will continue her education towards being an awesome house dog through crate training, further obedience, socialization and environmental management. Because of her history, Stella does have some barrier and leash reactivity, but BDHP will do everything we can to help her feel less stressed. She would do best in a behavior savvy home with a 6 foot privacy fence. Stella cannot wait to get adopted and she hopes it'll happen soon. Please think about giving this girl a safe, happy, and patient home to call her own forever.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

She's a boxer/pitbull mix, about 3 years old. She's a unique soul who responds well to kindness, love and a strong leader.\nShe came to Rescue two and a half years ago. She was a scared little girl and she is still quite worried about new people. You can imagine how difficult it is for her to make a good impression when adopters come to meet her. If only they could watch a nanny cam to see how sweet and cuddly she is with my 15 year old! She loves to snuggle under the blanket and get as close as she can get.\nAn ideal adopter would have a small, quiet household with no small children. Jada likes dog friends but we've ONLY done slow, careful introductions. She adores rough housing with her dog pal, Sadie. Sadie was just adopted and Jada misses her. She's so happy that I go outside with her! A fenced in yard right off the house is a must for Jada, just so she doesn't have to worry about strange humans or dogs. When company comes over, she will be happy to have some \"Me Time\" in her kennel, gnawing on a bone.\nJada is not a dog that fits every family. However, she IS a good girl and I know there's a home that is perfect for her. When we find them, they'll know how blessed they are.\nIf you fit the bill and want to share the love, apply at emotionalrescuemn.org.",

He likes to play with his doggie buddies and seeks attention from his people. He is house trained and would enjoy hanging out with you on hot summer days and cold winter nights. So if you want to adopt a Shar Pei named after the most popular alcohol in China, then Baujiu fits the bill. Adopt him and he will be the most popular character in your house.",

He has come a long way and will now walk on a leash, but many things still scare him.  He is scared of doorways and will flip out if expected to go through one.  A lot of patient coaxing and understanding is needed to socialize Don, but he will be awesome once he understands our world.  Though Don is very handsome, he is not for a first time dog owner, but will need someone that understands training and socialization.  He will need a fenced yard to keep him safe, and might do better with a very social well-mannered, well-trained dog companion to show him the ropes.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations. If you would like an adoption application, please send an email message to adoptprebleco@yahoo.com",

She is a very sweet and incredibly smart dog that is determined to please. Playing with toys, fetch, tug and going for walks are her favorite things to do. Dotty learned over 10 commands in about 6 months with her previous owner. She would make a great companion for someone looking to get into Flyball, disc, or agility training. \n\nDotty is extremely food motivated and just needs reinforcement with her known commands and needs an active family. She is crate trained and house trained. She is fine with cats, small and large dogs and would love to have a playmate. New situations and people make her nervous so you must be willing to give her time to adjust. Usually with a few treats and a little time she is ready to play and show you how smart she is. She would not be good with young children (which is why she had to be returned to us), so will not be adopted out to a family with young kids. \n\n\nDue to COVID-19 we are a little more limited on volunteers and the availability (and safety) of home visits.   \n\nTherefore, at this time, we will only be able to process applications that have an excellent current vet history.  If you haven\u2019t had a pet or verifiable vet history we will not be able to process your application.   \n\nWe will be reviewing applications and contacting applicants that we are able to process applications for and that meet the vet history requirements as well as being a good fit for the dog(s) that they are interested in.   \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO:\n\n\nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Basic Bloodwork\n- Urinalysis\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on Flea preventive\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $250\n\n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter. \n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

She is very, very shy and extremely cautious all the time but she is a super easy dog to have and is precious. She is possibly perfect for an older person or someone that lives in an apartment. She has to be forced on walks, but once outside she likes to explore and smell things, but stays very close to her human.\n\nSophia is heartworm positive and currently undergoing the slow-kill treatment which is provided by the rescue.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Sophia or possibly adopt her, please fill out an application at www.hhfrescue.org.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

Unfortunately, she is overweight and would benefit from a workout plan. She came in at 92 lbs. We are working on it, and she's doing well! In her former home, she lived with a small child and a cat. Around both of them, Pookie was gentle, relaxed, and playful. She is currently in a foster home with an adult and adores being the center of attention! \n\nPookie is housebroken, very smart,and super sweet. This big girl walks well on leash and great at her basic commands. You will never be lonely with our girl. She loves nothing more than to sit arm in arm with you and enjoy people watching and the sunshine. Pookie is really the perfect picnic buddy! Don\u2019t let her age fool you! Pookie is friendly and playful. Show her a plastic bottle, and watch the fireworks in her eyes sparkle! Pookie is down for anything and just really can't wait for her forever home. She will keep you forever entertained. Did you know one of her favorite treats is cat food? Silly girl!  \n\nShe never lived with another dog, but does not appear to be a big fan of their company. For this reason, Pookie asks to be the only dog in the home. \n\nIf interested in adopting, email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. Please note that due to an email glitch, sometimes emails get lost. We respond to all emails! So, If you do not hear from us, please follow up! \n\n\n",

            "description": "Storm is a sweet chonky lady of a certain age who has spent some time in the PACC clinic and was recently diagnosed with Diabetes. But, as we know from the great Wilford Brimley, the beetus is a very manageable condition! Storm was housebroken in her former home and her prior owners described her as a very sweet girl who loves belly rubs. Storm also previously lived with children, growing up alongside a small child from the time she was a puppy herself. In playgroup at the shelter, Storm was easygoing and even a wee bit playful with the other dogs, and really likes taking a dip in the pool. She mostly did her own thing- she is 9 after all! Storm's foster says: Storm is housetrained and does great with my other dog. Her family gave her to the shelter to be euthanized due to old age though she had undiagnosed diabetes and arthritis that could be treated to improve quality of life. She loves tennis balls and is huge on affection and asking for pets. Again, she's an old lady so she has to take breaks but she loves to play. She just wants someone to love her and have a place to rest her old bones in her last few years. She has so much love left to give and will always make you laugh with her quirky behaviors. She is loving and full of life. She bounces around when you get home and is constantly following you around to lay in your lap. Her playful demeanor and snorting are my favorite behaviors. She is a beautiful color and has striking eyes. She is fairly easy to handle and would be happy in any household that understands she's an old gal with a few health issues. She LOVES her kiddie pool and loves to be outside though she overheats very quickly. She is absolutely worth adopting and I am confident she would bring any family so much joy and happiness.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: GPMR communicates primarily by email. If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\n***Rook's adoption fee is waived!***Meet Rook! Rook was found as a stray and ended up in a TX shelter. He was pulled just before his time was up there. Rook was a little scared in the shelter but once we got him out of there, he is a totally different dog! He loves to run and play with the other Mastiff in his foster home. His foster mom has worked a lot with him, he's perfectly house trained and crate trained! She's also been working on basic obedience training.Rook is estimated at 5 to 6 years old. He is a gorgeous Apricot boy. Like many of our rescues, he tested positive for heartworms and has completed treatment, has tested negative for heartworms and is ready for adoption! He weighs 115 pounds.Rook is a super sweet boy and an easy keeper in a house that has a routine-oriented famly! However he doesn't like changes in his routine and that can cause him some anxiety. For example his foster mom went out of town and had a petsitter while she was gone. He did great for the petsitter, but started a bit of pacing and panting for a couple of days after his foster mom returned. We've started him on an inexpensive anxiety medication that he takes once a day and it's really helped with things like vet visits, he doesn't get as nervous with those now. Rook's ideal home would be one that is very routine oriented and whose family doesn't travel a whole lot. He doesn't do well in boarding situations and would need a petsitter while his family is out of town.We would prefer an adult only home for Rook as the busy behavior of kids would probably be too much for him to handle. He likes a quiet home without much change! His adopter will need to understand that he'll have some extra anxiety during the rehoming process and be patient to allow him time to adjust to his new routine while he settles into a new home. He loves to play with other dogs and so we would love a home that has a canine companion for him. Recently Rook has experienced occassional back pain when he plays to hard with the other Mastiffs in his foster home. He was evaluated by the vet including Xrays and they didn't find a cause for it, so they prescribed muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories to give as needed to manage that.Rook is being fostered near DFW, TX.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

But, we love her as she is, chunk and all! This girl is happy to be your mellow couch potato/hippo/brown bear or a park buddy! Nena is just adorable and full of surprises. Initially, when you meet Nena, she can be shy and asks you approach her slowly- or ignore her. In no time, she starts to love you and will quietly rest at your person\u2019s feet, enjoying affectionate petting. Once you are in her circle of trust, Nena has no boundaries on the love you give her. She is happy to play dress up with you and strike the fiercest pose! \n\nShow her a tennis ball, and Nena morphs into a bouncing tiger. Where that agility comes from, we still don\u2019t know! Her entire body will wiggle in motion while she runs and jumps to play.  Watching her do this on those adorable short legs will leave you rolling in laughter. This little low rider can really move, when she is motivated!\n\nThis comedian will steal your heart and earn every treat you give her. Nena is a lovely senior gal, both active and friendly. She will thrive in her forever home as an only pet or with a laid back, calm pooch. Adult only homes or those with children that will give her the slower approach she needs would be ideal! She finds stairs a bit difficult, but loves apartment or suburban life. Elevator buildings or a home with one level/minimal stairs would be best. This is a lot of brindle bear to take up the steps! \n\nWe rescued Nena from the city shelter. She had skin and ear infections, which are now treated and resolved. \n\nIf interested in adopting, email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. Please note that due to an email glitch, sometimes emails get lost. We respond to all emails! So, If you do not hear from us, please follow up! \n\n",

            "description": "Meet Katrina, a beautiful four-year-old American Bulldog mix who would love nothing more than to spend her Thanksgiving holiday with a family she can call her own.\n\nShe is 71 pounds of delightfulness! And oh, my - those perky ears! With ears like that, Katrina must be a great listener and will probably hang on to your every word with intense interest as you talk sweetly to her. She is very bright, is a quick learner and makes excellent eye contact while learning commands. She is highly motivated by treats, so that makes her training sessions fun!\n\nKatrina needs to be the only pet in the home because she is not a fan of other dogs or cats, She is calm and affectionate with adults and wants to please them. It is unknown how she reacts to children because she has not been around them, so she would need to meet your children to ensure she would be okay with them. Ideally, Katrina needs a home with a fenced-in yard, but if your yard isn't fenced in, she would need to be on leash when she is outside the house.\n\nIf you would like to be Katrina's hero, contact HSBR at (706) 632-4357 to schedule a meet and greet with her. You won't find a more loyal and loving companion.",

            "description": "Our Rockers Rescue pets are currently in foster homes that help us save lives. When you choose to adopt from a rescue, you help open space for us to save another life in need. We are located around Shreveport, Louisiana. Thank you for considering adoption!\n\n***** This is a special needs pet******* Read full bio.\n\nKirby, female, around1 yr old, around 30lbs. VERY sweet and outgoing. Has special food needs. Megaesophagus, information below. She has to eat her food in a doggie highchair. Has many fans on our facebook page******* We will first explain her medical, then explain her great personality.\n\nHistory\n\n:\n\nKirby was found when she was around 5lbs and 6 weeks old, and brought to a local shelter that has to euthanize for space. They could tell she was sick and did not want her to stay the weekend there and possibly suffer, so they put out a plea for rescue to save her or they would have to euthanize her at the end of the day. One of our great foster families saw her being networked online and reached out to us to let us know that they wanted to save her. With just hours before she was set to die, Kirby was saved and got to become a Rockers Rescue puppy.\n\nKirby quickly began showing problems by throwing up. Us along with our vet team were working hard to try to figure out what was going on. It was discovered that she had Puppy Strangles and Megaesophagus at the time.\n\nTo break those down, Puppy Strangles is basically an autoimmune disease where the body is attacking itself. Her face was hairless and flaky around the eyes and she had patches of fur missing. You will notice this in her baby pictures. The Puppy Strangles was treatable though and she overcame them. They are now gone for good but have left tiny little freckles on her body where you may notice some missing fur. Just a reminder of the journey this sweet baby has been through.\n\nNow, on to the Megaesophagus (Mega-esophagus). This is where a dog cannot swallow their food normally like other dogs do. The esophagus does not function properly so the food needs gravity to fall down the throat. That means the dog needs to sit in an upright position when eating. Most mega-e babies get to eat their food in a cute little doggy high chair. This chair is also known as a Bailey Chair. Now some owners use different methods to go about feeding, but we have raised Kirby to eat in her Bailey Chairs. Some mega-e dogs have to sit in their chair for a set amount of time after eating, but Kirby has graduated from that and is now free to go about her day as soon as she finished her food. Some dogs do grow out of this condition or find themselves handling it better with time as they grow. Kirby has been showing great improvement with time.\n\nWhat does Kirby get to eat? Right now Kirby currently is fed a nice brand of hard food that is soaked in water. She gets to eat this in her bailey chair at least twice a day. She currently gets a medicine called Sildenafil. It costs around $30 for 3 months. This medicine aids in keeping food down and is bought through a veterinary clinic. It is placed in her food and she eats it easily. Foster mom finds the whole routine of feeding Kirby to be very simple and easy. We don't want anyone to feel like it is a huge overwhelming situation because it is really pretty easy and straightforward. Any potential adopter would have meets with Kirby and foster mom and get lots of advice and support from our rescue. We are family for Kirby. I also want to mention that we found Kirby to be born without hip sockets. It does not affect her, but surgery down the road would be an option if it ever did affect her (they would do femoral head removal so the top of the bones wouldnt be poking her.) Again, unnecessary right now in her life. We can just say she has weird bones/joints. This is a special dog. Please help us find her a special family to love her. <3\n\nKirby Personality: Kirby loves to cuddle in bed and on couches. She will sit right on you or get as close to you as she can. She is a playful puppy, she loves toys and will bark at her dog friends wanting them to play with her. She loves running around a fenced yard and hunting for bugs and sticks. We don't let her play tug-o-war anymore because her hips are sensitive and she is hard core at playing that game. She will play it up with hard toys though and bouncing around with dog friends. Kirby is smart and knows when its food time. She happily eats in her bailey chair and can even be left alone in it, miss independent. She loves to play hard then rest hard. She is very affectionate. Also...let's mention those stellar ear satellites she has! Her ears are huge. Kirby is all around the precious baby of our rescue right now. She is loved and adored by many. Kirby WILL have to take time to warm up to her new people. That will require understanding and dedication.\n\nP.S. Kirby is one of our special pets that has her own coloring sheet! We added it to the photos. She is helping educate children. We had quite a few people color her picture and send in to us! SO cute and awesome.\n\nRequirements/Needs: Requirements for Kirby's future awesome family. Must have a fenced yard. Allow Kirby on furniture and in bed. She is not kenneled when home alone, she is good with free roaming. NO young children in the home (small toys, dropping food, etc) She would thrive best with a dog friend due to her hyper playful tendencies. Ability to afford medicine. Being more local to Shreveport areas is a positive to help with transition into new home. Lots of love!\n\nVetting:\n\nKirby is up to date on yearly vaccinations and rabies vaccine. Spayed. She had a negative heartworm test and is on monthly heartworm prevention. Fecal exam. On monthly flea/tick prevention. Microchipped via PetLink (lifetime registration with no fees) Kirby had lots of vet care when she was smaller. Vet history is required in order to adopt Kirby, that means any previous or current pets you have should have a good vet record with your veterinary clinic.\n\nAbout Applying to Adopt:\nANY questions just ask! You can message us on facebook or through rockersrescue@gmail.com This pup has a $50 adoption donation fee This fee generally NEVER covers how much we actually spend on the animal. We are a 501c3 non profit so the fee goes back into our volunteer rescue to help us save more lives. We function solely on donations. Go to www.rockersrescue.org/info/adoption to apply for adoption. Try to include as much about yourself as possible.",
