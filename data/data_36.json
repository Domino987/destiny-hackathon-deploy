            "description": "Nikki is a bit of a mystery when it comes to her breed.  We were told she is a Weimaraner mix, but other than her beautiful rich grey coat, it is hard to know for sure.  She was born May 17, 2019 and weighs only about 40 pounds.  Nikki loves attention but is a little timid with new people and situations.  She just needs a little time to feel secure.  Nikki needs an adult home as she is not used to children. She has been around other dogs her size and smaller.  I do not believe she has ever been around cats.  Nikki is highly intelligent and willing to learn, but she needs a loving home with someone who is patient and loving.  She will do best with a fenced yard to run and play under supervision.  According to her previous owner, she walks good on lead and is housebroken.  Nikki is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, microchipped, and crate trained.  If Nikki looks like a perfect fit for you, please fill out an adoption application at humanesocietycitrus.com and for additional information contact Karron at choose2rescue@hotmail.com or at 352-586-9699.  The adoption donation for Nikki is $200.00",

In addition to being completely emaciated and having an upper respiratory infection, she had SEVERE skin infections (both yeast and bacteria). Everywhere you touched there was scabs and pustules, and her skin was solid black and scaly-looking.  With the right medicine and a consistent, healthy diet, her skin has improved.\n \nShe is pure perfection - she\u2019s completely potty trained, she\u2019s quiet, calm, super gentle & submissive and incredibly sweet.  She doesn't let her age slow her down! She\u2019s still bouncy & playful and has quite the zest for life! She will need to be on meds for life for her arthritis and will need to be on meds for the foreseeable future for her skin (anti-fungal and steroid) - so any prospective adopter has to be ok with this.\n \nSophia loves going outside, loves playing with small dogs, loves toys, and loves watching squirrels out the window. She is also cat-friendly.  She is very timid and will take a while to get comfortable so she needs a patient family who will give her the time and space to feel comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped! Our adoption fee is $350\n\n**We only adopt to families in/around Atlanta, Ga (about a 1-2 hour perimeter)**\n\nWe do not monitor our Petfinder email address so if you are interested in any of our dogs, please visit releashatlanta.com to either view more of their profile or to apply! If you have questions, please email adopt@releashatlanta.com \n\nTake a moment and like our Facebook Page for updates on our dogs and the first look at dogs coming into the program! www.facebook.com/releashatlanta\n\nThank you!!",

She is just a pup herself at just a little over a year old. Sabina is lanky. She won't grow much more but might fill out a little bit. She is a German Shepherd. Sabrina is in am amazing foster home. She is being taught about everyday things that city dwellers do. She is loving it! Sabrina hadn't been exposed to much. She is a little on the shy side but don't let that fool you, she comes around for snuggles very quickly! She is learning lots from her foster fur siblings, like house manners & outdoor potty & is doing famously! She likes to go on walks with her foster family. Sabrina is learning the a crate can be safe but it's taking her a bit to get there. She wants to be with her people, so we suggest a home that can leave her out in the home the majority of the time is best; a family that is home often. Sabrina is meeting children & has shown no aggression towards them. We aren't sure how she does with cats but we can cat test her for anyone with a cat.\n\nInterested? Please visit https://dogsbydebin.com/adoption-application/ to complete our quick online adoption application. Sabrina's adoption fee is $225 & includes: Spay, vaccines, microchip, deworming. Thank you!",

            "description": "Meet Jack !!! Jack was rescued from a very overcrowded shelter in SC.  He and his sister were found wondering the streets.  Once at the shelter they were so frightened the hid in the back of the kennel trying so hard to disappear. So when asked if we could save them how could we say no.  The fearful dogs never get adopted.  Since coming to NY both Jack and his sister Jill have learned that not all people are bad.  Jill has been adopted but Jack is still waiting for his happily ever after. Jack is a little weary of people until he knows you are not going to hurt him then he is just a love.  He needs a patient owner that wants to take the time to show him the world is not a scary place and not everyone is going to hurt him..\n\nJack is a year old.  UTD on shots.  Neutered and microchipped.  If you would like to meet this beautiful little boy please go to our website www.snarrnortheast.org and fill out an application\n\nIMPORTANT: This puppy has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choicej on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

            "description": "*INQUIRIES SENT THROUGH PETFINDER WILL NOT BE ANSWERED AS WE DO NOT HAVE THE MANPOWER TO RESPOND TO THEM. PLEASE COMPLETE OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION INSTEAD*\n\nMeet Handsome Huck!\nHuck-TX is in an IDOG foster home in Taylor, TX \u2013 35 minutes outside of Austin. Please read ALL the information in his listing before applying for him. If you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for him, please complete our adoption application at http://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application (copy/paste the URL into your browser). If you have completed an application in the last 3 months and meet the requirements for his new home, you can email us at rescue@idogrescue.com and let us know you are interested in him.\n\nWe will review your application and let you know if you made our short list of applicants. We base our adoption decisions on what is in the best interest of our dogs. Please note our adoption policies are in place for the safety and welfare of our dogs - your understanding is appreciated.\n\nWe are all volunteers and have jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner. We believe in taking time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the best fit for that dog. \n\nOur adoption process may take 2-4 weeks. \n\u2022\tYou must be approved to adopt before we will schedule a meet and greet. \n\u2022\tWe expect approved adopters to visit Huck in his foster home within a short period of time of being approved to adopt him. \n\u2022\tOur adoption process involves vet and personal reference checks, phone interviews, a home visit, an adoption contract and an adoption fee.\n\n*AGE: 2 years (born January 2019)\n\n*WEIGHT: 83 lbs.\n\n*FENCE REQUIREMENT: A physical secure fence of at least 5' is required. No electronic fence or e-collar will be allowed as we feel this would not set him up for success.\n\n*COAT TYPE: straighter moderate shedding hair coat similar to a Labrador. His new family should be prepared to brush his coat regularly and have him groomed every few months. This is approximately $100 per groom.\n\n*ENERGY LEVEL:  Active, high energy. He must receive a minimum of 2-3 walks/runs a day. He wants to get out and run, whether this is as a running partner\u2026 playing fetch\u2026 taking walks.  \n\n*DOGS: he loves other dogs but due to his size and strength he may be too much for some dogs. He is sweet guy and an in-your-face powerful linebacker kind of a guy.\n\n*CATS: unknown. Due to his lack of exposure to cats we will not place him in a home with cats in order to set him up for success.\n \n*KIDS: 14+ years old. Huck is a typical x-large Doodle and is easily excitable. He can accidentally knock you over trying to lick you and will put his paws on your shoulder. He can be mouthy trying to get your attention. We recommend a dog-savvy home with kids 14+ who are familiar with large dog behavior, not afraid of a large dog\u2019s size and energy and are OK being jumped on and mouthed and may be accidentally knocked down.\n \n*CAR:  Rides fine in a car.  \n \n*CRATE:  yes but hasn\u2019t been in crate in his foster home. He was crated in his first home when his owners left the home for brief periods of time. He would not enjoy being crated for long periods of time and would much rather be out and about and running and getting exercise. He enjoys being next to his family.\n  \n*HOUSE TRAINED: Yes! \n\n*LEASH:  Walks fine on a leash.  Given his large size and young age, we would recommend a harness to allow for more control in the event something interesting crosses his path.\n\nHere's what Huck-TX\u2019s foster parents had to say about him:\n\nHuck AKA Huckleberry is a 2 year old male 86 lb. F1 Labradoodle who was surrendered to IDOG by his family. They loved him very much and surrendered him to IDOG due to the owner\u2019s health issues. They wanted him to find an active home where he could get more exercise.\n\nHuck is super sweet, loving and playful\u2026he is a large lapdog at 83 lbs. and strong \u2013 think  linebacker. He will nudge you for love and attention. He is a loyal and affectionate co-worker and will lay at your feet after he gets his energy expended. \n\nHe loves to play and snuggle! He aims to please his person.  He is a big dog and families that are familiar with or can appreciate this fact will find that he is absolutely an amazing dog.  He loves to play, loves people (lap dog, will come for affection and pets and generally wants to be in close proximity) and is very smart. He is a wonderful co-worker and does fine with voices on conference calls, doesn\u2019t bark\u2026 but does need breaks to enjoy a little activity. \n\nHe needs a house that has a fenced yard to ensure that he is getting the daily exercise he needs and craves. He also needs to be walked/run at least twice a day and throw in a few games of fetch and football and he is happy.  When he plays he has the cutest tigger bounce into downward dog \u2013 and he has the cutest personality.\n\nHe would do best with a family that enjoys having a big dog. A family that enjoys a lap dog and an active partner would be ideal.  Someone who is OK with dog hair on their clothes as he sheds similarly to a long-haired Lab.\n\nHuck is well-behaved and listens to the commands he has learned. He will need continued training  - he is very sweet but a bit stubborn and it will take consistency. He needs to continue working on these issues: not jumping up on people, taking treats gently, and not using his mouth to grab you for attention. His jumping can be hard if a person is not ready or stabilized. He is a wonderful dog and his issues can be addressed with continued training.\n\n ****The type of home where we feel Huck would be most successful:*** \n-Family with experience with large energetic dogs who will commit to go through training with him to ensure he becomes the best dog\n-Kids 14+ who are acclimated to living with large mouthy jumpy energetic dogs\n-Fenced yard - privacy fence at least 5' high\n-Family who is willing to ensure he gets his energy expended in the form of physical and mental exercise\n\nHuck is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, house and crate trained. He is heartworm negative and on heartworm/flea and tick preventatives.\n\nIDOG will hold a $150 refundable training deposit to encourage Huck\u2019s new family to go through training with him to help him be successful in his new home. Since 2006, IDOG has been working with rescue dogs and we have found that when an adopted dog goes through training with its new family it strengthens their bond and gives the adopted dog more confidence and security. The training deposit will be refunded upon proof of training classes.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $375 + $150 refundable training deposit to be refunded upon proof of training classes\n\nOUR ADOPTION FEES RANGE FROM $100 - $750 depending on the dog. The following is a general guide, but each dog is assessed individually. It currently costs IDOG an average of over $400 for basic vet, grooming, and foster care on each dog; that does not allow for the ones who get sick, need surgery, have special needs, or are heartworm positive.\n\nADOPTION FEES:\nUnder 6 months $550 and up\n6 months to 2 years $450 and up\n2 years - 4 years $350 and up\n4 years + $100 and up\nSpecial Needs fee/donation assessed on individual basis\n\nTO APPLY FOR THIS DOG, PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE:\nhttp://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n",

She loves playing, but isn\u2019t high energy and would like a doggy playmate if possible. No children though, because they make her nervous.\n \nShe really likes sleeping under the covers and is always first to bed. Mollie is super fast and loves to run in circles. A fenced yard would probably be best for her. She gives the best kisses and is very affectionate once she gets to know you.\n \nShe\u2019s not completely housebroken, but will use pee pads!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped! Our adoption fee is $350\n\n**We only adopt to families in/around Atlanta, Ga (about a 1-2 hour perimeter)**\n\nWe do not monitor our Petfinder email address so if you are interested in any of our dogs, please visit releashatlanta.com to either view more of their profile or to apply! If you have questions, please email adopt@releashatlanta.com \n\nTake a moment and like our Facebook Page for updates on our dogs and the first look at dogs coming into the program! www.facebook.com/releashatlanta\n\nThank you!!",

I was rescued in such an emaciated state I could barely hold my head up. I gained weight and went through patella surgery for my bad knee. I was awaiting clearance so I could have my second knee done when symptoms caused me to have an MRI. Sad to say I have a degenerative metabolic brain disease. This will greatly shorten my life. I am still searching for my happy ever until.. place where I will have love, soft couches, and good food until.. I don\u2019t know how long I have, it can be months or years. I do seem to be holding steady right now. I am such a happy, loving and goofy guy. I am just praying my luck will change and I will be blessed with the bestest home ever? ?? Chopper\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped! Our adoption fee is $350\n\n**We only adopt to families in/around Atlanta, Ga (about a 1-2 hour perimeter)**\n\nWe do not monitor our Petfinder email address so if you are interested in any of our dogs, please visit releashatlanta.com to either view more of their profile or to apply! If you have questions, please email adopt@releashatlanta.com \n\nTake a moment and like our Facebook Page for updates on our dogs and the first look at dogs coming into the program! www.facebook.com/releashatlanta\n\nThank you!!",

Gracie is a 10 year old, 12 lb purebred Cockapoo who is slowly adjusting to her new routine. Gracie is very sweet, but a little reserved when first meeting new people. She warms up very quickly and loves to cuddle and settle in for TV time or a cozy nap.\n\n Gracie walks well on leash and is potty trained in her foster home. Gracie has spent most of her life with two other dogs, so we will be placing her into a home that has one other dog that she can bond with. \n\nThe ideal home for Gracie would be one that understands the ongoing grooming requirements for the Cockapoo breed. A secure yard and a family that is home more often than not would work best. Gracie will come fully vetted which includes a dental. She will just need a low key home that can help her feel confident and safe. No apartments and no small kids please. \n\nGracie's adoption fee is $350 which includes her spay, microchip, vaccines current, deworming, flea treatment, grooming and a dental.

The owner stated that with the difficulties of the pandemic, that he could not keep them even though he had had them since they were pups. When we heard this it broke our hearts knowing that they went from the only home they knew since they were puppies, to a scary windowless run in the shelter. The shelter staff said that Brock was friendly and well tempered. When we got there to see him, he just wiggled his bottom constantly and wanted pets and attention. While we had him out he met a pit bull that was walking by and he was great. He did not growl or bark, but just wiggled his bottom more and went up to greet the other dog. He rode great in the car to the doggy boarding facility where we took him, but a couple times just wanted to get in the driver's lap and get attention.\n\nBrock is a big boy and weighs close to 100 pounds, but he is not overweight. Brock is just a big ball of sweetness. He's about 3 years old. When you look at Brock's pictures, you will notice some patches of bright white fur on him. We haven't had him checked out by our vet yet (he's going next week), but it looks like he has vitiligo. This is not a problem and will not affect him in any way, other than making him look unique. Please give this handsome, and unique looking, boy the home that he wants so bad - forever.\n\nTina has already landed a fabulous new home so now it's Brock's turn! Let's get him out of boarding and back into a home! Please complete an app at www.scoutshonor.org.",

Please email 1-2 days before the event, as some animals are placed during the week and our list is constantly changing.\nFor a list of upcoming pet adoption events go to: www.OscarAnimalRescue.org\n\nOne Step Closer Animal Rescue is a 501c3 non-profit organization.

She is a very shy dog , but very sweet and friendly and ready for her forever family soon.

This covers her spay, Microchip, vaccines including (rabies, parvo/distemper amd bordatella), heartworm test, deworming and flea/tick prevention as well as heartworm prevention. \n\nIf you are interested in Willow, apply at www.lifehouse.petfinder.com, For questions text or call Holly at 615-310-5996.

This is an impoverished area where most dogs have typically only known life outdoors, so expect some adjustment time  to life in a home (although most adapt quickly to the comfort and safety of a home).\nAll puppies have limited training and will need an adopter who teaches them the correct way to interact with the world. Our \u201crez dogs\u201d  are mixed breeds and we can never guarantee their heritage, so we say they \u201clook like\u201d or \u201chave traits like\u201d, to give our best estimates. But honestly, your guess is as good as ours! We can also only guess at what their weight will be when they are full grown. For this reason, we expect adopters to be flexible in their expectations of size and appearance when adopting a puppy. What we do know is that these animals are very smart, make wonderful companions, and are truly grateful and loyal to their rescuers\n",

It does not cause her any discomfort and she walks without any problems.  Please help Lila find the loving home she deserves.\n\nWe do NOT ship our animals. All adoptive families must travel to us to meet their adoptive dog/cat. Applicants must live within a 2 hour radius from Sparta/Andover (07871/07821).\n\nPlease understand that we are an animal shelter and thus unable to say whether the dogs are housebroken as they are not in homes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to please submit an application on our website today so that we can try and process and pre-approve any potential adopters prior to our next adoption event.\n\nPLEASE USE THIS LINK TO SUBMIT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.

Like many livestock guardians, Maya apprently had inadequate containment, got out, and was runnign stray.  She has been in foster long enough to gain back her weight, her trust, and her joie de vivre.  She never stopped loving people and other dogs.\n\nMaya would like to be petted all the time, please -- don't stop!  She is playful and lively with other dogs, but after she's had her play date, she'd like to be left in peace so she can follow her people around, just in case they need help loading the dishes or making the beds.  She will not do well left home alone for hours every day; she wants to be with her people most of the time.  \n\nMaya is  house trained, has excellent house manners, and is happy to sleep in a crate or on a dog bed.   \n\nGreat Pyrenees are livestock guardian dogs (LGDs), bred to work on their own in a field with their charges, be they newborn lambs or large livestock.  They are gentle, loving, loyal, and protective without being aggressive.   They guard primarily by showing their presence, sounding their deep bark,  and, if necessary, chasing predators away from their family.  Although they may masquerade as fluffy rugs, they are agile and fast and powerful when they need to be. Because LGDs are bred to patrol a very large (10-square-mile) area, strong, dig-proof, tall fencing is critical, as is a yard large enough for giant dogs to romp.  Likewise, LGDs  can never be off leash, as they WILL take off unexpectedly if they believe they need to check out a possible threat.  Even the most experienced trainers keep their LGDs securely fenced or leashed at all times!   \n\nSome Pyrs are working dogs who live with their flocks.  Other are moresuited to being family pets.  Maya definnitely falls into the latter category.  \n\nMaya is spirited, active, and graceful, but she does need assistance to jump (into an SUV, for example) because she has a congenital malformation of one knee.  She will likely develop arthritis early because of this issue.   \n \nMaya has been spayed, vaccinated, and treated for parasites.  She has an implanted microchip.  A series of radiographs of her knee will be made available to her adopter. \n\nTo view video clips of Maya, copy and paste these links into your browser, one at a time:\n \nhttps://youtu.be/H7LvMe9oduU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Td_-YUCsInU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Sz-rJSC0Zrs\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yx05wXLn_qQ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jC8TY-gOpic\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XeOcTTROdM&feature=youtu.be\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING MAYA, please send email to\n\nLynxcat@comcast.net\n\nto request an LGD application.  (Do not use the  \"ASK ABOUT\" button.) AFTER your application has been approved, we will set up an appointment for you to meet Maya and her foster parents in Hollister, CA under strict COVID guidelines. \n\nWe always answer email if we receive it. We never ship dogs. If you can see this listing, MAYA IS available; please do not write to ask whether she is. \n",

            "description": "Yogi is a very special dog! He has such expressive eyes and you can just feel his love coming through. He ADORES his people\u2014quality time is definitely his love language\u2014and he enjoys hanging out with his foster \"brother\" (our other dog) as well. He is very friendly and comfortable around other dogs but he isn't a big player\u2014he is much more interested in the people! Yogi is not a fan of cats, however. He pulls on the leash but does pretty well on walks overall; however, he'd much rather play ball instead. Yogi is estimated to be about 10 years old, but he hardly realizes it. He'll chase a ball for as long as his long legs can last! We play about twice a day for 10-15 minutes at a time and that seems to be plenty of exercise for him. He is very well behaved overall and seems like a very well adjusted family dog. He loves to follow us around the house and \"supervise\" all the household chores. It seems clear that Yogi was raised in a home and knows the basic in's and out's of the pet dog life\u2014he's housetrained, doesn't chew or destroy anything, can settle down and relax with us during family time, doesn't steal food even though he's tall enough, and is content to hang out on his bed in the laundry room when we leave the house. Yogi is also a fabulous home office coworker! He never barks and is happy and content to lie calmly and quietly next to me on his bed (we call it his desk) while I work. Yogi is such a fabulous companion that it's hard to imagine how he ended up in need of a forever home! If you're looking for a laid back companion to spend quality time with, Yogi is definitely your guy. He would love a home with a person who will adore him as much as he adores them.\u00a0\n",

This will delay her availability.\n\nIF NOT CLAIMED BY OWNER BY THURSDAY, JAN. 28; AVAILABILITY UNKNOWN\n\nValentine was found in the parking lot in front of the Petsmart on East State Street in Athens.  She is thought to be around 7 to 8 years old and weighs 6 pounds.  We found that she goes crazy for squeaky toys.  Due to the pandemic the shelter is currently adopting dogs to Athens Co. residents only.\n\nIf you have other dogs and/or children at home you must bring them in for a meet and greet to see if they are compatible. \n\nSupport the Athens County Dog Shelter by walking your dog or yourself!  It won't cost you a cent!  Download the app \"Walk For a Dog\" from http://wooftrax.com to your phone and select Athens County Dog Shelter and then take a walk!  It's great for you and your pooches plus it benefits the homeless dogs at the shelter.  Use the app each time you grab the leash.  You, your dog and the shelter will all benefit.\n\nPlease visit  http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/U0RLUOCMT7KI \nto see the wishlist of items that the Shelter is in need of.  Thank You!",

Learn more about me by reading my profile below; I just might be your new best friend! Apply on our website\n(\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n)\n\nto\n\nset up a private meeting or check below for my adoption event schedule.\n\nAge: 9 months old\n\nWeight: 47 lbs\n\nDog friendly: Unknown at the moment, but likely will figure it out with the right training.\n\nCat friendly: Unknown\n\nKid friendly: Yes\n\nPotty trained: Yes\n\nCrate trained: Yes\n\nHello! My name is Clyde. There's so much to learn about me, please read to the end :) I am from Missouri and have decided Minnesota is a great place to call home. I am a sweet boy and I can't wait to find my forever home.\n\nI currently have two human brothers (11 and 6 years old) and one human sister (4 years old). I like to follow them around the house to see what they are doing. I have not messed with any of their toys that lay all over the floor. I love to take naps on my bed.\n\nI strive to please, therefor an experienced dog owner would help me thrive! My ideal forever family will help me learn manners around other dogs.\nWe have been working on obedience training. I know 'sit' and am working on 'stay'. I am potty trained and crate trained. I sleep in my crate in the living room every night and go in it when my people leave the house.\n\nI am learning how to play tug-of-war and fetch. I am starting to figure out that I can chew on bones. I love treats and will try to do anything you want me to to get one! I love my food and get really excited when I see it being poured into my dish. I enjoy people and like to greet them when they come into the house. I am not alarmed by the doorbell or knocking as I do not bark at either one. I aim to please my people and often look to them for reassurance.\n\nWill you give me a chance?!\n\nAdoption Fee: $295\n\nINTERESTED IN MEETING ME?\n\nIf you'd like to arrange a private meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n**Note on breed and age determination:\n\nBreed and age are often determined on appearance, our own knowledge, veterinarian advice, and/or information from the sending shelters or previous owners. Most of our adoptable dogs were previously stray dogs with little history, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n.

If you live nearby or within driving distance, can you come to pick me up to go home with you?\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet history from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog.\n\nI am a Shih Tzu.  I am 3-years old and I weigh 20 pounds.  I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Sammy or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and dogs.  I am sweet and playful.  I haven't been around children and I might very well be OK with them but let's hope for a home with just adults.  OK?\n\nI need my own home.  I'm still young enough to have a good, long life with you taking care of me and I'll take care of YOU!\n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  My adoption fee is $350 and includes my vetting, neutering, and a microchip.\n",

He is the perfect bestie to take on runs or hikes. He would also love it if you had a dog to help him when meeting new people, as he's super shy and can be anxious on first dates. A dog experienced family a must. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. Apply to adopt Monty at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/SSRD/Dog",

            "description": "George is the kindest, gentlest soul who has simply won our hearts! When George came into our care as a stray, he was understandably nervous and shy. As we have gotten to know George, he has shown what a true gem he is! Although he is a senior, there is a puppy-like curiosity about George that is so endearing. George has been thriving with positive reinforcement training. Thanks to lots of tasty treats, patience, and encouragement, he has already learned ''sit'' and ''high five'' - he gets so happy when you let him show off his skills! George is comfortable and easy-going with other dogs of all sizes and would do best in a home with other friendly, social dogs. In his foster home, he loves to play with all of the other dogs and he is wonderful with everyone from 4 pounds to 70 pounds! We don't believe that George has known a lot of kindness in his life, and he will need patience and understanding as he learns ''how to dog.'' George walks nicely on a leash and appears to be house trained. He loves to be in the house playing with toys or in a soft bed but also loves to walk and run outside! George needs a nurturing, patient family that will show him all about the good life and help him be his best self. We are sure that George will continue to bloom in a loving forever home!\n\nGeorge's ideal home would include:\n- Other social, friendly dogs\n- No cats please!\n- A secure fenced in yard\n- Allowing George to be an indoor dog\n- No children under the age of 10 years old",

She is gentle and kind and will make a great companion.  She would love another dog playmate, needs a secure attached fenced yard and someone with \"at home\" time during the day to further her training and socializing.

They are a true bonded pair as they are always near one another & do one anothers face grooming. Gizmo is definitely the annoying little brother & Toto just goes with the flow. Gizmo will follow you everywhere & Toto just stares at you, awaiting the moment you sit down & he is invited up to be in his most favorite spot: your lap.\n\nToto is potty trained & Gizmo is as well but like any old man, he has accidents. A belly band will help keep clean up's easy peezy.\n\nNeed a security system? These two will let you know all about Stranger Danger & give you warnings. Even if they see a critter on tv, Gizmo will let you know. It's just the cutest. Due to their barking, they probably wouldn't be the best apartment/condo living buddies as your neighbors may not appreciate it.\n\nThey were raised with two small children & do just fine with them although they would love for you to be home more than away & get the love & attention that they have been missing these last couple of years due to a busy life with two young children.\n\nWant a Bathroom Buddy as well as perfect little Adventure Buddies? They are perfect for you.\n\nIf you have pets, they must be fixed, up-to-date on shots & your dog/s must be on heartworm prevention to be considered. We DO check your vet references.\n\nAdoption radius is 250'ish miles from Jacksonville, Fl. Applications via desktop/laptop (not mobile/tablet friendly) https://papillonpalsrescue.com/adoption\n\nWe are a small rescue & are limited on our resources. We take great pride in personal doing reference checks as well as home checks along w/ meet & greets to ensure that it is a perfect match all the way around. We are based out of Jacksonville, Fl & our typical adoption radius is 150 miles BUT we have been known to expand that a little for the most perfect home. A home w/ a secured, fenced-in yard is required (note: metal/wrought iron fences are not a secured fence as s/he could easily slip thru the spacing. Bird block or another fencing wrapped on the perimeter of the fence & partially buried at the bottom would help secure.) If you meet these requirements & want to apply to be reviewed when he is finally ready to be adopted, you can go to our website, go to adoption, fill out the application & email it back to us or if you wish to know more about this pet, please contact PapillonPals@comcast.net . Meet & greets happen once we check your references & afterwards, we will contact you to schedule a time to bring the dog to your home to meet your family.\n\nWe don't take calls about our adoptable dogs. We are an all-volunteer organization and do not have a shelter nor a receptionist to take calls and answer questions. All our dogs are fostered in loving homes by volunteers, most of whom work then come home to take care of their families and the little rescued dogs who live as members of the family.\n\nWe desperately need volunteers who are willing to foster little dogs in their homes while we search for approved adopters. We pay all the vet bills and provide supplies to our foster homes. For more information, please email Tami @ PapillonPals@comcast.net .\n\nWe are an all volunteer organization and do not have a brick and mortar facility so there is no place for you to \"come see the littles\". Please do not call us about our adoptable dogs. If you email us, we will respond, answering your questions within 48 hours of your inquiry.

            "description": "FROSTY is a gorgeous, playful, friendly retriever mix young dog who is estimated around 2 years old. He\u2019s a little under 50 lbs. He has some hearing loss, and is a little shy and nervous in new situations but is friendly to known people. He would do best with a structured home, fenced-in yard and planned quiet outings as he can get very stimulated. Older kids over 12 who are respectful of him should be fine, but probably not younger. He can be reactive behind a barrier, and we can educate any potential adopters on what that means for his perfect forever home. He's doing well with his foster's dogs but is not yet cat-tested. Frosty gets very anxious when left alone for long periods of time and doesn't do well with a crate, so a retired or work-from-home person would be ideal. Contact us for more details as we continue to get more information from our foster.\n\nAdoption fee covers: all vetting to age (including deworming, deflea etc ), spay/neuter (to be done at 6-8 months of age if not already done and included in adoption fee,  free 30 days of pet insurance, 6 week obedience course (or reimbursement for positive-based classes), and lifetime support of rescue.\n\nPlease fill out an application here for consideration: Tinyurl.Com/appshdr\n\n* During this COVID-19 crisis, we are essentially doing only virtual application processing and meetings are using social distancing practices. We will not have any open hours until further notice and doing meet and greets by appointment with the utmost caution for personal safety. We are not a shelter so there are NO DOGS AT THE SHOP unless we have open hours. All our dogs are in foster care and are available to be seen by appointment.\n\nNOTE: If a dog is listed as Adoptable, he or she is still available at that time. Also, our adoption area is within a several hour radius of us in Rochester, NY (NOT including Canada - sorry!)\n",

My favorite pastimes are playing with my squeaky toy and spending time with other friendly dogs. I am house trained and eager to be the newest member of a kind, patient family. Shelter life is new for me so I am startled by sudden noises and strong winds. I am also a little timid when on my leash although I am working on this with the patient humans here at HSNB. More leash training and socialization would be much appreciated! If you are interested in taking me home with you, please complete the form found on hsnb.org/adoptions. My adoption fee is $300.

Bones, antlers, Kongs- he loves them all!\n- A sure way to win Niko over is with food! Treats? Yes, please!\n- Niko lived outside his whole life so he often thinks random objects are toys...it can be kind of cute though when he decides to entertain himself with the most random things\n- Like most huskies, he can be pretty stubborn & would benefit from training to work on basic commands & manners\n\n- Niko is looking for a home with a 6 ft fence. Must have a 6 ft fence to adopt.\n- Must be an indoor dog\n\nBefore emailing- please read:\n- Yes, this dog is available for adoption\n- The adoption fee for Niko is $358\n- Apply at c2cnd.org\n- The adoption fee covers their age appropriate shots, microchip, deworming, spay/neuter, and any other medical expenses while in our care.\n- Local adopters only.

            "description": "Tucker Lee is a 15 yr old, 77 lb, neutered male Lab who was turned into the shelter \"due to age\". His fur is a rich dark black, a little longer, thick and lush and as he might have spent a lot of time outside. Hs eyes sparkle, and he seems to have a deep love for fur and human alike. \n\nWalking out to the yard and consistently in the yard, Tucker was a \"man on a mission\" almost \"power walking\" wherever he went, LOL.  And he frequently trotted around the yard and ran to visit  a dog in the adjoining yard. The daycare dogs barking and running in the distance were of great interest to him, even to the point of barking \"to them\" to start a conversation. \n\nSomeone forgot to tell him he is 15 yrs old. He is happy, a big smiler, most of all a \"schmoozerr\" and a polite talker albeit it slightly hoarse.  And despite his bad hips, when he runs, he has nicely adjusted and seems to \"glide\" above the ground. \n\nLike a younger pup, Tucker really enjoys fetching and catching a ball. We stopped after a bit after noticing he was huffing and puffing and realizing he would play  as long as you were willing to throw the ball. \n\nTuckler has such a magnetic personality and he hasn't finished living or giving yet. He is far too happy and engaged in life. An instant love, boy. And what a wonderful boy he is!\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from Lab Rescue OK!\n\nThe FIRST STEP in the adoption process is to fill out a Adoption Application at www.labrescue.net.\n\nProcessing of a application usually takes 5-7 days. \n\n*** Labs are not placed on a first come, first approved basis. Placement is at the discretion of Lab Rescue OK, Inc ***",

            "description": "Diva is a 5 month  old American Staffordshire mix looking for her forever hone.  She is good with kids and other dogs. May do well with a dog savvy cat. She is a very happy puppy and is crate trained. She would love a fenced in yard and a dog friend to rim with.  If you would like to learn more about Diva, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Cadey had some surgery on her hip, but gets along well with just a little skip in her step.  Breed exoerience and fence required.  If you would like to learn more about Cadey, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

CoCo will do best as either an only dog or with a submissive older/calm male. If CoCo is placed into a home with another dog her ideal match would allow Coco to be the top dog, would match her play-style, and will take her cues. CoCo does not like cats and also prefers a quiet home as loud noises are not her cup of tea, for this reason we will not place her into a home with children. CoCo requires a fenced in yard. CoCo will need to continue training once adopted and her new family will be required to have a minimum of 2 training sessions with her trainer.\n\nCoCo is great with her foster family and is a very loving dog! She is working on being the best girl she can be and to overcome her past! She is truly a special and unique gem of a dog!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Coco, please fill out an application today!",

He would be great in a fenced in yard and kids over 12.  If you would like to learn more about Henry, please complete ab application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

When it's nap time, he loves snuggling up on the couch. \n\nRoan loves life to the fullest and would do best with an active family. He needs a fenced in yard to get out some of his energy and will chase the ball as many times as you'll throw it.\n\nRoan currently lives with a kitty and does want to chase her but can be re-directed. He would do better with a cat that can teach Roan that there are boundaries. \n\n He's working on crate training and does like to go in his crate to nap and is potty trained. He would do best with older kids as he's a strong boy that can easily knock down a tiny one. Roan has loved everyone he's met. \n\nIf this boy looks like the pup for you, fill out an application: \nhttp://providingforpaws.org/adoption-and-foster-forms.html",

( HOW YOU DOIN?) I get along well with other dogs but I'm a bit intimidated by cats. I'm excellent on a leash and really enjoy walks. I'm doing really well with my house training, but occasionally I'll have an accident if you don't pay attention to my dancing cues. I like to be close to my people. Crates are not my thing \u2014 try to put me in a crate and see how fast I\u2019ll run away. I love running around my backyard and do well at coming in when you tell me. I would do best in a home with older kids (8 and up). I used to be left outside 24/7 so it\u2019s a relief to be an inside dog now. If you're looking for an all-around good boy, look no further than this scruffy face. I\u2019m up to date on all my shots, heartworm negative, on heartworm preventative and flea preventative, neutered, microchipped, and de-wormed. Tex\u2019s adoption fee is $325.",

My foster parents figured out really quick that I love to be petted and told how handsome I am. My home before this wasn't the best, so when my foster parents and siblings try to play with me I get a little confused - I just don't know what to do yet, but I am learning. They keep saying I'm a genius because I learned how to sit the first day I was here, and I'm getting really good at laying down too. I take treats softly, am crate trained (but I'd rather be out with humans), and my foster parents think I am pretty much house trained. I would fit in well with almost any family, but if you have another dog to help me learn that would be great!\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from Lab Rescue OK!\n\nThe FIRST STEP in the adoption process is to fill out a Adoption Application at www.labrescue.net.\n\nProcessing of a application usually takes 5-7 days. \n\n*** Labs are not placed on a first come, first approved basis. Placement is at the discretion of Lab Rescue OK, Inc ***",

She is a happy girl she's always wagging her tail always smiling and of course you can see by her pork chop self that she loves to eat. She is currently on a diet, she\nwill eat cooked carrots mashed up in her food also green beans the vet also told me to add cucumbers and zucchini to fill her stomach up and make her think she's getting more to eat than she really is. I have not been able to leave any dry dog food down because she will gobble the entire Bowl down even though she has wet food twice a day. She of course is housebroken she has never had an accident she uses the dog door without an issue she Barks A little bit when she see strangers down beneath my patio but that's to be expected. She loves to be petted and she does try to play a little bit with my other dog, but I think her size keeps her from that. \nFor more information email Nancy at flores.nancy.j@gmail.com\n",

I love to play,go for walks and sleep on your lap and in your bed. I'm very handsome, full of energy and looking for you to love me. I would really love to have a another dog buddy to play with,and maybe a toy box full of toys and chewy things to chew on. Lol  I'm staying in Wilton WI till I find my forever home. My adoption fee is only $300 pretty awesome I think. Because I'm worth it. Please go to Lastpawrescue.org and fill out a adopt application and ask for Charles. I will be waiting. \n\"501(c) 3 approved WI Agriculture license number 285589-DS.\"",

We believe her to be a German short hair/hound mix. She's a country girl at heart and is on the hunt for an active family, she would do best in a home with out small children and other pets. Mazy does very well on leash but can be nervous with loud traffic noises. Mazy is a good girl in her crate overnight but would prefer the company of someone that works from home. She is not however fond of sharing her toys or food, for that reason she would do best as the only dog. If you are interested in adopting Mazy please fill out an application at oneloveanimalrescue.orgTo be considered as this pet's adopter, please go to www.oneloveanimalrescue.org/adopt.html to complete your application.",

A small community shelter in the southern part of the state became Tanner's temporary home .. definitely not a good place for a large black dog to be with little chance to ever get out.\nTanner is 4-5 years old, very friendly, gets along with female dogs and little dogs, and loves playing fetch. He's a very confident dog and extremely intelligent. We've found that he responds to commands in both English and Spanish. Tanner can be very focused on a task (like playing fetch) and will need an owner with canine experience.\nIf interested in meeting Tanner please submit the online application found on our website www.argosdogrescue.org under Adopt.",

Doby loves vigorous pets, morning stretches (she's a pro), and the occasional belch. Doby walks very well on a leash, is well behaved in a crate, and appears housebroken. She's an exceptionally easy dog to love and would do well in most single pet households.\n\nMedical Observation: \n1/22 (Vet Check) -- Patient presents with possible otitis externa - mild inflammation of pinna. Ear cytology reveals occasional yeast and cocci predominantly in the left ear.\n\nBehavior Observation: \n1/22 (Per Vet) -- friendly and easily approachable \n1/18 (Per Finder) -- Friendly to everyone, does not like other dogs, dog walks great on a leash no pulling",

            "description": "Introducing Tiggert!  This gorgeous male terrier is so very sweet and ready to find a loving home.  He is very gentle and a little shy in his new surroundings at our rescue.  As each day goes by, we see a little more of his outgoing personality and his tail is always wagging.  Tiggert loves attention and is excited to be near people.  He is good with other dogs and is potty trained.\n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

(cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them.

Please visit our website -\n\nwww.cockeradoptions.org\n\nThere, you will find the current status of the dog, the links to our adoption and foster applications, and detailed information about our adopting and fostering procedures.\n\nADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ALL OF MY PICTURES ARE AVAILABLE BELOW! MY ORIGINAL INTAKE INFORMATION: Hi Everyone! My name is Cole, and I just arrived at CSAC from a shelter. I was found as a stray. Right now, I am in the caring hands of one of the great Vets that work with the CSAC. They are checking me out and making sure I am healthy. Hopefully, I will find my new family that will turn me into a happy, cherished pet. For more information about this dog, email our Adoption Coordinator. Our adoption process starts with an application. If you are interested in adopting this pup, please click the Adopt menu at the top of the screen, read about our process, and click the application link. The medical and custodial care of the many Cockers in our care is tremendous. More and more dogs are abandoned with urgent and serious medical issues. We are committed to providing the best possible care for these forgotten friends. Unfortunately, the mounting high costs are beginning to limit the number of dogs we are able to take into our program. Even if you cannot adopt or foster one of our current adoptable dogs, please consider making a donation. The Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization, and your donations are entirely tax deductible. Click the Donate menu at the top of the screen. For more information, visit www.cockeradoptions.org.",

He is neutered, up to date on shots, and appears to be house broken.  He is heartworm positive, but is on the slow kill method and comes with 18 months of Heartguard. \n\nHe is a lover, not a fighter.  He is a quick LEANER, yes leaner. You pet him, he leans on you. You stand by him, he leans on you. All four legs work properly, but he just wants reassurance that you are there. He gets along with other dogs, kids, and other people of all ages who are able to support a leaner. He wants to play, sleep on the couch, and eat snacks, so he's pretty much a teenager without the attitude. \n\nThe adoption fee for Prince Charles is $125.00.  If you are ready to roll out the red carpet for him to join your household, please fill out an application and send it to myhappytail@yahoo.com.

Payton is a typical beagle - he loves to be outdoors and using his nose to check things out.  He likes people and is very friendly, always eagerly greeting anyone that stops to meet him.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

Ruger likes other dogs, but is apprehensive around children and needs a home with no cats.\n<br>Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

Bella is nervous when she first meets people, but once she warms up, she rolls over for belly rubs and hops around to play. She will let you hold her like a baby and she wants a family that will give her a lot of attention. She is potty trained and enjoys going for walks. She is good with other dogs and cats. She was born in July 2015 and is around 12 pounds (she looks bigger in photos than she really is).

Our \u201crez dogs\u201d  are mixed breeds and we can never guarantee their heritage, so we say they \u201clook like\u201d or \u201chave traits like\u201d, to give our best estimates. But honestly, your guess is as good as ours! We can also only guess at what their weight will be when they are full grown. For this reason, we expect adopters to be flexible in their expectations of size and appearance when adopting a puppy. What we do know is that these animals are very smart, make wonderful companions, and are truly grateful and loyal to their rescuers!\n",

            "description": "Jemison #7704 is a handsome 1.5 year-old male Black Mouth Cur mix. Jemison is sweet, friendly, smart, and calm. . He is house and crate trained. He knows the commands: sit, stay, lay down, crawl, search and shake.  He walks very well on leash and enjoys long walks and dog parks. . He has been in a home with a 12 year old and spent lots of time with his neighbor's 5 year old.  He  is calm around children. That said he is also energetic and playful and will need daily dedicated exercise, playtime and mental stimulation. A big fenced-in backyard would be great. He does like being with his people and can get anxious when they aren\u2019t around; he did live with a cat and they got along great, so a cat or another pup friend may be good for him. He is being treated for Erlichia and is seeking an adopter who will continue LCAR\u2019s provided treatment at no cost. He weighs 75 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi everybody, my name is Lily, but my silly foster momma calls me Itchy McRickets.  I am around 13 weeks old, a female Lab/Terrier mix.  I  had really bad skin and I also had rickets, but I am doing so much better now and have come a long way. I am very upbeat and happy all the time.  I was the only single pup in my foster home in TN so I was alone a lot and can handle that pretty well.  I play well with the adult dogs too, I am not too pesty!\n \nYou can call her Lily which is what the vet named her. She loves the cat too.  \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

Must be an active family, walking/hiking.\n\nMeet Curly Joe.  He's twice the corgi you'll ever want. Why? He is a Cardigan-Pembroke mix (2 times the corgi with merle coloration.) Three year old Curly Joe is a BIG guy (the Cardigan genes) with a BIG personality.  He loves to snuggle and kiss, but on his terms. He is awesome at communication, but needs a very dog savvy family that is compassionate enough to listen and observe his behavior in order to understand AND respect what he's feeling. Curly Joe LOVES to go for power walks, and would be a great hiking companion.  Daily exercise will surely help him to slim down, but he is also happy to play couch potato in between soccer games and his daily sniffy walk, allowing his people to get their work done.  He REQUIRES a fenced yard for those soccer games (Treibball anyone?).\n\nDuring his foster stay, he played with many other dogs including Aussies and Corgis from young to old, girls and boys. Curly Joe met a parrot, and he visited a resident cat without problems.  He would love to have another dog brother or sister, but as long as his family is active, he could be happy as an only dog as well.  He does become lonely if he can't be near his people though (slight separation anxiety accompanied by the cutest, most soulful howl), so he would truly be happiest with a family where someone is home most of the time (work from home, active retired, multiple persons with alternating schedules).  Curly Joe would not be an appropriate companion for children and requires an adult only family.  Curly Joe is neutered and up to date on all vaccines. microchipped, and house/crate trained. He will need to continue on his diet. \n\nThis bears repeating - Curly Joe REQUIRES a fenced yard and adult only family. Do not inquire if you do not meet these requirements. You will not receive a response. To make an inquiry about Curly Joe, please email claireelizabeth@petssecondchance.org .  Visit our website at www.petssecondchance.org for more information.",

He thinks he is a lap dog and will crawl right in your lap to cuddle and get some love. He enjoys napping on the couch and sleeps in some very funny looking positions. Dukke is crate trained but needs a little encouragement to go in at times. He sleeps in his crate at night and does just fine there.\n\nDukke rides very well in the car. He lays on the seat quietly. He will also jump in and out on his own. He walks decently on a leash but does pull a bit when distracted. He's easy to redirect though. He also sits nicely for treats! Dukke is potty trained and will whine a little or go to the door when he wants to go outside.\n\nDukke gets along great with other dogs! He enjoys playing with them and running with them in the yard. He plays well on his own also and likes to flip toys around the house and chew on a good bone. No cats for Dukke, please! He is a! bit too interested in them and he is so wonderful.....we want to keep him at his best.\n\nDukke is an all-around good boy! And he looks absolutely stunning. He would be a great addition to any family. Could he be your fur-ever buddy?",

(Biscuit)\n\nHe is only 6 weeks right now, so he likes to play, potty and sleep. Doesn't get any better for a little guy!!!\n\nTriscuit loves attention. He will play with humans and dogs. He cuddles nice and will fall asleep in your lap. He already plays tug of war and really likes toys and bones. Triscuit is eating hard food and drinking water very well. He's a cute little chubby boy, who really enjoys his food. He does use potty pads in his play area, but he is not potty trained since he is still so little. It's been a bit too cold to take him outside for a walk, so he will need leash training at some point. Being such a little guy, he doesn't require a lot of space right now but eventually, he would love to roam around his house and yard to play. Triscuit is a fun, sweet little boy who will bring many years of happiness to any family. Ready for some puppy cuddles?",

            "description": "Maverick 7703 is a handsome 9-month-old Lab/Boxer mix. Maverick is a sweet and active boy. He is house trained. He knows the commands: sit and crate. He will need an active adopter who understands he needs daily exercise, playtime and mental stimulation. A big fenced-in backyard would be great to help him get his energy out. Once he gets his energy out, he is sweet and cuddly in a quiet environment. He weighs 50 pounds and is full grown.                                                     This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Juda is a female estimated to be 2-3 years old. She is spay, UTD on all vaccinations and preventatives. \n\n?Fence Required\n?8+ years old min.\n?Requirements must be met or app will NOT be processed.\n\nHer foster mom writes the below about her: \n\nJuda is a petite in build dog who is energetic and likes to go where you do. She will shadow you where ever you go, if you allow her. She is getting accustomed to sleeping in the kennel at night but the first 20 minutes is her getting \"comfortable\" for the night as she may whine wanting to be next to her human as  she sleeps fine in the bed if you let her. She has not had any accidents in the house or kennel but she is not left to free roam the house when alone. Her routine is very simple which she seems to have down. In the morning she goes immediately outside from her kennel. She is very excited when she first comes out of the kennel and likes to express this by jumping, which we are working on her not doing. She is very good about going out and taking care of business and returning to the backdoor when she is ready to come in. She eats twice a day - morning and evening and enjoys her treats of eggs, pure coconut, and peanut butter bones. She enjoys playing with toys and tugawar. She has a buddy that is approx 1.5 - 2 yr old altered male who is taller than she but that do play very well together. She has shown no aggression towards the other dog and will take treats sitting next to him. They do eat at the same time but on opposite sides of the kitchen. \n\nJuda knows how to sit, speak, potty, come and we are working on kennel, sit and down (previously mentioned her jumping). \nShe is a very loving dog and smart and would make a great companion. \n\nUntil her jumping is under control, I would not suggest having her around small children for fear of knocking them over.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Juda, please review our process, FAQs and the application.

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi there, I am Zelda, a female Hound/Shepherd mix, 6 months old with a sweet disposition.  I love giving kisses and hanging out with my dog friends. For a young pup I am pretty calm. I am great with cats and adore the child in my foster home. I crate well, and will go in my crate for a treat. I am working on my potty training. \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

Clearly the predominant breed is Rottweiler, with that luxurious shiny black coat and pretty brown markings. Kora was rescued just in time from a kill shelter in TX. It is unclear why she was left there, and sadly, this happens very frequently. Too often a dog is dropped at a shelter because owners \u201cjust don\u2019t have time\u201d or \u201cshe doesn\u2019t behave\u201d, or simply because a puppy is a novelty and when the dog grows up it becomes a nuisance. The casualty is a pup that is ripped from the only home he or she ever knew. Whatever the case may be, Kora was extremely lucky and is currently with a loving foster family while she awaits her forever home. \n\nKora\u2019s foster family says she is super sweet but not needy. She loves her people, but is also perfectly happy laying in her bed chewing a bone. She is spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative, dewormed, flea/tick treated, and up to date on all her vaccines. Now all she needs is her own people to complete the package! Kora is very loyal, and would be a great family dog; likely with older children due to her size and breed. It is always recommended that young children are never left unsupervised with ANY dog. Children often love to be physical (ie: big bear hugs) with their new family members and rescue dogs can become nervous. We can never be very sure of what these pups have gone through. An adult-only home would be great for Kora as well. She is a true love bug with her humans and is very mellow, but likes to be \u201cin charge\u201d with other dogs, so being the only dog in the home would suit her well. Though \u201cneediness\u201d is a common trait in Rottweilers, Kora displays none of that so far. Kora seems to be fully house trained and her manners are very good. She will be very gentle with her fluffy bed in her kennel and is quite obliging when her humans dress her up. You can see by her pictures how patient (and pretty!) she looks!\n\nKora is calm natured and loves walks.  She walks great on the leash, and has shown no aggression at all towards other dogs from a distance while walking. While in her yard Kora only reacts to other dogs if they get too close to her fence. She absolutely LOVES car rides. Foster mom took her out for an afternoon and she jumped right in the car and laid down. She was great for the whole ride! The medical staff at the vet that cared for her said that she was a very easy and polite lady when they had to treat or examine her for anything. All the volunteers loved her!\n\nWhen choosing a new family member it is important to research the different breeds of dogs available to you. Personality traits, size, and temperament should all be key factors when deciding what pup will fit well in your family. The Rottweiler is one of the most popular dogs in the USA, UK, and Canada. For good reason, too, as this breed is a wonderful blend of the loving house-dog and the steadfast protector that will guard your home and your children. Not only that, but they\u2019re relatively easy to manage within the home, as they don\u2019t require vigorous exercise, and their intelligence makes them one of the easier dog breeds to train. Rottweilers are also relatively docile, and are willing to learn at the hand of someone they love (although it takes a bit to build that trust for this breed).\n \nThe Rottweiler breed often gets a bad reputation. You\u2019ve probably heard \u2014 in one way or another \u2014 that Rotties can be incredibly aggressive, downright mean, and off-putting to other people. While these traits can certainly be true, and are perhaps a bit worse when it comes with a dog powerful enough to do damage, these traits don\u2019t apply to most Rottweilers.\n\nThe true personality of a Rottweiler, and what they were bred to be, is a mixture of the loyal, steadfast watchdog, and the incredibly loving homebody. Also, despite popular belief, the Rottweiler is actually one of the most intelligent dog breeds in existence. Their ability to learn, adapt to their environments, and their keen eye for their surroundings are nearly unparalleled. Not only that, but they\u2019re also well-rounded within the home. They\u2019re patient and gentle with children, and the more they grow to know them, the stronger their protective nature becomes.\n \nRottweilers are very cautious dogs, and people often see this as standoffishness or mean. This personality trait is rooted in their history. They\u2019re extremely reserved when it comes to others infringing upon those they love, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not friendly. They\u2019re simply aware of the situation, and know how they must react if they\u2019re called to action.\n \nThe personality of a Rottweiler can also sometimes be considered needy. They love to be loved, and love to love, and often create a sense of dependency with their owners. Meaning these are not the dogs to own if you don\u2019t have the proper time to be at home with them (or train them, as Rottweilers come with serious responsibility). Rottweilers, while dignified, confident, and powerful, are also extremely sensitive.  All-in-all, these dogs are fantastic companions and will protect the household in earnest, will love abundantly, and are great additions to a home with youngsters. Another thing to note about their personality is that they\u2019re fearless. If they\u2019re called to action, or feel they need to protect those they love, they never hesitate.\n\nKora has many of the typical Rottweiler characteristics and is protective of her family and the people she loves. It is part of the breed. She will need someone that can help show her that she doesn\u2019t have to worry about protecting them. She needs to know when she should alert and when not to alert to situations. A family that is very familiar with this breed, or a similar one, would be ideal for Kora. She is on the right path and, so far, has been a model citizen, but training will need to continue.  She is a delightful girl and will be a wonderful addition to the right family. Those who know Rotties will quickly realize Kora is a gem!\n\nElan is a wonderful boy, and would make a fantastic addition to a family willing to continue his training and to love him unconditionally. He would thrive in a home with someone who is knowledgeable in these particular breeds or has experience with larger, active breeds. With structure and consistency, Elan would be an exceptional addition to an active family.\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE\n<b>\n<b><b> RESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5513C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n<b>ABOUT OUR RESCUE</b></b>\n\nWe go the extra mile for every dog and do whatever it takes to make sure that that dog finds happiness, we give 100% and more.

I am a heartworm survivor (I am now HW negative!) and unfortunately I have been bounced around to a few different homes, but I am SO ready to find a home where I can stay furrrrr-ever! I am a sweet, playful, lovable little guy. I can be dog selective and would do best in a home without small animals. When I most recently arrived at SPCA Florida I had some broken teeth, but I have had them extracted and am still able to eat and live normally! They say good things come in small packages, and that's me! If you'd like to make me the newest member of your family, click the link below, select \"large dogs\" and ask for Stitch!\nhttps://www.picktime.com/61eb69c2-2e72-47ff-bcf0-01e8ce01f1c5",

            "description": "Spike #7705 is a handsome 1.5 year-old male, Boxer/Hound mix.  Spike is a big teddy bear who is outgoing and friendly. He loves attention from people.  He is house trained. He knows the commands: sit, stay, no and eat (waits to eat). He is very smart. He has been in a home children ages 3, 5, and 7 and did great. Spike came in with his brother Simba #7706, if you are looking for a pair they do get along. He is being treated for Lyme\u2019s disease and is seeking an adopter who will continue his treatment at no cost. He weighs 52 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Wow! Just wow! Don't you love those eyes on beautiful Elsa?\n\nThis approximately 3-year-old German Shepherd mix (we think with Husky) is a large, strong girl. She came to us after she started getting picked on and attacked by the former owner's other female dog.\n\nElsa is very sweet, loving, and generally well-mannered. She needs room to run and has been known to jump 5' fences, so she will need supervision outside until she settles in. She would do best with an experienced handler, as she can be strong and some times stubborn and needs someone who has time for her. We do know that she does not get along with cats, but would probably do well with another big, active male dog. Because she can be a bit of a \"bull in a china shop,\" smaller kids may not be a good idea.\n\nIf you can give Elsa an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.",

He knows his basic obedience training commands, and already knows \"Sit\" and \"Stay\". He walks well on a leash and is good in the car.\n\nCyrus is usually good with meeting new dogs, but he has recently become unpredictable with the other dog in his current home, so we are recommending a proper intro with female dogs only. He's very curious, and always up for play time in the yard. Unfortunately, he does not do well with cats, so he will need a feline free home. Cyrus was previously in a foster home with a 2 yr old Toddler and does just great with him.\n\nHe's a big lover, and would love a home with a \"cuddler\" adopter-- Cyrus loves to cuddle in your lap if you'll let him, and is great in a kennel~! typically does not require being kenneled during the day, though he is still a puppy so his adopter will need to be sure that any kids toys, etc .are picked up prior to leaving. He hasn't quite learned yet what to do with a ball, but he LOVES his nylabones and is learning how to play 'pounce' with the tennis, although is with puppy-style coordination.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

            "description": "Chase is 5 years old Rat Terrier Mix and he is currently in foster care so we have learned more about him.     He lost his home when his landlord said \"no pets\".  Chase is very polite, smart, obedient, and quiet. He walks very well on a leash.\nHe also grunts!  Chase gets along with other dogs in his foster home, but displays jealousy when they seek attention when he's on his foster mom's lap.\nThis behavior may pass as he becomes more confident.  He chases the resident cat, so a cat free home would be a better choice for him. He can be shy, yet a wonderful greeter at the door. \n\nNo cats, no kids for Chase. \n\nChase is  neutered, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped.  His adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nChase is kindly sponsored by Charlie Fisher, Chelsea Barber, Dan Courtine in honor of Holly and Xander, Suzanne and former NCCR residents, Tillie Mae and Bron Bron, and Rebecca Wood. Thank you!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHello everyone, I am Star, a female Chihuahua mix, 4 years old and 12 lb.  I came to the shelter because my owner went into a medical facility.  I have lost a little hair due to neglect but it\u2019s growing back with good diet and time.  I'm wearing fashion sweaters until my pretty black coat returns. I am a super cuddler, and love little walks on my leash.  I am very sweet and happy, outgoing and playful at times.  I do get along well with other dogs.\n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

            "description": "Abigail is a 2 year old, Plot hound mix, who came in to rescue as the proud mama of 7 babies. Now that her puppies have found their own homes, it's Abigail's turn! Abigail is only about 30 lbs, and she can be shy at first. However, don't let that stop you, because once she gets to know you, she will become your best friend. Abigail's favorite hobbies are rolling around in the leaves, and following her foster parents around the house. She is currently fostered with both cats and dogs, and does great with both, but mostly spends her time with the humans. Abigail is crate trained and house broken, and will make an excellent addition to anyone's home. Her adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi, I am Stella, a female Husky mix, 1.5 years old and 40 lb.  I was brought to the shelter as a stray but the man had found me two weeks earlier. He intended to keep me but it turns out I was not a good farm dog as I chased the calves.  I am really sweet. I can be a little shy at first, but once I bond with someone I want to be close to them and will often lean on their legs or sitting on their feet.  I am good with other dogs, not good with cats, and pretty clean in my kennel so foster mom thinks I may be housebroken. \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Shadow is 5 years old at the time of intake in December 2020. Shadow is good with people of all ages and other dogs, but no cats for this guy! Poor Shadow was living life as a stray on the dangerous streets of Texas, and he was barely surviving. When Shadow was rescued from the streets, he was suffering from severe hair loss, he was extremely emaciated, flea infested and anemic. We took him immediately to our veterinary partner where he received the medical care he required and now Shadow is ready to move on to his happy life. Shadow has a typical Retriever disposition--loving and mischievious--and he needs some work on basic commands! Shadow is looking for a home where he will be safe and loved for the rest of his life, and because forever means forever, he will never be homeless again. If you can give Shadow that life, please apply online to adopt Shadow (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Luckily, a nice guy started to allow me to come inside the shop at night to lay my head. He knew I needed better and contacted Chain of Hope. They gladly took me in. They named me Indi (like Indy race car)... ha! Do you get it? Anyways, I am the sweetest girl and love people and other dogs. Since I have been a stray my whole life, I do need some help on some obedience, but I'm a fast learner. I know how to sit already. I absolutely love being in the shelter, I couldn\u2019t imagine what a home and a real family is like. I bet it\u2019s magical! If you are willing to show me, I promise to be a good girl! \n\n*House and kennel trained\n*Good with other dogs\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please visit www.chainofhopekc.org and fill out an adoption application. Once received someone from our team will be right with you.\n\n**Local Adoption Only - Kansas City Area**\n\nAdoption fee includes deworming, all vaccinations, rabies tag, micro-chip, spay/neuter, heart worm test, flea & tick prevention, and heart worm prevention.",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nMy name is Belle.  I am a female Pit/Hound mix, 3 years old and 43 lb.  I was surrendered to the shelter after I showed up as a pregnant stray. The people let me have my puppies, then gave all them all away and dumped me at the shelter.  I have some scrapes and scars on my head and legs, likely from other dogs.  I am very sweet and mellow, friendly with other dogs and I love belly rubs. \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

A large fenced yard is a must for COOPER and a family who are willing and able to walk him at least 2 miles twice a day to get rid of excess energy\nHe has come from a \" one dog \" family so is used to being the only dog , which may be the best fit for him. Although he does get on with some dogs , he has a more dominant personality  which can easily be rectified with more basic obedience training.  Basically, he is a young dog that just needs to learn his boundaries. He is affectionate, playful and loves to ride in the car. \nPLEASE no apts or families with kids or younger teenagers.  An experienced standard poodle owner only.\n\nIf you would like to apply to adopt this sweet boy, please go to our website www.somersetcottagepoodlerescue.org and click on adopt to download an adoption application. \n\nCOOPER'S adoption donation is $1195",

            "description": "Hi, I\u2019m Jodi!\n\nMy mom was a Golden, and my dad was probably a greyhound \u2013 as you can see, I am all legs! I\u2019m just about 6 months old, so I still have some growing to do.\nI am a very sweet and gentle puppy. I walk great on the leash and take treats very gently. I like to go on walks and car rides. I like people and other dogs, and I\u2019d love to have a dog buddy in my forever home. I\u2019d be good with a calm cat as well. I am usually quiet but will let you know if I see or hear someone coming up to the house.\n\nI do have some puppy habits. I like to chew things that aren\u2019t mine, like shoes. I will drop them when asked, though, and can be redirected to my own toys. I also still worry about if I\u2019m going to get my next meal, so I can be possessive about my food and treats and I am nervous when I eat. My foster parents have been working on that by giving me really yummy treats when I\u2019m eating or chewing on a toy and I\u2019m learning really quickly that having people around my food and toys is a good thing. Since I\u2019m still a puppy, I need to make frequent trips outside to use the bathroom. I also like to be around my people all the time. I will need some training to be independent.\n\nI am super calm and laid-back in the house. I love to do zoomies outside, though, and I am really fast! So I\u2019d love a big yard or trips to the dog park. I\u2019d also probably make a great running partner, especially since I am so good on the leash! And then I will be so happy to cuddle up with you on the couch. I am such a cool dog!\n\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Jodi or in learning more about her, please contact Golden Bond Rescue at info@goldenbondrescue.com.\n\nAdoption Fee: $1200 + $35 microchip fee\n \n\n* * * * * * * * * *\nEvie is being fostered in Milwaukie, Oregon\n\nPACIFIC NORTHWEST APPLICANTS ONLY: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Northern California and Southern British Columbia. Please do not inquire if outside these areas.\n\nGolden Bond DOES NOT adopt to families with children under 10. Home ownership and secure 5-foot fencing is required.\n\nSee our website, www.goldenbondrescue.com for more information.\n",

You see, Chain of Hope has been a part of my story for a long time and finally, after a lot of time on a chain outside and a month at KCPP, I\u2019m here! Since my life has been a little rough, it took me time to warm up but now, I\u2019m beginning to trust people. I love to play and absolutely love sausage biscuits, peanut butter, and squirt cheese. Let me tell you, I\u2019m very food motivated and will learn quickly with some extra treats! \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a medium size dog that can bring lots of fun and energy to your mix, definitely look at me! \n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please visit www.chainofhopekc.org and fill out an adoption application. Once received someone from our team will be right with you.\n\n**Local Adoption Only - Kansas City Area**\n\nAdoption fee includes deworming, all vaccinations, rabies tag, micro-chip, spay/neuter, heart worm test, flea & tick prevention, and heart worm prevention.",

I am playful and I love my daily walks and going to the doggie park where I have to say hi to everybody (people and pups). I run free there and I will let you know when we can go back home. I\u2019m a quiet girl and I enjoy sitting by your side on the sofa. ??\n\nI was rescued from a hoarding situation so I was not taken well care of. I developed a pretty bad skin infection on my bum area and never got help for it so my skin there is permanently rougher and hairless.  But my special skin spray and shampoo helps me there so much and it looks and feels a ton better. I also use eye drops to help my dry eye feel nice and hydrated. These supplies I need to feel better are not very expensive so don\u2019t worry... you can still adopt me!!!  Other than that I\u2019m  great and my rescue tells me I am perfect just the way I am! ??\n\nPlease help me find my forever home so I can get my second chance at happiness and security!  Share my story. I am ready for my own family that truly cares for me and will love me. \nApply Now ??????????\n\nhttps://www.vegaspetrescueproject.com/dog-adoption-interest-form",

They will go to their forever homes with a collar and leash, food to acclimate, bowls, toys and their bed.\n\nSpay/neuters are included in the adoption fee when done at our vet at 5-6 mos, although required regardless.\n\nWe have a 100 mile radius for adoption\n \nIf you are interested in adding me to your family, please complete an application at:  https://causeforpaws.net/cause-for-paws-adoptable-pets/cause-for-paws-adoption-application/\n",

She has been a wonderful momma to her litter of 10 puppies, and now it's time for her to find her own forever family. She knows some commands, takes treats very gently, and LOVES to play fetch and go for a ride in the car. Lucy is good with kids. Lucy prefers to be an only dog, but would do well with another calm housemate. Please consider opening your heart and home to this sweet girl.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

He will need time to decompress, acclimate, and feel safe. It does not happen overnight. \n\nOlder dog savvy kids would be best, slow and proper introductions to dog(s) in the home, and a home without cats!\n\nIf interested, please submit an app at midlandcountypitstop.org. *Submitting an app doesn't guarantee adoption.\n\nHe is utd on vaccines, neutered, and chipped.\nHis adoption fee is $250",

I am suuuuuper excited to meet new people and new dogs, I love everyone and everything\u2026 well, except cats. That\u2019s why my mommy has to help me find a new home, too many cats in the house for me, and I have a high prey drive when it comes to cats. This is something my new family needs to have experience with. I\u2019m super smart and know a ton of commands and even some tricks! I\u2019ve started agility training and looooooooove it! I need to be in a dog-savvy home that is active and it must be a home that will continue to work with me on my skills and take me to classes since I\u2019m such a smart baby! I love my toys and playing with my mommy or other dogs and am great on the leash! My mommy walks me on a hands-free leash, that\u2019s how good I am! I\u2019m working on potty training; I\u2019m good at telling my mommy when I need to go outside to go pee and can hold my bladder in the house for a few hours without any problems. I sleep through the whole night in my crate without any accidents. And while I\u2019m an active puppy, I also love to cuddle and watch TV in the evenings; my favorite place is a lap, I love to curl up in a ball on my mommy\u2019s lap and snuggle for hours. I would love to live with other dogs and would also be completely happy as an only dog since I\u2019m so attached to people. I would also love to be your Baby! Want to meet me so I can give you kisses?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Baby is about 5 months old and weighs 35 lbs.]\n\n(2101)",

He arrived with his companion Cindy Lou.  Both dogs had been left outside in the freezing cold temperatures to starve.  When the animal control officer went to the residence to remove the pair, he found Nicholas curled up around Cindy Lou trying to keep her warm.  They are both very sweet, lovable young dogs who have suffered greatly at the hands of heartless, cruel individuals.\n\nBetter photos and more information on the way.\n\nLink to CINDY LOU's Bio: https://www.petfinder.com/dog/cindy-lou-50355434/nj/lambertville/animal-alliance-nj290/\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

But, with a little gentleness and a lot of tasty bribes, she'll be your best friend. She likes to chase cats and would prefer to be the only pet in her home. Autumn is currently undergoing treatments for heartworm disease. Until she has completed her treatments and is fully recovered, she is available for adoption only in the Atlanta area. She must be able to come to Furkids' shelter for treatments. Autumn's estimated birthdate is 3/31/2019, she weighs 45 lbs, and her adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Autumn, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

She arrived with her companion Nicholas.  Both dogs had been left outside in the freezing cold temperatures to starve.  When the animal control officer went to the residence to remove the pair, he found Nicholas curled up around Cindy Lou trying to keep her warm.  They are both very sweet, lovable young dogs who have suffered greatly at the hands of heartless, cruel individuals.\n\nBetter photos and more information on the way.\n\nLink to NICHOLAS' Bio: https://www.petfinder.com/dog/nicholas-50355498/nj/lambertville/animal-alliance-nj290/\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Yzma is a joy. And if you are looking for a darling senior to pour your heart into, you couldn't\u00a0find a more deserving girl. Found roaming in SC, Yzma was a pitiful sight. She had a poor body score\u00a0and coat and she had a noticeable weakness in her rear quarters, but despite her shaking fear, there was an infinite sweetness about her.\u00a0 And as soon as she left the shelter and was settled in a foster home, we were rewarded with a brilliant smile. Yzma is happy and loving and does best when she can follow the lead of a confident canine companion. She is house trained and does well without being crated.\u00a0 She likes to spend her time rotating between the dog beds and exploring the yard. And she is always up for a treat or a pet. She absolutely loves snow.\u00a0\n\nYzma has degenerative disc disease and our vet does not feel she is a candidate for surgery. This means she will need an owner who is committed to managing her condition with a combination of oral medication and other therapies, which may include things like laser, acupuncture, etc. Other considerations like managing her weight, and restriction of high impact activity ( avoiding stair use,\u00a0 not allowing her to jump on or off furniture) would be important for Yzma as well as quality food and supplements. Being that her condition is both chronic and there is the\u00a0possibility of acute flare-ups, it is important for an adopter to know that this will be an ongoing process.\u00a0\n\nWe realize that Yzma's needs won't be the right match for every applicant, but this is a truly special girl in more ways than one and we do believe that there could be a special someone out there who will see that the love and devotion they give\u00a0to Yzma will be returned tenfold. She's totally worth the effort. For more info or to apply, email opundo@operationunderdog.org\n",

She is very people focused and wants nothing more then a family of her own. This sensitive girl is looking for a patient adopter who will give her some time to settle into her new home and with meeting new people. Harper craves strong daily routine. Unknown things and environments make Harper anxious until acclimated. Harper is a quick learner and very treat motivated. She is house and crate trained, and does well on a leash when not distracted by new people or new dogs. Harper would do well with another calm older dog in the home and tends to follow their lead. In her foster home, Harper has done well with a dog savy cat but does like to chase the other cat in the home. Since Harper is fearful with new situations she is looking for a adult only home who is willing to be patient and continue working on earning Harper's trust. Once she trusts you, you have her loyalty completely and she will be your best friend. Does Harper sound like a good fit for your home. Please send in your adoption application today at www.underhoundrailroad.org\n\nHarper is currently being fostered in North Carolina and can be transported to her adoptive home North.",

            "description": "Hi there, my name is Jager! I am a sweet, gentle, and extremely affectionate boy. I will never pass up the chance to cuddle or spoon. I am highly intelligent and have an incredible memory. I am eager to learn and to please my human. I know some basic commands like sit, down, stay, wait and come. I am trained to sit patiently while my food is being prepared or while you are in the kitchen. My favorite toys are the squeaky ones. I show little interest in balls or ropes, but go 'nuts' for a squeaky toy. They come in handy when you want me to do something. I have mild anxiety when in the car so it's a good idea to always make sure I have one or two toys for the ride. If it is a longer drive, my foster mom gives me a bully stick and I do well. There are some manners that I am still working on such as not counter surfing for human food. I can be dog reactive on walks, but I am working on this and have progressed quite a bit. The staff and trainer here at the shelter will show my adopter how to work on this so I can continue making progress. I am selective about other dogs, some dogs I do very well with and some dogs just rub me the wrong way. I do not care for cats. I am looking for a home where I will be treated just like a member of the family! I am going to need daily exercise, training, continued socialization, and plenty of affection. My adoption fee includes my neuter, a microchip, vaccines, and a fourteen day limited health guarantee through Redstone Animal Hospital! Come visit me today!

Our educated guess is that she is a Pointer mix, approximately 35-40 pounds.\n\nEmily enjoys long walks on the beach, in open fields, and in the forest. She is most comfortable hiking on the trail with my family. Smells on the trail are her favorite! I\n\nlove kids of all ages and other dogs too. Emily would like to be in a house with another dog who is my bestie and could show me the ropes. She ignores cats. Emily enjoys the dog park a lot and like to play with dogs my size or larger. She's become a greeter at the dog park and is very sociable and\n\nalways ready for a milk bone or bully stick!\n\nThis girl is looking forward to being your best friend-she's all ears and ready to hear about your day. She may not have much advice to offer, but dog cuddles and kisses are a pretty good alternative.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email info@petrescuealliance.com, and go to petrescuealliance.com to fill out an application!\n2/2/21 2:49 PM",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

When I\u2019m not playing, I love to either chew my bones or snuggle up and nap. I am doing great with potty training and basic commands, too!\n\nRuby and her five sisters were surrendered to an overcrowded shelter in northern Louisiana. We believe they are golden retriever mixes who were born in September 2020. Ruby is currently around 20 lbs and is expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. Ruby is good with other dogs and kids (we\u2019re not sure about cats, but expect she would be just fine with them). \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

During that time he lived as an outside dog. His foster mom stated that he is smart because he mastered house training without a hitch! He is great with other dogs and loves to run around the yard. He is very charming, cute and the perfect size. Byll loves people and kids as well. He was very gentle with a 3 year old and a 1 month old that was in the household. He has learned to relax when he is instructed to do so. Contact us if you feel Byll could be a good match for you.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster.

Her previous foster states:\n\nThings that need work: She is mouthy, nibbles on your hands when excited and can nibble quite hard sometimes. Never out of aggression only out of excitement. She can be overbearing with love love. She loves to get up in your face and try to sit on your lap and lick your face. Which is great if she wasnt 75 pounds! She likes to show affection by licking...a lot! Shell lick your face, hands, arms, legs even with your jeans on she licks your jeans. Can be destructive if left unattended if shes bored. Not usually a problem if you give her plenty of toys and appropriate bones to chew on. \n\nThings to love about Blanche!: She gets along with all dogs, cats, horses, cows, all people. Maybe too overbearing for small kids and accidentally knock them down. She sticks around very close to you outside off leash and sometimes even tries to walk between your legs. Loves to play with other dogs and helps to make shy, insecure dogs feel more relaxed with her nonchalant, playful demeanor. Completely potty trained. Crate trained although shes not a fan and will spend the first 5 to 10 minutes whining and testing the gate to see if she can get out of it. \n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission.

            "description": "Ritz is a 3 yr old 55 lb German Shepherd/Akita mix. Ritz is awesome! He is dog friendly, cat friendly, all people friendly. We have not had him around small children only because my kids are all grown up and havent had any small friends over. I believe he would do great with small kids also. \n\nThings that need work: He gets too excited when he meets new people and jumps up and is overbearing. Once hes been around them for a little bit he calms right down and listens and uses his manners again. He does pull hard on a leash. Hes independent and will wander off a bit on adventures and has selective hearing when called back. But he stays close and sticks around our 5 acres really well. Can be grouchy/resource guard with other dogs when food is involved. Especially around his own bowl/kennel. \n\nThings to love about Ritz: Loves to play with toys/balls with people and other dogs. Doesnt guard toys, will offer toys to doggie friends to play tug o war with him. If you say mine he will drop the toy in your hand. Loves to play fetch with a ball! Very smart, independent thinker. He knows sit, shake, speak, and lay down although he doesnt lay down on command good at all. Completely house trained. Crate trained, will open the door with his paw or nose to go in and lay down. Not destructive when left alone uncrated. Loves to lay at the foot of the bed and sleep like a log at night. Loves to lay close and snuggle while you scratch his chest. \n\n Ritz makes awesome Chewbacca noises and talks a lot. In the mornings when he wakes up, hell stretch and make a loud Chewbacca noise like hes rolling his Rs with his tongue. He growl/talks when he is playing or when he wants attention or needs to go outside. It can sound aggressive when hes playing but hes only talking. \n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster. If all goes well, you can adopt during the same visit.\n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nThis bright eyed boy sure looks like a puppy but Rowdy is all grown up at 3 1/2 years old.  Rowdy has tested heartworm positive but there are less expensive options available which we\u2019d be happy to discuss with you.  This happy guy weighs right about 47 pounds and his adoption fee is $200.\n\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

            "description": "4 year old Pongo is so super sweet! He is a real gentleman and obviously very striking in the looks department! \nHe is nice to all he has met so far! He is very popular! We rescued him from a shelter in Indiana and we wonder how he ended up there. He is a happy go lucky goof ball, he seems house trained, and very walkable on a leash with a capable handler. \n\nWe would ideally like someone who has had this breed before but that is not required, but at the very least someone who has had and handled a large breed dog, as he can pull and jump up, etc. \n\nWe do recommend that any applicants research the breed, though. Dalmatians are known for being active, not hyper, but active in that they enjoy exercise and space! So we do not think an apartment placement is going to be the best for this guy.\n\nIf you are interested in Pongo, please apply today!",

I don't have much interest in toys, but love my stuffed Kongs and Kong Wobblers to keep me busy. I am very treat/food driven and need to work on taking them slowly and gently from humans. I am good with adults and my rescue would consider a home with experienced older children, but might be too much pup for younger kids. No cats due to my focus on resources. I may not be the best fit for an apartment, as my feelings get very hurt when my humans are not around and I bark to voice my displeasure of not being able to see my humans.No apartments.

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nThis beautiful girl is 18 month old Ella, a gorgeous GSD.  Ella\u2019s current weight is 64 pounds and her adoption fee is $250.\n\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

He does well with other dogs in a home environment. \nObservations with Cats: Clyde prefers to be in a home without cats.\nObservations with Kids: Clyde prefers to be in a home without children.House Training Progress: No accidents, but will have anxiety accidents when left alone.\nCrate Training Progress: Unknown\nLocation: DC area foster\nRescued From: Smyth County, VA\nAdditional Information: Clyde is 24 pounds of love and absolute devotion. He would do best in a single family home where his family loves going on long walks. Exercise is key for this little terrier guy. A home with a fenced yard is ideal but not required. Clyde is currently in training for separation anxiety and is working on not barking while crated. Clyde also needs a home where his new family is dedicated to working on his leash reactivty through exercise and training. While he is house trained (!) he may have anxiety accidents when left alone. He should not be in a home with cats. Despite his challenges, he's a very quick learner and has great potential to be the best boy when housed in the right environment! He is ridiculously sweet, devoted, and loving. Clyde looks forward to greeting you with tail wags, hind-leg circus dog dancing, and an abdunce of cuddles when you walk in the door. He can't wait to meet his forever family! Apply today to meet Clyde!\n\nClyde's rescue was sponsored by Gaby Richeimer in honor of her move to Clyde & Co.\n \n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon.\n\nApply for a CAT: www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adopt-a-city-kitty.html\n\nApply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\n \n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\n \n\nAdoption fees // Dogs - $395 (including puppies) unless noted; $200 for senior dogs // Cats - $150 (unless otherwise noted)\n\n \n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \n\nCat specific: Rabies, FVRCP, Feline Leukemia vaccines. They are tested for FIV and FeLV.\n\nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\n \n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\n \n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

            "description": "Barkley is a 1 year old 25lb mystery terrier mix who is looking for his person(s) to be experienced with dogs, dedicated, active and have a bag of never ending tennis balls. He's not going to be the right fit for most people, but he is going to be the most rewarding for one who is looking for someone special. Because he was a little complicated and super smart we enlisted the help of Instinct Training in Englewood NJ to help us decode this small fry. We're coming away with a better understanding of Barkley and he's leaving with a wealth of training under his belt. Barkley use to be reactive to all things outside, he's since learned how to take his cues from his trainer, to not overreact at everything on busy streets (maybe only at some things), he's also learned how to politely greet new people (ask him what the 'magic bowl' is), loose leash walking, and many other great foundation training skills. This is how the staff at Instinct describe Barkley: \"The entire staff at Instinct ADORE Mr. Barkley! He is definitely a huge part of the Instinct family. He loves his humans SO much, always ready to tackle us with kisses. Barkley has really come quite a way since his first day here. We are all very attached to this sweet boy and can you blame us?!\" Anyone who adopts Barkley will also definitely amass an album of funny dog photos too. He's got personality and smarts. Barkley will also come with 3 training lessons with an Instinct Trainer to help with his transition to home. home outside of the city, with no kids, adults only would be best. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. Make a commitment and a difference, apply to adopt Barkley here: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/SSRD/Dog",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00.

He is 53 lb.\nThey can live with other dogs.\nThey have not been tested with cats at our shelter yet.\n\nAlex & Andy are two happy, energetic pups who want to find a home together.\n\nThey really enjoy each other's company and seem to be bonded. They are always looking for the other if they aren't together.\n\nThey like to be outside together running around the yard and are learning how to play with toys. They play great with other dogs, too. They love to play chase and wrestle with their best dog friend, Lincoln.\n\nThey would make great adventure buddies once they have a little bit of leash training. They are active and fun but quiet indoors.\n\nWhen spending time with them in their room, they want to play with you and cuddle. They will immediately jump into your lap and give affection.\n\nThey are both very motivated by treats. Andy knows how to sit, Alex is still learning!\n\n--\n\nOur hours: In an effort to limit the number of visitors at our shelter during this time, visitors are limited to approved applicants only.\n\n\nInstructions on how to fill out our online application are on our website here: https://www.lighthouseanimalshelter.org/application-instructions\n\nWe are receiving a high number of applications at this time. Please be patient with us while we adjust to these new changes and keep in mind that our volunteers process the applications as quickly as their schedules allow.\n\nWe do not adopt on a first-come-first-serve basis, but rather by the best match between dog and family, although we will factor in the order of applications if there are equally good matches.\n\nHow you can help us process your application:\nPlease call all of your references (landlord, if applicable, vet(s) and personal references) before filling out an application to let them know that we will be calling. We are an all-volunteer program and volunteers often make reference calls from their cell phone. It will be a number your personal reference does not recognize. We understand most people will screen their calls from unknown numbers so please tell them to keep an eye on their voicemail and give the volunteer a call back at their earliest convenience. We may end up playing phone tag with your personal references but will reach out to you if we need further assistance in reaching them.\n\nHow we process your application:\nOnce we receive your application, we will check home ownership or landlord permission, personal references and vet references. We will reach out to you if we have questions during the process or if we are having trouble reaching your references either through email or phone. We will contact you when your application is fully processed to discuss how you would like to proceed with your application and to discuss dogs in our care who will be a good match for you and anyone involved in the adoption.\n\nOur adoption fee:\nOur adoption fee is $400 ($415 if paid by PayPal) which covers the costs of vetting (spay, vaccinations, heartworm testing, preventatives while in our care, deworming and microchip) and any boarding or transport fees incurred in each dog's rescue.",

Bandit often sees his role as protector and he tends to resource guard his person if allowed. Consequently, a strong, experienced owner is needed for this guy. He also can become over protective of his food and toys. For this reason, we do not recommend Bandit for a home with children. A quiet adult home is needed for Bandit.\n\nBandit is housebroken and likes car rides.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

We were told she is a mix of chihuahua and rat terrier, but only a DNA test will tell for sure,\n\nZOOEY is a super high-energy puppy who needs an active family who will walk her and play with her daily. She loves other dogs and she is currently being fostered in a home with 5 cats who she wants nothing more than to play with, but PLEASE NOTE: If you have a cat, it will need to be one who likes dogs and wants to play. Otherwise she will be too much for them. \n\nThe best part about ZOOEY is that she is extremely loving and cuddly. She believes herself to be a lap dog. She's the perfect size too. Big enough to go on long hikes, but small enough to still cuddle up with you.\n\nZOOEY can be a bit mouthy, and like most high-energy puppies will require training. After basic obedience she would excel in agility. \nZOOEY sleeps well in a crate and is house broken as long as you take her outside regularly.\n\nZOOEY is spayed, vaccinated for rabies and distemper, tested negative for heartworm and tick born illnesses, microchipped, and dewormed. If you are interested in giving ZOOEY her forever home please submit an application to adopt a dog online at passion4paws.org/adopt. She's waiting!",

            "description": "Alex & Andy are around 3 years old\nAlex is the tan boy. He is 57 lb.\nAndy is the brindle and white boy. He is 53 lb.\nThey can live with other dogs.\nThey have not been tested with cats at our shelter yet.\n\nAlex & Andy are two happy, energetic pups who want to find a home together.\n\nThey really enjoy each other's company and seem to be bonded. They are always looking for the other if they aren't together.\n\nThey like to be outside together running around the yard and are learning how to play with toys. They play great with other dogs, too. They love to play chase and wrestle with their best dog friend, Lincoln.\n\nThey would make great adventure buddies once they have a little bit of leash training. They are active and fun but quiet indoors.\n\nWhen spending time with them in their room, they want to play with you and cuddle. They will immediately jump into your lap and give affection.\n\nThey are both very motivated by treats. Andy knows how to sit, Alex is still learning!\n\n--\n\nOur hours: In an effort to limit the number of visitors at our shelter during this time, visitors are limited to approved applicants only.\n\n\nInstructions on how to fill out our online application are on our website here: https://www.lighthouseanimalshelter.org/application-instructions\n\nWe are receiving a high number of applications at this time. Please be patient with us while we adjust to these new changes and keep in mind that our volunteers process the applications as quickly as their schedules allow.\n\nWe do not adopt on a first-come-first-serve basis, but rather by the best match between dog and family, although we will factor in the order of applications if there are equally good matches.\n\nHow you can help us process your application:\nPlease call all of your references (landlord, if applicable, vet(s) and personal references) before filling out an application to let them know that we will be calling. We are an all-volunteer program and volunteers often make reference calls from their cell phone. It will be a number your personal reference does not recognize. We understand most people will screen their calls from unknown numbers so please tell them to keep an eye on their voicemail and give the volunteer a call back at their earliest convenience. We may end up playing phone tag with your personal references but will reach out to you if we need further assistance in reaching them.\n\nHow we process your application:\nOnce we receive your application, we will check home ownership or landlord permission, personal references and vet references. We will reach out to you if we have questions during the process or if we are having trouble reaching your references either through email or phone. We will contact you when your application is fully processed to discuss how you would like to proceed with your application and to discuss dogs in our care who will be a good match for you and anyone involved in the adoption.\n\nOur adoption fee:\nOur adoption fee is $400 ($415 if paid by PayPal) which covers the costs of vetting (spay, vaccinations, heartworm testing, preventatives while in our care, deworming and microchip) and any boarding or transport fees incurred in each dog's rescue.",

He is very affectionate once he knows you and can chase after a ball all day! Since he is a big boy we suggest a home that can handle all his energy and would have the time to work with him to teach him the manners he needs. We also think he would do better in a home with either no kids or older kids so he doesn't knock them over! Bayo is up to date on all vaccinations, neutered and microchipped! His adoption fee is $60.

His ideal day consists of lounging around, getting TONS of pets and love, and playing with his toys. Don't let his bark scare you, this guy doesn't have a mean bone in his body! We recommend a home with a queen sized bed or bigger. \n\nZuko is a special needs pup. He was found wandering, surviving on garbage for weeks. His front leg looks a little funny, and that's because it was broken and did not heal properly. He also has mild hip dysplasia. He has been thoroughly examined by a vet, and the only recommendations are joint supplements and maintaining an ideal weight.\n\nPlease apply now if you're interested in meeting our sweet friend!!",

He's the biggest of the litter and the ringleader. He would do best with another dog and does well with cats.\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available!

The family that found her took good care of her but realized she needed more attention than they could provide with 5 kids in their home.\n\nShelby is an awesome girl! She gets along well with other dogs and would do best with kids that are 13 and up. She is larger (69 lbs but could loose a few pounds). She is also house trained and can be crate too but she does not need to be. Shelby is spayed and up to date on all vaccines. She is Lyme positive, and is being treated for a second round with doxy. Shelby is just fine and does not have any Lyme symptoms but as in humans is can flare at times or go dormant. She will need an adopted that is willing and able to provide what she needs if it does ever become an issue.\n\n12/12 Shelby visited our pawsome friends at Doggos, Dog Park and Pub, and had a great time! She loves playing with the other pups! \n1/18 Shelby is doing great in her foster home and learning better leash walking skills. She does great with the other dogs in her foster and is ok with the cat but would do best in a home with no cats! \n\nIf you are interested in Shelby please apply at reddoffarm.com!",

He is very shy at first, especially with men, but once he knows you he runs into your lap immediately. He is a high energy dog who loves to run and play, and shows potential to play with other dogs as well. He can be tentative with new dogs, but enjoys playing and wrestling when he gets the chance! He shows potential to live in a home with another dog if it is a good fit. Since Steve can be shy at first, if there are children in the home they would need to be ages 13 and older. Steve is shy at first with men, and may take multiple visits for him to trust you, but with the help of some delicious treats he's your new best friend! \n\nIf Steve looks like the lovable pup that's missing from your life, give us a call at 234-212-9843 to schedule an appointment to meet him today!",

I'm the biggest lovebug, but I can be a little shy at times, so I'm looking for a family that can help me boost my confidence and help socialize me more with potential human and doggie friends. I'm so excited for all the adventures we'll go on! I've lived in a home before so I know a thing or two about being a good roommate and know a lot of my big girl manners already. I would love for you to bring the whole family down to meet me if I sound like the pup for you!\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy! Thanks to Chapman BMW Camelback you can take me home for FREE!\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL recommends I live with humans HIGH SCHOOL AGE and older.\nAAWL says I am SOCIAL with other dogs.\nAAWL says I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE, needing regular exercise.\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.",

He really does not enjoy other dogs playfulness.  He can be grumpy (snappy and snarly) when asked to do things he does not want to do.  Which is often a trait of these older apple heads.  He is super snuggly and loves to be on a lap or in bed with his person.  He is good about going potty out side (the only thing that is not chihuahua about him) .. He is Neutered and up to date on every thing.  His owner had to go into a retirement home and had to surrender Harley.  Harley loves to give kisses to the people he loves.  He tends to be a one person dog.  Easy to bathe",

A baby gate won't hold her back, but it isn't necessary as she's wonderfully behaved in the house and in her kennel.\n\nHetti loves snuggles and will require a furever family that is willing to spend endless hours curled up on a cozy couch or bed.

Adorable Ace, at 10 pounds and beautiful Baby at 6 pounds will warm your hearts and your home with their sweet, winning ways. Called the \"show pony\" by his fosters, Ace prances around like a show horse in the yard, jumps on their laps when they're working at their desks, snuggles with them under the covers, and LOVES taking rides in the car. Shier Baby needs some time before she lets herself be picked up, then cuddling becomes her passion followed by \"digging\" blankets on the couch or bed. Both get along easily with the resident cats, are famously fond of treats, (Ace eats mini Milk Bone biscuits and Baby eats soft treats), appear to be deaf and have few remaining teeth. Housetrained, with the occasional accident, this precious pair hopes to find fur-ever love in a tranquil home without children that will cherish them for the cuddly cuties they are.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet, the next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives! A home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for Ace and Baby is $150. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking here . We want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time. Our adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

            "description": "Meet \"Ranger.  He was found wandering the mountain trails by a wonderful family who took him in and gave him a place to stay while searching for his owners.  Ranger joined our foster program 9 months ago! He was shy and reserved at first but thanks to his finder & foster family he got a chance to change his story.  Ranger has now spent the last three months in basic training to learn to be a dog and is now ready for his forever home.  \n\nRanger will need ongoing confidence boosting and training. He is still shy but is worlds better than when he came to us. His trainer says his ideal home would be a single woman or a chill couple. He tends to gravitate more towards women. Ideally due to his shyness, a home without young children is best but teenagers would be fine.  This home would also be quiet but still up for taking him out to play, for walks and continuing his socialization. Ranger has done well with another dog previously, but has not spent a lot of time with other dogs since his training. The dogs he has met though, he has been friendly with! Ranger is crate trained and it is really important that his adoptive home keep up with crating him as it is his safe space. \n\nHe loves playing in his fosters fenced yard, but wants to be with his people. He does not like storms or loud noises but has gotten better with that over the time he's been with us. Ranger LOVES toys but will destroy them. He either needs supervised toy time or harder toys that he can't rip up and eat. He has been neutered, microchipped and is current on vaccines. Ranger is a great boy who has been given a second chance at a great life! If you are interested in giving this boy a forever home, please apply at reddogfarm.com!",

He is estimated to be a 10 year old Terrier mix. He is friendly and wants to be around people. He is fairly good with going to the bathroom outside but he will need taken out more frequently. He has cataracts in both eyes, severe perdiontitis, and a heart murmur. Despite his age and everything going on with him, Casper does show interest in toys still and will fetch short distance for you. \nWe will start accepting applications on him but he cannot leave until we get some bloodwork to be sure he can have dental work done as well as a neuter.\n\n*Serious inquiries only please*",

He has been in NEESSR foster care for a little over a month now, so we\u2019ve learned quite a bit about him. Duke loves his 3 mile daily walks and he LOVES attention from his people. His foster mom reports he also LOVES car rides, his stuffed toys and belly rubs.  His favorite treat is a large knuckle bone filled with peanut butter \u2013 keeps him busy for hours.  He does NOT like to share his home with other dogs and he does NOT like to be left alone! Duke has a history of skin & allergy issues which are now controlled by a strict diet including prescription dog food and the use of allergy medication. We are looking for an active adopter who can provide Duke much love and exercise.\n\nPLEASE NOTE \u2013  REQUIREMENTS FOR ADOPTING DUKE: \n***He MUST be the only dog in the home. If you have doggy visitors or need to board your dog in a facility or home with other dogs, he is not the dog for you.\n*** He MUST be kept on the prescription dog food and allergy meds.\n*** His adopter MUST be home a great deal of the time. Adopter should be retired or work-from-home permanently\n\nIf you already are on our adoption waiting list and are interested in learning more about Duke please email neessr@gmail.com.  Otherwise please read about our adoption policies and then complete our application.  https://essrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html\n\nNEESSR adopters must live in New England or New York state and we do not accept applicants with children under the age of 5.",

Hershey is a little over a year old and weighs 33 pounds, a great family size pet!  Hershey has a great little personality, is very loving and playful.  She loves playing with other dogs and is just a really good girl.  Hershey is still young and has a lot of energy so an active family and a fenced yard would be great for safe playtime.  Hershey has a beautiful deep chocolate coat and definitely has a lot of Lab in her, cute as can be!  She is in a wonderful foster home where she is social with other dogs and housetrained.\nHershey has been spayed, microchipped, is up to date on all vaccinations and on monthly heartworm, flea and tick prevention.\nFor more information on our adoption process and to complete an application, please visit our website at www.allaboutdogscr.com or contact us by email at allaboutdogscr@gmail.com",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nLittle Miss Lola is an adorable 10 month old Shar Pei mix youngster.  Puppies are puppies and crate training is the best way to raise a young one.  Lola\u2019s current weight is about 20 pounds and her adoption fee is $200.\n\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

Roo especially loves cuddling with her people and will even rub up against you like a cat!\n\nAnother one of Roo's favorite things is chasing squirrels or birds (and barking at them). She also loves plush, squeaky, or crinkly toys but isn't a huge fan of loud noises like fireworks. \n\nRoo is housebroken, but she needs regular potty breaks (who doesn't?)\n\nIf you'd like to meet this girl, please reach out to the shelter!",

She is really a good girl weighing 11 lbs.   She rides well in the car and is good with big or small kids.   Cassie is friendly. She is house trained and crate trained.  However she will need to learn a new routine so she may have accidents in your house.    She likes baths. She does not like to be squeezed too hard.    She understands the words, come, sit no, stay and down.    She likes to go on walks. She is a little hesitant with women, but ultimately is okay.    She is sweet and cuddly.   We just had her teeth done ( dental). She lost 14 teeth but she is now hoping somebody will adopt her and allow her to live the rest of her life ina warm cozy bed in her with her family.  \n\n\nIf you would like to fill out an application online, you can go to our website at www.arf-fresno.com, click on the Adoption Section and complete the application.      \n\nAnimal Rescue of Fresno is located at 4545 East Dakota Ave., Fresno, CA 93726 Visit our website, facebook fan page or call us for our current ours.

            "description": "PAWS is currently closed due to COVID-19.  The animals are receiving the same high level of care as always.  During this time, we are taking application over the phone.  Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nThis bright eyed boy is 3 1/2 year old Cooper.  He\u2019s an Aussie mix and prone to be a bit of an escape artist so we\u2019ve been told so a secure yard or leash walk would be required.  Cooper has tested heartworm positive but there are less expensive options available which we\u2019d be happy to discuss with you.   Cooper only weighs about 29 pounds.  His adoption fee is $200.\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

            "description": "Hi there, Im Red! Im a lovely soul. Because, no matter what Ive been through in my life, Im happy and content in the here and now. I just want to play and have fun and enjoy every single minute of every single day that were together. My smile and my spirit will help brighten your day and your life too, if you just give me a chance.\nIm an adorable, 6-year-old, 83-pound sweetheart with a beautiful smile and a truly delightful personality. And I think I must be at least partially housebroken, because I keep my kennel clean and I know to go to the bathroom when I get outside. Please stay patient with me when we get home though and remember that Im trying my best to follow all the rules of my new home. I came to Wayside as a transfer from a shelter in New Orleans when they didnt have room for me. Lucky for me, I never, ever have a bad day, so I took the trip in stride. Youll notice I have a few scars left over from my previous life, including on my left eye, but none of that bothers me a bit. Im all about the fun, celebrating the day, and living each new day to the fullest.\nIve been at the shelter for awhile now, so I recently enrolled in a training program. Its so much fun! Im learning basic commands and manners in a positive, focused way. I love the extra time and attention I get from my training partner! Im one smart cookie and I pick up on things quickly. I hope you will continue to train me throughout my life. And please stay patient and calm with me as I learn what you expect from me.\nIm loose and friendly and relaxed and calm when meeting new people. I love to be by your side! When one of my favorite volunteers stops by to visit me, I greet her with my favorite ball. We go out to the play yard, where I carefully line all my balls up in preparation for a great game of fetch. Toys and balls and fetch and playing are things that bring me so much joy, its hard for me to put into words. Im pretty sure I will make you smile and laugh all day long at my silly antics. Im an expert at making you as happy as you make me. \nEveryone around Wayside talks about what a hidden gem I am. They like to spend time with me because Im an easy dog to love, in addition to my happy, fun, social, affectionate personality. I love to go for daily walks and I do well on my leash. Im a strong dog though, so I like to use a harness to keep me from pulling. After a walk and my play time, theres nothing that brings me happiness like cuddling with you on the couch. Ill make such a nice companion for you! Im looking for a home as your only dog. And I need a home with kids over the age of at least 6. I can get pretty focused on my toys and I need people in my life who can understand that.\nIm just a simple dog looking for a family to share my life with. I wont ask for much and Ill be happy and grateful for all the little things that come with being part of a family. Ill show you how it feels to be loved unconditionally and Ill teach you the beauty of living and appreciating whatever the moment holds.\nLove, Red\n ...",

Adult weight of the puppies should be around 40 lbs. Puppies were born on 10/26/20. The puppies were born black but are starting to get a brown tinge on their fur. \n\nWe require a fenced in back yard ( physical fence) and our policy is no small children under the age of 5. Puppies needs a home where a primary adult caretaker is home during the day. If you have another dog in the home a meet in greet may be required. Puppies are up to date on vaccinations and microchipped. We are trying to schedule her to be spayed right now, but the vets are really booked. Adoption fee is $300 , if she is not spayed adopter will sign a legal and binding spay/neuter agreement and we will refund $75 of the adoption fee when proof of spay is provided.

Lucy is 7 yrs old, active and fun loving and is looking for a family that is the same. She likes to go for walks, car rides play in the yard, but she also is satisfied sitting in the backyard and chilling with her friends.\n\nLucy would prefer to be the focus of your attention soaking up as much love as possible.  Cats are unknown and because of her size, she requires a 6 ft fenced in yard and would love to play with kids 12 years of age and up. \n\nShe has lived a somewhat difficult and sheltered life but you wouldn't know it by her happiness. And now, Lucy is ready to make up for lost time.\n\nIf you are interested in Lucy, contact us at adoptions@suncoastanimalleague.org",

She is housetrained and crate trained, but is a submissive urinator when she gets excited. Ziggy knows sit, stay, come, lie down, and walks well on leash. She is prone to ear infections and was given up by her owner. Adopted animals are not able to go to their new home until spay and neuter surgery has been done.  Adoptions are first come first serve, and no appointment is needed. \nWhen asking about an animal, please be sure to use the animal identification number that starts with A.",

I love the movie Elf, because I identify with one of the quotes: I just like to smile, smiling's my favorite! Don't I have a good smile? I also enjoy long, relaxing walks to the fridge. I'm a real foodie and I appreciate tasty snacks. (But really, who doesn't like snacks??) I like to think I'm the life of the party! If you need some companionship to brighten up your winter, consider adopting me. I'd love to meet you.",

But she's catching on that she is not the alpha, and is treat motivated so she is learning new tricks. \nShe LOVES to PLAY!  She needs a dog her size or bigger that doesn't mind her tackling them. Needs a big walker or someone that is very active.  If left alone to get bored she'll chew things up.\nShe turns 2 years old in May. bark.\nNo apartment life for her either.  She'll bark if left alone. \nNo invisible fence, no doggie door, or tie out, but then no dog in our rescue will be treated in that way. It is dangerous to let your dogs outside unattended. \nCats? No small kids, older ones with dog experience. \nPlease email us at ohioeskierescue@outlook.com for an application. \nWe do not adopt out our dogs to far from the rescue incase things don't work out. Our dogs always remain part of the OAER family.\nWe took her from the Wayne County Dog Shelter here in Ohio.",

He knows basic commands such as sit, stay, come, lie down, and he walks well on leash. He can be a bit overprotective, so he would likely do best in a calm household without frequent visitors. He was given up by his owner due to a landlord issue. Adopted animals are not able to go to their new home until spay and neuter surgery has been done.  Adoptions are first come first serve, and no appointment is needed. \nWhen asking about an animal, please be sure to use the animal identification number that starts with A.",

I am a very happy girl.  I am all wagging butts for people, dogs, and cats.  I am very playful and active but I also settle well.  While I live with a cat now, because of my playfulness I probably wouldn\u2019t be a good match for dog-skittish cats or older cats that want to be left alone.  I am doing pretty well with housebreaking, but I submissive pee if you try to pick me up.  I am still figuring out the stairs, but my foster parents are confident I will master them soon.  I am looking for an active family who can keep me entertained (and I promise to do the same for you).  A fenced in yard is a requirement especially with children in the house.  I am still getting comfortable in my foster home,  I just arrived on 1/30/21, so my foster parents will know more about me soon.\n\n",

She's a shy girl who will need an understanding family to help her build her confidence, but she loves fiercely, and we just know she'll make someone very happy. She is only 7 months old so she is a blank slate ready to learn how to be a good girl. \n\nWhile she technically can still be shedding this virus for another 4 weeks, we feel as though she is healthy enough to find her new family. We will require that any currently owned dogs be up to date on vaccinations if you\u2019re thinking of adopting. This girl has been cooped up for weeks during her quarantine and treatment so she will need a family that is willing to give her time to adjust to being a regular pup. However, we would recommend not taking her out into any public setting for the next few months, disposing of any poop immediately, and not bringing another un-vaccinated dog into your home for up to 2 years.  \n\n\n1820 Princeton Rd\nHamilton OH 45011\n(513) 867-5727 ext 0\n\nTo submit an app online, email it to animalservices@butlercountyohio.org\n\nSophie is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

He has lived with children and other dogs and they report he is housebroken.  From what we have observed we don't think he would do well with small dogs or cats. He did very well when he met a large dog.  He is a giant goofy boy that thinks he's a lap dog and will try and climb up into your lap.  He is very tall and would most likely be able to climb out of most fences so supervision will be needed if he is in a fenced in yard. Wyatt can not go to an apartment and he needs an adopter who has Great Dane experience due to his size and energy level.\n\nWyatt is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

She was a breeding machine at first and once she was no longer in desirable age she was destined for the meat market. Everything changed for her when an amazing rescue in China saved her life and started working with American rescues to get her out. She was one of the 21 pugs brought over by PugHearts in early January of 2021.\n\nDespite her rough life her spirit is not broken in the slightest. She loves toys, other dogs but above all her humans. We call her happy bunny because she has the softest fur I have ever felt and she just hops around happily all day. Because this is her first experience of ever being in a house we are working on potty training but to our absolute delight she loves her crate and never has an accident in it.\n\nAs far as her health is concerned, she came to us with a UTI and some fold dermatitis but both are resolving nicely. She does have dry eyes and will need drops for life. She has some mild vision impairment but gets around just fine. Her paws are deformed forever from living in a crate with no bottom so they appear swollen all the time, not that it stops her from hopping. She does have luxating patellas in both her back legs so she is a bit bow legged, it honestly just adds to her charm. She will need her nares and soft palate corrected which is scheduled for February 16th. Once that is completed, this girl is ready for the one last move, to a home that will love her until the end of her days.\n\nWhoever ends up with this sunshine of a girl will have something truly special. Until then we will love on her a little extra to try to make up for what she's been through.",

He will give you lots of love and fun if you just give him a chance!\n\nSpike is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER.

He is currently in foster care in the south bay area and is learning a daily routine and structure. He needs a leader to temper his curious nature and enthusiasm for life. We do not recommend that his next home has cats or other small animals as he is reactive. Like most young dogs, Miko loves to play, especially with balls, a Kong comes in at number 2. Miko will thrive in a home where he is the center of attention and can be someones plus one. He wants to be with his person 24/7, a real people pup.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or finding more information about Miko or our other dogs, please read about our adoption process and fill out the application at: www.westcoastboxerrescue.org/adopt\n\nGet to know us:\n\nhttps://www.westcoastboxerrescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WestCoastBoxerRescue\n\nPlease follow us on our Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/WestCoastBoxerRescue.",

They love each others company, like to go on walks together and are just more confident together. \n\nWe are not going to lie - these tow are wild!! Imagine two boys who have never been shown love, or taught manners. They will need some work and patience. That said, they will be SO worth the investment. They are just looking for love, affection and stability. \n\nThe pups are here in RI. They are both about 2 years old and 40 pounds and are fully vetted.

She is very shy but very sweet if you go slow with her. We are unsure how she is with other animals at this time although she appears to be fine with other dogs. She would do best in a home with children 15 years of age and older. She would like to live the rest of her life in a calm home with not a whole lot of commotion. She wants all the love someone will give her. You need to go slow with her or she will submissively pee, we are hoping with time and love and trust she will stop doing this but it could be a life long issue. She is spayed, up to date on shots, and microchipped.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $200\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting this pet please check out out website at https://rbhspets.org/adopt/\nWhen you scroll down the page you will see a application link in green.

He is definitely a velcro pug and loves to be with you as much a possible.  His tongue sticks our just a bit all the time but does not interfere with his eating or drinking.  Andrew crates well and is super good with kids.  He is scheduled for neuter in December and should be ready after that.  We are still working on the marking in the house but he's making progress and it should improve with his neuter.  He is an easy going, loving dog that would make a great addition to any family.",

She loves her dog bed, toys and chewing on firewood (LOL). She listens well and is able to be trained and learn tricks-she can play dead, roll over and shake. She loves splashing around in the pool but does not like to swim. She loves rolling around in the grass, going on walks and riding in the car. Due to some unpredictable and rare aggressive behaviors, we think she would fit best in a home without any other animals or kids.\nIf you are interested in submitting an adoption application for me please go here: https://www.danehaveninc.com/adoption-application\n1/24/21 12:41 PM",

He would probably do best in a home with no other dogs, but if you have other dogs a meet and greet is required.  \n\nOliver is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

She gets so excited when she first meets new people that she tends to jump on them so she would probably do best in a home with kids over 10.  A fenced in yard  would be ideal.  She responds very well to positive training using treats and will sit on command.\n\nCarrie is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER.

My name is Cypress and I am a 2 year old German Shorthair mix. I made my way to MaxFund as a stray with my brother. My start here was rough as I had a hard time getting comfortable with my new surroundings. At first, I was having a hard time trusting people and would often get nervous and scared. As a good boy in training I've been working on trusting people and other dogs. With the help of my trainer and brother I have gotten much more comfortable with everything. My brother found his forever home and now I am ready to find mine!\n\nDue to my prior nervousness my potential owners will need to schedule time to meet me multiple times before I can go home. I will need to learn to get comfortable with my new family. I will need to continue with my training in order to become a top notch canine citizen. I can not go to a home with children who are under 16 years old.\nI am a very smart boy and even know how to sit. I like to play fetch, be outside, and most importantly goof around. Tennis balls are my favorite but I'm not picky when it comes to my toy time!\n\nAny potential adopters must become temporary volunteers just to volunteer with me.\n\nAre you sold yet? If you still need me to convince you, come on down to the dog shelter and let my smile charm you in person! Please call the dog shelter at 303.595.4917 to make an appointment.\n\n\nMaxFund is a physical shelter located at 1005 Galapago St in Denver, Colorado.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a dog, please call 303-595-4917 or come into the dog shelter.\nThis PetFinder account is managed by volunteers, and the most up-to-date information is at the shelter.\nHow our adoption process works:\n1. You MUST come into the shelter to meet a dog you are interested in (and meet a few others, while you\u2019re at it!)\n                We do not require appointments \u2013 come anytime during normal business hours.\n                Our hours are 10-5 Mon, Wed, Thu Fri / 11-5 Saturday / 12-5 Sunday\n                We suggest you call ahead to be sure the dog(s) do not have pending applications\n2. You will fill out your adoption application, including references, after finding a dog you\u2019d like to adopt\n3. The application review and reference checks will take up to 3-5 business days; you will not be able to bring a dog home same-day\n                We only take 2 applications per dog, before they are unavailable. This is why we suggest you call ahead to check the status of the pup!\n \nWe do not adopt out-of-state.\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

She was rescued from there and brought into a home who has just realized he is not equipped for a puppy.   So onward and upward.  New foster home, more training!\n\nHeidi is extremely social, plays nicely with all other dogs and loves her humans.   She loves fetch, zoomies, car rides and water.    She is not fond of her crate and is learning how to behave on leash.    She is so smart\u2026.huge improvement over the last week.    And she likes discipline and routine.   It gets her brain working.\n\nLab puppies are lots of work.   They are high energy and need exercise and walks.    Heidi is no exception.    She needs an adopter who is committed to keeping her active, happy and continuing her training.    They may be a lot of work but they thrive on learning and training.\n\nThink about it.   Don\u2019t just go on her gorgeous looks.    If you are up for the task, Heidi is ready to give you lots of love and good times!\n",

He is the best of both worlds; able to play on his own, or be your cuddly lap dog. Elvis is super cute with eyebrows full of expressions!\n\nHe loves to play with his toys but he\u2019ll keep a watchful eye for when you sit down, then he\u2019s in full cuddle mode!  His favorite place is snuggled into your arm; he\u2019ll give you kisses and fall blissfully asleep.\n\nElvis doesn\u2019t react too strongly to anything, except abrupt movements, which do startle him.  He may react with a little squeal, but nothing more.  He is also learning to share his toys \u2013 he has never had them before so his furry foster brother is showing him the ropes on sharing.  He has a great appetite and patiently waits for his foster siblings to finish eating before going to lick their bowls.  He is house-trained and crate-trained. \n \nElvis is up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped and being maintained on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  \n\nThis dog is currently being fostered as part of Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue. An application is required, along with a home visit and small adoption fee.  Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. **FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED**\n\nPlease visit us on our Facebook page for additional photos, give us a like while you're there! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondsintheruffNC\n\nAll of our dogs are fostered in homes and are INDOOR dogs. We believe all dogs are family members and should be treated as valued members of the household. \n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines for further information on adopting from Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue before submitting an application. www.DITRnc.com.\n\n\n.",

DOB 12-10-10), female, 38 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. This poor girl was found abandoned and homeless in NC in rough shape. She was out of time and we could not bare the thought of this sweet soul losing her life unloved in an overcrowded shelter! We saved her! She has had full vetting including removing numerous \"surface\" masses after our Vet said the surgery was safe and recommended (not sent to lab). Puddin tested well with other dogs offering soft tail wags. Although she is a bit hard of hearing and her sight is not 20/20 she loves to explore and seems very grateful to have been saved. Puddin is looking for her happily ever after............finally. Is that with your family? Stay tuned for more information as Puddin is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Puddin please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue.

Ranger is full of energy with an addiction to toys, the louder the better. He has requested that his special family be able to supply him with lots of fun toys to keep him busy and happy. He will need a fenced yard, a family that is home more than not, a kid to play with would be a plus, another dog with similar energy who will allow him to be the toy hog or he would do fine as an only, a family that will allow him to sleep in bed with them and hangout on the furniture. Ranger loves walks, he is super fast, has zero street smarts and fears nothing going by so a harness and a strong handler would be best. Ranger has done phenomenal recovering from surgery after being hit by a vehicle but does have some needs as a result. He can not urinate when he tries but wears a belly band and urine releases when he barks, sits or lays down. He has zero issues with wearing his fancy pants. Ranger also has trouble when pooping, it takes him time and on occasion releases on its own when he barks. He will need his family to be understanding of his special needs. Ranger is a happy dog who loves to give kisses and be near his humans, he will truly be a great addition to the perfect home. Applications are available on our website\nwww.onedogatatime.us\n.",

Since then, she has gained plenty of weight and rehabilitated beautifully! \n\nDespite what she has been through, she is a very gentle soul with a heart of gold. She absolutely adores people and attention - she can't get enough! She is sweet, gentle, and despite having only a few teeth, she loves treats. She would love a home where she can hang out with her people and live the good life. \n\nAt the refuge, she has her own room and is able to stay free in it, instead of being crated. She is a chill girl in her room and doesn't make a mess! \n\nShe is fully blind but adapts amazingly to her environment. At her foster, she navigates the steps, which took her just a couple days (and a few meatballs)  to learn. She boogies around the yard and her foster tells her \u201cuh uh uh\" when she gets near a tree.  She leaps in a car perfectly and follows her person around the yard by the sound of their footsteps. She adapts so well, you'd even find yourself questioning if she really is indeed blind (she is).\n\nShe is getting her heartworm treatment - which is covered by the rescue - and will be spayed afterwards. She has a cyst on her ovary that will be removed with the spay. \n\nThis sweet girl is an absolute gem! She knows she is a star and is so happy to be living her best life now. Little does she know it is about to get even better! Apply now at www.LuckyDogRefuge.com \n\nREAD THE FOLLOWING FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR THIS PET:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.LuckyDogRefuge.com, under the \u201cApply Now\u201d tab \n\nor \n\nat https://forms.gle/LXKMKSnagxLSad668.\n\n- Do NOT use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible. If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES.\n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

The boy was extremely fond of Friday and would not stop pestering him.   Fortunately, Mom saw a problem brewing and contacted us to take in Friday.\n\nWe were more than happy to have this hunk in the Squad.\n\nHe knows some commands, is great on leash and appears to have no issues with other dogs.    Friday is a snuggler and a great fan of belly rubs.\n\nThis guy is going to make someone a great companion.   We adore him.\n",

He has a ton of energy so will need to be in an active environment and a fenced yard is recommended. He is in need of training. He pulls on the leash and jumps up when excited. Dobby came to the shelter with his good buddy Hercules and the two of them are very fond of each other, sleeping together, playing together. We do separate them for feeding as Hercules will push Dobby away from his food and eat it himself. Note: We'd love to send Dobby and Hercules to the same home but recognize that is a lot of dog to take on. Please call the shelter at 519-372-1911 for an appointment to meet this great guy. Note: at this point we are only making appointments with people from within Grey Bruce.",

Make an appointment to meet her today.\n\nRuby is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER.

Here is his video in NC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_89NWbvNc7c\n\nCarson is 2 years old (approx. DOB tbd), male, 48 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Carson was found as a homeless stray in North Carolina with embedded collar scars on the underside of his neck. We don't think Carson was ever truly loved; he is so loves attention and seeks affection! He is very friendly with other dogs and assessed well during introductions. He is an energetic happy boy that would love a family of his own! He is jumpy currently so probably best older children. Stay tuned for more information as Carson is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Carson please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He doesn't like to be alone so will need a home where he isn't left alone. He also has a ton of energy so will need to be in an active environment and a fenced yard is recommended. Large breed experience would be an asset. He isn't recommended for a family with small children because of his size and energy level. He also is in need of training. He pulls on the leash and jumps up when excited. Hercules came to the shelter with his good buddy Dobby and the two of them are very fond of each other, sleeping together, playing together. We do separate them for feeding as Hercules will push Dobby away from his food and eat it himself. Note: We'd love to send Dobby and Hercules to the same home but recognize that is a lot of dog to take on. Please call the shelter at 519-372-1911 for an appointment to meet this great guy. Note: at this point we are only making appointments with people from within Grey Bruce.",

            "description": "We're Dani's puppies and ready to find our forever families. We were born on 11/6/2020. Our mom, Dani, appears to be a rat terrier mix, but we do not know the daddies' breed. Based on the way some of us look, we think possibly a Doxie/mix. We think we will be smaller dogs, as mom is 12-13 pounds and we weight 4 to 8 pounds now. The 2 boys, Berlin and Dublin, are bigger than the girls. \nAlthough we are \"puppylicious\" and cuteness overload, make no mistake about it-WE ARE A LOT OF WORK! We are like infants without diapers. We have sharp teeth and nails, and sometimes can unintentionally scratch you. We eat puppy kibble 3-4 times a day and need access to water all day. We do our best to use our puppy pads, but sometimes we forget. We tear apart our toys and anything we think may be a toy! We will need to be socialized, housebroken, obedience trained, leash trained, cuddled, kept safe and loved, so we can become wonderful family members. We will go through a teething process and when the time is right we are required by AHF to get spayed/neutered. Our mom, Dani, was lucky and through wonderful rescues found a foster home to have her babies in a safe, comfortable environment. Others, with unplanned pregnancies, are not as fortunate.\n. We will be better family members if we also go to some training after we get all our vaccinations. Since we are small dogs we would do better with families without young, little children. Older children and people over 21 are OK. We would do OK in a condo/apartment or a home. If the adopters are renting or have an HOA, the document will need to be available at the time of adoption to make sure we meet their pet requirements. AHF also requires adopters use a Martingale collar, and because we are small a harness-double leashing, so we can't accidently escape and get away. We should never be left unattended outside as our mom, Dani, is quite a good jumper, as a rat terrier may also be a digger, and because of the local wildlife and larger birds (hawks and eagles). AHF also requires a home visit prior to adoption and a meet/greet with other animals in the family. We have never met a cat. \nIf you are interested, please fill out and submit an application. Only qualified applicants will be considered. Due to Covid guidelines, we will initially conduct phone interviews and then schedule a home visit/meet and greet. Once it's a match, the adopters will need to go to the PetCo in Bloomingdale on Army Trail Road, Saturday between 11 and 2 to sign the paperwork with an Adoption Counselor. \nThe adoption fee is $475 which includes deworming, microchipping, 3 sets of puppy shots, rabies and neuter when old enough. After his/her neuter, you will get a $55 refund.\nEmail: puppies@almosthomefoundation.org\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the suburbs surrounding Schaumburg (Illinois Residents only)\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

            "description": "Love for Life Program:\n\nThe dog you are interested in is eligible for our Love for Life program (L4L).  This program is to find forever foster homes for dogs that may not otherwise find a forever home.  Many are more difficult for adoption due to medical or behavioral conditions.  You can read more about our Love for Life program on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/love-for-life-program/.\n\nPlease meet the newest member of our Love For Life Program~\nTemperance (Tempe) came to us as a stray that wondered onto someone's property in Tucson and that person reached out to a friend that knew about our rescue. He reached out to us after holding onto her for a couple of days then drove her to our rescue from Tucson.  This middle-aged girl was so skinny and weak, but also had a very bloated belly. Within a couple of hours we had her into the vet that informed us her belly was full of rocks, trash, bones, and even Christmas tree ornament hooks! This poor girl was so hungry she was eating anything she could find.  \n\nSo the path of getting this girl healthy started. With the help of all the volunteers at the rescue, she slowly started to get better. As time went on, we found out she is diabetic, which now means small amounts of insulin twice a day along with a controlled diet.  With the diabetes, Tempe started losing her eye sight, which sadly resulted in having to have one of her eyes removed. We believe she can slightly see shadows with the other eye. \n\nWith all of that going on with this special girl, it does not stop her from having fun. She loves toys... especially balls.  She loves to go on walks and is just all around a happy girl. She loves to be with her person, so we think someone home a lot would be best for her. Because of her limited eyesight, we're not sure how she would do around other dogs, so she would probably be happiest as an only dog.\n\nWe are looking for a Love For Life foster home for Tempe.  As a foster, all necessary supplies and food would be provided for you by the rescue.  Tempe deserves to spend the rest of her days in a home of her own, with people of her own to love.  Are you that person?\n\nIf you think you could give this precious girl a soft place to land, please fill out the foster application below:\nhttp://www.savingpawsrescueaz.org/foster/\n\nWe will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization. We are not compensated for our time. Many volunteers juggle family and full -time careers while volunteering at Saving Paws. It may take up to 5 days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.",

She loves her daily walks and walks well on leash. She seems to be more secure with a dog buddy on her walk.\n\nPeanut is house trained  and even taught herself to use the doggie door within 5 days. She\u2019s quiet in her crate. She will go in on her own with some treats. \n\nPeanut is about 18 months old. She's spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. She tested negative for heartworms and is taking heartworm prevention. She weighs about 36 lbs and has a docked tail.\n\nThanks for considering a dog from Texas Cattle Dog Rescue! We place heelers all over the state of Texas.\n\nIf you're interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application. You can download it at www.texascattledogrescue.com/adopt.html. Our standard adoption fee is $250 +tax for adult dogs, $300 +tax for puppies. Our dogs will be spayed or neutered, vaccinated and heartworm tested before going to a new home. We conduct a home visit to help match up the right dog with the right owner.

When Priscilla entered the shelter she was happy and friendly. Sadly, with the stress of shelter life, she became reactive and excited to the barking dogs. We sent her to The Mannered Mutt for training. She is making great progress there, but we worry that if she comes back to the shelter, she will regress. We will arrange for potential adopters to meet Priscilla at the training facility. This wonderful dog has spent too many months without her very own family. Will you please consider giving Priscilla the home she craves and deserves!\n\nPlease email dogadoptteam@aartexas.org to schedule an appointment to meet Priscilla.\n\n\nEst. DOB: 2/1/19\n42 lbs.\nAAR does not transport for adoption.",

I don\u2019t exactly have the greatest past, but I know I can have the best future with you.\n\nWhile in foster care, I have learned quite a bit about living in a home.\u00a0 I am getting pretty good at potty training - and if you have some patience, a schedule, and some hot dogs, you shouldn\u2019t expect many accidents!\u00a0 I do a great job, once I know where I am supposed to go.\u00a0 I am learning to walk on a leash and don\u2019t really pull at all.\u00a0 I just want to be beside you while walking.\u00a0 My foster parents say I am the brave one - and I like to explore new things.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t had issues with chewing things I am not supposed to, but foster mom keeps everything picked up.\u00a0 At night I sleep in a crate without issues.\u00a0 I did have one night separate from my brother and I cried a bit, but when my foster sister went into the crate adjacent to mine, I was just fine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn foster care, I have lived with my brother, Hulk.\u00a0 If you want to adopt us both, you will not be disappointed.\u00a0 We play together well and he makes the best wrestling partner.\u00a0 If we go to separate homes, that is okay too.\u00a0 I have not had issues with other dogs and am getting along fairly well with cats.\u00a0 They sort of ignore me and I am confused by them - so no issues!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI look forward to a lifetime of adventures and cuddles with you and promise to nuzzle you and be by your side in good times and bad!\n\nThank you for your interest in a rescued pet! Due to Covid-19 we are now open by appointment. If you would like to set up a time to meet one of our pets, please fill out an adoption application here: www.midwestanimalresq.org/app\n\nOnce we receive your application, we will be in touch to schedule a time for you to come and meet the pet. Thanks again for your interest in a rescued pet, and for being flexible in these changing times.\n\nAll of our adult pets go on a 2 week trial adoption to make sure they are a perfect fit for your family!",

(We tried) These days, her bum is mostly in place. The major concern of infection is gone, and for the most part she LOOKS normal. But sadly, she was left with a rather severe and particularly unpleasant lasting effect. She is completely incontinent. She cannot hold her urine, or feces, and must be diapered, unless of course outside, or confined to an area where her uncontrolled bladder and bowel movements are not an issue.

Due to a possible genetic defect (most likely) to an untreated parasitic infection (probably a lending factor) she had a prolapsed rectum that neither medications, nor surgery could repair. (We tried) These days, her bum is mostly in place. The major concern of infection is gone, and for the most part she LOOKS normal. But sadly, she was left with a rather severe and particularly unpleasant lasting effect. She is completely incontinent. She cannot hold her urine, or feces, and must be diapered, unless of course outside, or confined to an area where her uncontrolled bladder and bowel movements are not an issue. I repeat- ignore cute Boston puppy face and read- SHE MUST BE DIAPERED. Forever.",

We are operating on an appointment system due to Covid-19. Once approved a appointment will be arranged. The application can be found on the RAWL website www.rawldogs.org  if you have questions please email inforawldogs@gmail.com or by calling 540-937-3336 between the hours of 7:30-1 (except Wed & Sun)\n\n\nMax came to RAWL as a transfer from one of our shelter partners. His history before that is unknown.\n\nI will be blunt. Max will not be homed to apartments, condo's, townhouses or a suburbia.  He is a working dog that requires the knowledge of a previous working or herding breed dog owner. He requires thinking exercise not mindless running for miles. It only turns him into a marathon runner. If he is challenged and worked using his brain he is happy and settled. He will not be placed in a home with children under 12. \n\n\nWith the above stated. The good about Max. He is smart, fun and high pecking order. He is easy to train but will also test to see if you really mean it. He is loyal and respectful of those who he deems worthy. He is affectionate. His brain is on and ready to do something. He would be incredible at agility. \n\nHe is not dog aggressive but is dog dominant. His toys are his toys he does not want to share them with other dogs. He does drop his toys on command for his handler. He knows sit, down and paw. \n\nIf you have had Border Collies or the like you will appreciate his temperament. I personally find him to be a quick study who wants to learn and to keep learning. \n\n\n\n",

Right now she is a big crybaby that calms down the second she is held! Either she\u2019s very spoiled and knows how to work it, or just scared and confused at the moment. She will settle down when she feels safe and gets into a routine. \n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and deworming.\nPlease contact foster parent Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email adbadoptions@yahoo.com.

He has the biggest grin, and greets you with all his teeth when he smiles. He gets along with all the dogs here at the rescue. He is crate and leash trained. He was a breeder dog, and the owner had too many dogs, so he ask us to take Golden boy. He has been a joy to have at Richardson Rescue. He has been neutered, dewormed, brought up to date on all vaccines, Heart worm negative, micro chipped, and ready for his forever home, where he can be a couch potato instead of being breed all of the time. Please fill out an adoption application at Richardsonrescue.org, if you need a loving boy to be apart of your life.",

She finally settled down in a quiet neighborhood of Hammond where she stayed for 4 weeks. All the neighbors fed her and watched for her as she aimlessly roamed the streets, just surviving. Animal Control finally got her to safety where she was warm, fed, and getting petted daily. \nLets keep this part short..... young boy walks in to animal control and insists on \"that one\". Suddenly this wandering homeless canine has a collar on, endless conversations to listen to, and a christmas tree to wake up to in the mornings. She is here with us, at 2x2 Rescue, learning to be a functioning family member. 2021 will be her best year yet. . . . we promised that to her. She now plays, loves other pets, and is learning leash manners. Wander will take a little longer to settle in to a new home than a \"normal dog\" would but she is beyond worth it!\n52 pounds, 4 years old Australian Kelpie",

This girl will melt your heart and tug at your heartstrings. She is in search of her Valentine forever to be. \n\nJaylah is a German Shorthaired Pointer Mix weighing in at #56 lbs. We estimate her to be about a year old. She was just recently spayed, current on basic vaccines as well has having flea/tick preventative. She also has had standard worming. \n\nNow that Jay Jay has started to come out of her shell and started to trust us at the shelter she has such personality. She loves to go for walks, play with her fuzzy unicorn.  She runs up and down the hall chasing it while playing fetch.  We are teaching her basic commands. She gets so excited she likes to jump up on people (not harshly) but she is learning that its good to keep all four paws on the floor.  She seems to enjoy the company of dogs her size but doesn't seem to care for anything smaller then she is. She walks well on a leash and has great kennel housetraining manners. Kitties she very focal on and wants to give chase too.  Kids, she hasn't been introduced to as of yet but we think children 8 years and older would be great for her.  Not because she is mean but she has a lot of energy and might bump a toddler down. This girl would make a great family dog who really enjoys the outdoors walking, hiking, or even cuddle time on the couch.  She just looks for anyone to give her attention. She has the sweetest soulful eyes that just makes our hearts leap. Please consider this girl. You wont be sorry. \n\nIf you think you have the right home for this girl please fill out a dog adoption application and send it back to us. You can give us a call if you need help with answering any of your questions you may have. You will need to set up a time for a meet and greet. (607-739-3945)\n\nhttp://www.horseheadscommunityanimalshelter.com\n\nPs. Pictures don't do her justice. She is a busy body and just loves to explore everything.",

This sweet and very affectionate boy was given up by his family who could longer care for him.  Titan is an active, playful and very loving dog who will instantly steal your heart at first meeting.   Being a big strong boy at 80 pounds,  we would not recommend small children, he does not realize his size and would love to be a lap dog!  Titan loves attention and will quickly get attached to a new family and person.  He will definitely need to spend most of his time in a cool air conditioned home and must have a fenced yard for playtime.  Titan has a wonderful personality and will be a great addition to a loving family or person.  He will be an amazing loyal companion and best friend.\nTitan has been neutered, is up to date on vaccinations, tested negative for heartworms and is on monthly prevention.  He will be microchipped prior to adoption.\nFor information on our adoption process and to complete an application, please visit allaboutdogscr.com or contact us by email at allaboutdogscr@gmail.com",

Lil Man is a tiny, delicate Chihuahua around 4-years-old and he is used to living with other dogs and cats. This little guy is scared of strangers and it can take him a day to warm up to new people. Once he trusts you, then he wants to be held and to be by your side, and is as sweet and loving as can be. He is good with other dogs and cats. He is not fully house-trained and may never be. He's looking for a Chihuahua-lover to appreciate all his quirks! \n\nIf interested in meeting Lil' Man, please fill out an application on-line at www.puppyhillfarm.com and we will contact you for an appointment.",

For an application please visit the RAWL website at www.rawldogs.org.  If you have questions about Preston or the adoption process please email inforawldogs@gmail.com or by calling RAWL from 7:30 until 1:00 (except Wed. & Sun)\n\n\nPreston came to RAWL as a stray with a tracking collar. His owner opted not to reclaim him. He is all about being a puppy and would do well with someone willing to invest the time he needs for more training. He is housebroken, great on a leash and knows sit and paw. He is high energy with other dogs but will respect dominant dogs whom we've paired him with at RAWL to teach him manners. Preston went to a home with children on a trial and it was a huge fail. He is not able to comprehend on his own that  food and toys that are being held by the kids do not belong to him. For this reason no kids under 12.  \n\nThe great about Preston is he has a really good heart and tries. He just needs some direction in his life, which he is receiving at RAWL.  He cannot go to a home that expects him to learn on his own.  Obviously, a fence is required. He's a hound and wants to do what hounds do...use their noses.",

            "description": "New girl on the block.  Cheach, a senior Chihuahua.  She is in foster care right now and we have asked her foster mom to write up a short bio on her.  Here it is.\nCheach recently came into rescue when her elderly mom could no longer take care of her. She was quite stressed so it took her a few days to settle in.  She\u2019s a very sweet 13 year old Chihuahua. I\u2019m beginning to see her personality come out as she feels more at home. \nShe seems to be pretty alert and healthy but she is overweight and needs to be on a good diet, but not too much! She\u2019s missing many teeth and when she has her dental cleaning, she will probably lose a few more. Which is probably why so far, she won\u2019t eat hard dry kibble. She is now eating well, Pure Vita, kibble soaked to soften, and mixed with canned food.  She is quiet and calm. She loves being outside and roams the yard until I call her in. She comes when she\u2019s called, She is shy but will let me pet her slowly and carefully. That may be because I\u2019m a new human for her. She gets along with the other dogs and has not chased the cat. Every time I let her outside she quickly does her business and has had no accidents in the house. She follows me wherever I go, even to the bathroom!.  What more could a family ask for!!\nI think she will make someone a great companion. \nIf you are interested in Cheach, please contact salemdogs@aol.com  and tell us about yourself, family, home, yard, fence, other pets, work situation, vet reference, etc.  We want to make a great match.  Please share this post and help us get this little critter into her new home.",

            "description": "Friends for life, Bear and Pippin are two tiny precious Chihuahuas that need to be adopted as a pair.  They are rarely apart and provide each other immeasurable comfort and companionship.  Both would be wonderful pets for a senior or family with older children.  No small children or puppies, please.  They prefer a calm quiet household where they can take a nap in peace.  Preferably, with someone that is home most of the day.  They like to follow you around the house as you go about your day.  Bear is a feisty five year old boy with a chocolate and white colored coat.  He may only weigh six pounds, but he\u2019s definitely the boss and has a big personality.  His shy girlfriend Pippin is seven years old and a bit on the chunky side at eight pounds.  She\u2019s a tricolored beauty and very calm and sweet.  With daily walks, Pippin should be fit and trim in no time.  Both dogs walk well on leash and enjoy taking trips to the park.  Like most Chihuahuas, they can be selective when making friends with other dogs.  If own a dog currently, we would be happy to schedule a meet and greet to check compatibility.  They are not fond of cats.  The perfect house guests, Bear and Pippin are very well mannered and already housebroken.  A fenced in yard is a must for these two tiny pups to keep them safe when outside.  Bear and Pippin are easy to love and care for.  If you are looking for a package deal, please consider this sweet pair.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

Petero is just 7 years young and enjoys neighborhood walks, taking in all the sights and of course the smells. He has beautiful soft, long fur. He can be selective with his doggie friends, and with older children. Petero needs a home with no cats. Petero is just the right size at 50 pounds, not too big and not too small. He is a very sweet boy with a playful side. He loves to be right next to his people while he naps. \n\nIf you would like to meet Petero, please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com.",

If you have a specific question that is not covered in the profile, please send us a message. \n\nNicholas is a wonderful and fun young dog. He is about 2 years old and weighs about 12lbs. He would do best in a home without small children. He is house-trained and doing well with leash walking. He loves other dogs! Nicholas is a super snuggler once he gets to know you, but he is a little nervous initially. He has lots of young dog energy and is a master at playing fetch! Nicholas is a typical terrier who likes to bark and protect his people. Nicholas would love a home with someone who understands his  nervousness and who will work with him to be the best little dog he can be!\n\nNicholas has been fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Nicholas, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: http://wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names.

He's also house trained, but still needs to go out about every 5-6 hours. His foster mom is currently working on crate training! Prince is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped; he's incredibly well mannered at vet appointments and when getting his nails trimmed! Prince was rescued from the streets after being dumped, and we enrolled him into our foster care program to prevent surrender to animal control. If you're looking for a smart and playful pup, please apply today. This is one fun-loving puppy!",

The application can be found on the RAWL website www.rawldogs.org\n\nQuestions can be emailed to inforawldogs@gmail.com or by calling 540-937-3336 during the hours of 7:30 to 1:00.\n\n\nZeus 4 year old neutered male Shepherd possibly with Rottweiler.\n\nBackground: Zeus was transferred from one of our shelter partners. He was surrendered by his owner due to the new chaining dog law's in Virginia . Zeus lived his life on a chain. And despite  that he is an incredibility sweet dog that wants to please. He was a professional puller on the leash but took right to obedience and is now subtle and steady on the leash at a heel he will also sit and down.  He will only be placed in a home with a fenced yard where he can enjoy the freedom off leash. He can display some prey drive with moving objects such as cars. But can also be easily redirected to heel.  Zeus enjoys walks, playing ball and sunning himself.  He seems to be housebroken and has never had an accident in his run. (our dogs are let out from potty breaks and play from 6 am until 1pm and 6:30 pm until 10:00 pm )  Zeus shows too much interest in moving cats a home without them is best. He loves to meet other dogs but due to his former life can be a tad rude and some dogs are offended by his fast \"hello\". A home with a confident female dog would work well.\n\n",

She\u2019s very friendly and loves to receive pets and belly rubs from friends and strangers alike! \n\nAnnie is successfully housetrained, but she does have some escape artist tendencies, so you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on her when outdoors!

            "description": "If you were to look up the definition of fun in the dictionary, Arlene's picture would be right there beside it! While some dogs take time to warm up to the hustle and bustle of the farm, Arlene seems to live for it! She has had a ball running around the fields and making new canine and human friends. She loves to play a game of chase and wrestle with her pals, but when a volunteer calls she comes running, eager to give and receive all the love! Arlene would do best in a home with older or no children as sometimes her excitement gets the best of our 60 lbs girl and she jumps and mouths to play. Like any teenager, at only 1-2 years old with likely no formal training all she needs is just a bit of guidance and structure to learn those aren't proper manners for a lady like herself. Arlene would love to find an active home, maybe even with a canine pal to be a furever playmate! Her fun-loving personality will be sure to enhance the life of the lucky home that decides to call her their own!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "In Foster\nMeet Tulip\n\nTulip became a Royal dog when she arrived from a rural area animal control that did no vetting. When she arrived we were pretty sure she was expecting. She had 2 beautiful babies and has done amazing in her foster home. Here is what her foster has to say about her.\n\nHi! My name is Tulip and I'm looking for my perfect family! I am told I'm one of the sweetest, kindest, lovable and patient dogs that anyone has ever met! I enjoy being outside, ESPECIALLY for walks or hikes, being in the leaves is my ultimate happy place! My foster family thinks I'd make a great hunting companion because I have excellent hearing and I'm very still when I hear something. I love cuddles and lounging on warm cozy blankets. I also LOVE kids and people in general. I'm very laid back and I just go with the flow. I'm not territorial over my food or my puppies. I'm housebroken but need some help with basic commands and not pulling on a leash, I am strong! I am not a huge fan of car rides, but if I can sit on your lap, I'm fine! For all that I've been through I think I'm a really good girl and so does my foster family! I'm also a huge favorite at RAR! Interested in meeting Tulip?\n\nApply at\n\nRoyalanimalrefuge.org/adopt",

Please apply online.\nYogi is 4.5 yrs old, and weighs 16 lbs. \nBear is 12.5 yrs old and weighs 60 lbs.\nAdoption Coordinator:  LK\n\nNo, it\u2019s not a mistake.  Bear, the Golden Mix and Yogi, the Chi mix, are a bonded pair so if you couldn\u2019t decide between adopting a Chihuahua or a Golden Retriever, here is your chance to have both.  Yogi is 5 years old and weighs 16 pounds.  Yogi has medium energy and is a little unsure of himself but as long as he has Bear by his side, he is braver.  He is learning that being picked up and cuddled by people is what people do with little pups.  He allows himself to be handled but always seems surprised.  Yogi loves bouncy balls because Bear loves bouncy balls and Yogi loves Bear.  They are good around other dogs and children but have not been around cats so a cat free home would be best.  Bear love to snuggle in big, soft, fluffy beds and Yogi loves using Bear as his big fluffy bed. They are crate trained and should be crated together as Yogi needs Bear to be his pillow.  It is also Yogi\u2019s job to keep Bear clean and will groom him like a cat.  Yogi has a stiff leg but that doesn\u2019t stop him from anything.  Yogi and Bear are a bonded pair and must be adopted together.  The adoption fee for the pair is $500. \n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

I'm not aggressive but very scared and would do best in an adult-only home. I can be fearful of men, so I would do better with a female caretaker that can work with me. I need to be on leashed walks only for a while. I do love other dogs, and they really help me with my confidence, so I would need to live in a home with another dog that can help show me the ropes (it is REQUIRED that I go to a home with another dog). I would do best in a home with a single woman that has another calm dog. I am quite adorable and like to play with toys once I get comfortable. Thanks to my generous benefactor, Van Messer, my adoption fee is WAIVED!",

Loves to play and she will need plenty of chew toys available.\n\nShe does great with other dogs of all sizes.  Dolly loves to be where her people are and is a big lap dog.  She does well in a kennel at night at when left home alone.  \n\nShe is also housebroken. We feel that Dolly would do best in an active home, or with another very playful dog, as she has quite a bit of energy to burn. She would do best in a home with a yard.  \n\nShe has been introduced to cats but gets fixated on them, so would probably do best in a cat free home; or will require professional training to learn to leave them alone.\n\nDolly cannot be free fed, as she will likely overeat.\n\nWith lots of love and a little training, Dolly is going to be one fantastic dog!",

            "description": "Meet Sasha!  Sasha came to us (her foster family) about 5 months ago.  We do not know a lot about her past except she was definitely neglected and abused.  She and another dog were dumped at a small rural southern shelter; her companion was in such bad shape that she was immediately euthanized. When Sasha first came to our foster home in MN, she was terrified of practically everything and she found her safe place under a bed and refused to come out.  Her behavior was similar to what puppy mill dogs are like. It took about 3-4 weeks of the foster crawling under the bed with a leash to get her to go outside to the bathroom.  The foster had to feed Sasha under the bed as well and mix her food with a lot of water to make sure she stayed hydrated.  We are happy to say a lot of these behaviors have improved.\n\nThroughout the last few months, Sasha has had a lot of ups and downs. The longer she has been with her foster she continues to have more ups.  She still spends the majority of her time under a bed (she now goes between 2 beds).  However, she now goes outside when the foster calls her name and runs outside with the rest of the dogs.  She eats without issues and has discovered a love of pizza and meaty treats.  She actually comes and stands in the hallway waiting to have treats rolled towards her.  She has braved the top of the bed quite a few times and at night will sleep on the floor next to the bed instead of under it. The times she has come up on the bed, she enjoys having the top of her head scratched and her belly rubbed.\n\nSasha is a beautiful 4-5 yr old Great Pyrenees / Australian Shepherd mix who weighs about 70 pounds.  She has white fur that is slightly coarse with spots of gray and caramel that are super soft.  She does fine with being brushed.  She has one quirky ear that stands up and one ear that folds over all the time.  She has this look of expectation that makes you want to hop up and give her a treat!  She is totally housetrained and has never had an accident in the house.  She is well behaved and has never been crated as there hasn't been a need to. She loves to go on walks and does not pull at all.  Started out on shorter walks with her and she does better than all of the foster's past foster dogs!  Underneath all Sasha's anxiety and fear is a sweet, gentle dog who will, over time, make someone a loving companion.\n \nSasha was recently accepted into a scholarship program for shy/fearful dogs. This consists of  having the opportunity to work virtually with a trainer and a veterinarian who specialize in dogs with fear and anxiety and also able to prescribe medications when necessary. Training will focus on positive reinforcement. \nThe scholarship is for a certain number of sessions and she has a lot left \u2013 it doesn\u2019t end on a certain date. This opportunity of support will continue into her new home to her new adopter, free of charge.\n\nWe have decided to try and find her forever home now for a few reasons.  The main reason is because we don\u2019t want her to continue to have major improvements with her current foster only to have a huge setback when she is adopted.  Her improvements are coming quicker now so we think it would be a good time for her to find her new home.  \n\nShe also does not get along with one of our resident dogs.  We are not sure why it is only this dog as she ignores the other two, but we are concerned this could set her back some steps.  She has also become occasionally territorial of her space under one of the beds so we feel a change would benefit her. \n\nWe believe Sasha will do best as an only dog in a quiet adult home with a very secure fenced yard so she has the option of relaxing outside for short periods of time on nice days \u2013 she would not do well on a tie-out.  Her new family should have experience with shy/fearful dogs and will need to be patient and understanding of her fears and anxiety and want to continue to work with her. She does have a lot of potential but it will take time.  She has started taking some anti-anxiety medications that she may or may not need long term.  \n\nSasha is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and tested heartworm negative. Her microchip is registered to Second Chance. Before coming into our program, she had entropion surgery but, unfortunately, a little too much of her eyelid was removed - enough remains to cover the eye when she closes the lids so no artificial lubrication is needed.  If you have any question or would like to meet Sasha, call 651-771-5662. \n",

            "description": "Gorgeous George is an adorable 10 week old Golden/Shar Pei/Pit puppy.  He is currently 12 pounds and is an extremely loving, mellow puppy.  He loves playing with his dog housemates and gets along with all dogs he meets but has not been around cats.  He sleeps through the night in his crate and is working on his potty training.  He is super smart and picks up new training quickly.  \n\nGeorge also enjoys sitting on your lap and getting delicious rubs where he eventually falls asleep.  His foster family takes him in the car for school pick ups etc., and he loves the car and is very comfortable going to new stores and homes.\n\nThis guy will easily become the center of your world! He is intelligent, eager to please and a quick learner.  If you are looking for a sweet, fun, gorgeous puppy, George is the one!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Hound lover, rejoice! \n\nThis handsome, hunky hound is Quentyn. At 6 years old, this sweet, active, goofy guy has his sights set on a forever home. The kind of forever home where he can play the day away, curl up at a night, snuggle, and get loved on. Do you happen to be looking for a handsome hound? If so, read on!\n\nQuentyn or \"\"Q\"\" as his foster Mom calls him was found running loose by a good samaritan. This poor guy was dirty, skinny, and shy when he was first found. It was clear he had been through a lot. However, with some tender loving care, this guy has not only put on weight but has also come way out of his shell. He is now an outgoing, playful guy. Quentyn needs an active family. One who likes long walks or playtime in the backyard. He would love, love, love a canine playmate, though it is not a requirement for his forever home. He loves other dogs, big and small! Any canine playmates should be active, too. Quentyn is currently fostering in New England with his foster Mom, human foster brother, and 2 canine foster siblings. He does great with his 7-year-old foster brother. He is very gentle and snuggly with him.\n\nQuentyn's foster Mom describes him as \"\"goofy and clumsy.\"\" He's one of those guys who doesn't have a sense of how big he is. AKA he's a 60 pound lap dog. He will climb over everything to perch himself right in his foster Mom's lap. At 60 pounds, this is no small feat! He is also described as a snuggle bug. When not playing, he wants all the love. He is also still working on mastering the dos and don't of indoor living. We are thinking he has never really lived in a home. When he first arrived, counters were free reign. So were all the other surfaces in the home. He has made great strides in learning his indoor manners but he will need continued work on this. He promises with time, patience, and cookies (this is a very important one), he will figure out the indoor rules.\n\nQuentyn has been hard at work in his foster home working on potty training and crate training. He has just about mastered potty training. His foster Mom works from home so he is let out every 1-3 hours. With this routine, he is doing well. He will need a family who can carry on potty training. He whines and complains when he first goes into the crate. After some time, he settles in. He sleeps in the crate all night with no problem. \n\nApply today to learn more about this hunky hound! Like, seriously, is he not a dream boat?!\n\n\nName: Quentyn\nBreed: Hound mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 6 years old\nWeight: 59 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative \nMicrochipped: Yes\nMedical: Quentyn did have a malignent mass (mast cell tumor) that was removed when he was neutered. There is a chance that this mass could regrow. Currently there are no signs of regrowth or spread.\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Unknown\nGood with Dogs: Yes- so far seems to be good with other dogs, mostly has interacted with dogs smaller than him.\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "Please, meet Zara.  She is a mix of Belgian shepherd dog, weight approximately 45 pounds, age 5-6 years.  Zara was rescued with newborn puppies from the industrial zone of the Moscow Region, Russia.  In December 2019, volunteers found her and took the emaciated and frozen Zara along with her were newborn puppies to a veterinary clinic that provides excellent care for rescue dogs.  The puppies were very weak and to the great grief all working to save them, the 8 puppies died.  But we managed to save Zara's life.  She is a very human-oriented dog of incredible kindness and affection who gets along well with other dogs, is neutral to cats, and good with children.  Zara walks easily on a leash, is microchipped, vaccinated, and healthy in relation to age.  Because she was a homeless street dog for some time, Zara\u2019s teeth are worn, but our team obtained a dental examination where all diseased teeth were removed and all the rest were cleaned; her teeth and gums are now in excellent condition.  Let's help our \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d find the best home and family!  The most loyal and best friends are those who have lived a hard life; they will appreciate and thank you for the rest of their days.  Don't be afraid to save; by saving those in need you are saving your soul.  God bless you!\n Regards Dire Straits Paws?",

Please apply online.\nYogi is 4.5 yrs old, and weighs 16 lbs. \nBear is 12.5 yrs old and weighs 60 lbs.\nAdoption Coordinator:  LK\n \n\nNo, it\u2019s not a mistake.  Bear, the Golden Mix and Yogi, the Chi mix, are a bonded pair so if you couldn\u2019t decide between adopting a Chihuahua or a Golden Retriever, here is your chance to have both.  Bear is a wonderful \u201cyoung man\u201d.  He is 12 years young and weighs 60 pounds.  Bear has low energy and like a typical Retriever he loves bouncy balls and Yogi loves Bear so he also loves bouncy balls as well.  They are good around other dogs and children but have not been around cats so a cat free home would be best.  They both love to snuggle in big, soft, fluffy beds.  They are crate trained and should be crated together as Yogi needs Bear to be his pillow.  It is also Yogi\u2019s job to keep Bear clean and will groom him like a cat.  Bear is a low maintenance, sweet, sweet boy.  He and Yogi are a bonded pair and must be adopted together. The adoption fee for the pair is $500.\n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

            "description": "Fellow animal lovers, \nAllow us to introduce Logan. Logan is a ~1 yr old, neutered, male, German Shepherd / Rottie mix. Like many large dogs Logan's age, he looks like an adult, but is actually just a young lad - albeit a big one. PACC is supporting Logan's family, who have come to the difficult conclusion that they cannot provide Logan what he needs to be *his best self*. Simply put, Logan needs a more active home than the family can provide. A long walk (or run), a few tosses of the tennis ball and mental stimulation for those \"smarter than the average bear's\" and Logan will reach, and likely overtake, that *Good Boy* status. Adopters will benefit from the work Logan's family has put into his foundational skills. He is non-reactive to dogs on leash, relatively chill on even an overly busy coastal trail, good with kids, people (slightly more wary of men than women, but quickly warms up) and loves to PLAY. Can you say tennis ball?! Cause Logan can chase and return a tennis ball until the cows come home. He's also a big fan of the hose because it has, well...water!\n\nIf Logan sounds like a good fit with your family (great in a single or multiple dog household) please complete the PACC Adoption Application at the link below and we will reach out to you. Logan has not been kitty tested yet, but we can report back on that front if needed.\n\nPACC Adoption Application: \n\nhttps://forms.gle/rZZ7R7kiXV9wpkGH6\n\nContacts:\nKit O'Doherty, kitodoherty@gmail.com, (650) 274-5236 c\nChris Guio, cguio1@yahoo.com, (650) 438-0617 c\n\nhttps://www.partnersinanimalcare.com/adopt\n",

He is brand new to us so we are still getting to know him. He currently weighs 110 pounds and is said to be a retired service dog of some kind. He seems to be an easy going guy who kind of just rolls with the punches, so to speak. He has had basic training and is well mannered. He is incredibly strong and does need a little work on leash walking. Meatball will need to be neutered and his fee is $200.\n\nBREED EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: Meatball is looking for an adopter who does have experience with Cane Corsos or similar breeds. He is not a dog for a first time dog owner. His former owner did say that he is NOT good with other dogs, which is known to typical of the breed. However, he has done well with cats and kids.\n\nNOTE: We are closed to the public but are doing adoptions via private appointment once an application has been completed and approved. Applications can be submitted at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

She does best with gentle training and already knows her basic obedience. She is very person oriented and in search of a forever family to call her own. Could it be yours?\n\nJayden needs a home with an experienced owner. Her keen mind needs stimulation and training. She will need a fenced yard as this girl likes her playtime. Jayden would do well with another nice dog for companionship.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300.00 and includes veterinary check-up, de-worming, microchip, vaccinations, flea treatment and spay. Jayden is heart worm negative and up to date on her shots.\n\nCurrently Jayden lives in Rutherford County, NC.\n\nTo adopt please go to the following link and fill out an application:\nhttps://www.leeshorerescue.com/apply.html\n\nPKP",

Everybody loves a Lab, but they think Staffordshires aren't nice, and they confuse us with Pit Bulls (who can also be very nice). I'm a good boy! I'm cute, too! I am 1 1/2 years old and weigh about 60 pounds, all of which are filled with love. But my love may lead me to be too protective of you, so you will have to have a trainer to show me my mistake. Since I need to be the only dog in the house, that shouldn't be too hard for you. I love to walk, but I don't like collars. I pull on the leash partly due to that, and partly because I'm anxious to see other people and say Hi! I'm a real cuddler, but I need someone with dog experience to remind me who the boss is in case I'm cuddling too much, although I never heard of such a thing as cuddling too much, have you?? Have you been looking for me? Here I am! Right under your nose! (posted 9/4/20, HS) (revision 1/24/21)\n**It is rare that we know with certainty the ages or mixes that make up our dogs, but we do our best to be as accurate as possible based upon our experience.\nAdoption: $225.00The total fee for Remi, which includes adoption and transport, is only $225.00. This is not because there is anything wrong with him; we just want him in your home as soon as possible. 2/2/21 5:21 PM",

This unbelievably cute puppy arrived at the shelter as a VERY scared stray pup and is currently in a foster home where he is flourishing! He LOVES to play with other dogs (cats unknown) and just wants to snuggle and make his humans happy. He's currently 25 lbs and growing! We expect that he will be close to 50 lbs full grown. He is working on basic obedience and manners and will make a dedicated, loving companion for a lucky family. If you would like more information about this foster pet, please contact the Foster Care Coordinator at fosterpets@talgov.com and reference the Animal ID Number at the beginning of this post.",

            "description": "Kiev is the sweetest boy! He is a 10 week old, 12lb Black Lab mix puppy that is curious about everything and has a very sweet disposition. We expect he will be 50-65 lbs when fully grown.  Above all, he loves to be with people and wants to be where he has a human to hang out with.  He\u2019s happy to play, happy to nap, happy to snuggle and is a great companion for those of us working from home and looking for someone to nap at our feet!  He is great with kids of all ages, is very cute with other dogs (he just wants to lick them), has potty training almost mastered, and sleeps through the night!  He would be a great fit for most anyone who is able to keep him company during the day and is home or can take him with them - he will happily hop in the car too or go for long walks but just likes human companionship!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

Imogene is timid, playful and sweet.  She is a bit nervous when first meeting new people but once she warms up is a goofy happy girl.  Imogene is great with dogs and would benefit from living with a playful confident canine.  She is good with cats.  Imogene is in a foster home with three children and seems to do well with them.  She can be timid of chaos though so would need to be monitored when kids have friends over.  Imogene would do well with a fenced yard as she initially tried to get out of the door when people came in and out.  Once she is comfortable in a situation she is good off leash and likes to hike.  Imogene is house trained and should be crated when left home alone.  She enjoys chewing electronics...  like the remote control.  \n\nAdoption fee: $300\nBirthday: 4/1/2020\nWeight: 50 lbs.",

Great Pyrenees/St. Bernard Mix.  Her sweet and sensitive eyes are quickly charming her foster family!  Penny is inquisitive, loveable, fluffy, and calm.  Penny loves other dogs and children, but can be shy when meeting adults.  She currently lives in a foster home with 2 other dogs and is learning quickly from her canine companions.  She is house-trained, but because of her timid demeanor, she is still working on her leash skills.  \n\nPenny is eager to please and loves to cuddle.  Due to her size, Penny will need a home with ample space for a large dog- because she still has some growing to do! At times she forgets her size, but has been nothing but gentle and sweet with the children in her foster home.   Penny will make a wonderful family dog! \n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

Thank you! \n****************\nIntroducing... Bobby! ?  This sweet boy came to us from Missouri in hopes of finding his perfect FOREVER home.  \n\nBobby (we've been calling him Bobby McGee because we love that song!) is a wonderful boy.  He was in a loving home with multiple other animals and at some point, there was a fight between him and a new dog brought into the home.  The family decided that Bobby would do better being rehomed than the new dog that had suffered abuse.  The rescue we received him from said that Bobby DID get along with male and female dogs, and that they tested him and he was even willing to share his food with a little Chihuahua.  Of course, a \"meet and greet\" would be required with any other dogs in a potential adopter's home.  We were also told that Bobby previously lived in a home with children present.  As he is new to DMCHS, we are currently unsure of how Bobby does with cats. \n\nBobby is just 3 years old.  He is a 55-60lb pit mix (we also see lab and/or shepherd) in this gorgeous dog.  He is ridiculously sweet, loves attention, loves to play with toys, takes treats gently, and seems to know basic commands.... and he gives the best doggy kisses, ever.   Bobby does have skin allergies and a potential adopter would need to feed Bobby a good quality skin sensitivity food.  There is mention of a bit of separation anxiety so a family that is home a lot would be ideal for this gorgeous dog.  We are so excited to find a family for Bobby.....  This awesome boy is going to make a great family member for his new family!  ?\n\nInterested? Please call us Tues-Fri from 3-6pm and from 1-5pm on the weekends.  319.753.8389.  Please remember that all visits to our shelter are currently by appointment only.  Thank you!\n\n\nAll dog adoptions include the spay/neuter, heartworm test, first two sets of basic immunizations as well as a rabies vaccine and a vet visit. Our adoption fee is $125.00 and all dogs do require an approved application. \n\n",

            "description": "Wilbur is a sweet large mixed breed dog that appears to be a labrador retriever. His estimated birthdate is 01/20/2014. He came to the Mission after spending 11 months in a local shelter and being overlooked for fear and kennel reactivity. \n\nAlthough we have only had him a short time, he has proven to be a normal and happy dog outside of the shelter setting. He is still on the fearful end of the spectrum and will take time to settle in with a new family. He appears to be potty trained and is also fine being crated for a full work day if needed. He also has excellent leash manners. \n\nWilbur is good with other dogs and also seems tolerant of cats. Although he wouldn't be mean to children, his happiest life would likely be in a childless home because he prefers a quiet lifestyle without a ton of activity and unnecessary noise. He is currently extremely overweight and anyone interested in adopting him must be willing to adhere to his diet plan to help him get to a healthy pet to fit weight. We do not tolerate obesity in Mission pets as it leads to chronic pain and an overall lack of life quality and a decreased lifespan, so shedding those pounds will be paramount to his best future. \n\nWilbur comes neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and dewormed, plus he will have a fresh dental cleaning. His adoption fee will be $200.00. To be considered to adopt, please visit www.murcismission.org and send in an application.",

Cookie would prefer to bond to her human, and Diamond is content in a comfy bed with her favorite stuffed toys. They are both house trained, and have not been crated at the fosters. They are overall good with cats, Cookie has not paid attention to the cat at the fosters house, and Diamond was curious but ignored it after a week or so. \n\nCookie has exhibited anxiety, which worsens when she is separated from Diamond. We ask that potential adopter be understanding that an adjustment period will be needed as she does get stressed with a big change.",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\n\u201cHello future cuddle mate(s),\n\nDo you hear my lovely southern accent?  If you do not, foster mom rarely hears it since I rarely bark which makes her neighbors happy at her condo. It is hard to believe that I am a southern girl when I love playing in the snow. The ice, not so much.  \n\nWhen I want to go outside, I will run to the door and back to you. I only had an accident when I got overly stimulated and forgot my manners. I do also enjoy a few walks each day.  \n\nI hate crates and have broken out twice. Foster mom has started leaving me in her bedroom when she goes to work. I just sleep there until she comes home.\n\nI love meeting new people and dogs. My eyesight has started to go so I cannot handle little kids anymore playing with me and around me. It makes me nervous. I also prefer to play with my toys solo. Somebody forgot to teach me how to share.  \n\nI am an excellent, 16-pound cuddler, and love being pet and scratched behind the ears. I do not like being picked up and held. It does not matter if you were gone all day or gone five minutes, I will always greet you with wagging tail and jump up and down with my front legs in excitement. My human(s) are my world.  \n\nBeing an older lady (10 years old), I do have a couple things going on. I have a little bit of fur loss, and a couple bumps that the vet is looking into. Foster mom will tell you more.  \n\nI would love to find a quiet household with human(s) who love to cuddle and will help me learn to share my toys. If you are ready for lots of love, please apply to learn more about me.\n\nQueen Vivian\"\n\n\nHer adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

They are house trained and walk nicely on a leash. They are nervous at first around new people and new situations so a home without children would be best. We are hoping to find them a home together but we know that is a tall order!\n\nThere is a waived adoption fee for the right home and you can email us at adopt@situateanimalshelter.org if you think you might be interested in fostering or adopting them together or separately.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Cash! My new friends at BAGSR say that my adopters will hit the jackpot with me. I am about 6 years old and have a beautiful, shinny black coat. Thankfully BAGSR grabbed me out of the shelter and found me a safe and loving foster home while they help me find a new family.  I'm a little underweight and should weigh about 80 pounds.  I have a healthy appetite though and will get there in no time. \n\nI've gotten quite used to indoor living and have even already learned how to use the dog door to go outside when I need to. My foster mom thinks I\u2019m a pretty smart boy. I'm learning my basics here at my foster home and am a quick study. It would be great if my new family will take me to dog school to continue my learning. I'm sure I would love that.\n\nI don\u2019t love using a crate but sometimes I find treats in there so I may learn to like it!\n\nI don\u2019t need a ton of exercise but really enjoy leash walks. I\u2019m quite polite on leash and I pass other dogs without issue. I just like to watch them go by.\n\nI'm doing great with my foster dog siblings. With a dog/cat savvy owner who helps me, I may get along with a cat. I haven't been overyly interested in cats that I have met.\n\nI take treats gently too.\n\nI really enjoy affection as my foster mom is loving on me all of the time! I even make a little purring sound when I'm snuggling. I'm a vocal boy and like to moan and groan or let out a small bark when I want something.  I can be a little mouthy and do this little nibbly thing. My foster mom says that\u2019s my way of showing affection. I didn't have much lovin' in my previous life but I do now and I will surely bond closely with my new people.\n\nI'm very polite in the car and love to go. When my foster mom leaves me to run into a store or something, sometimes I bark once but then just wait patiently for her to come back. I am very attached to her and will bond closely with my new people.\n\nI learned quickly what is expected of me in the house and have wonderful house manners. I can wait patiently at home with my foster dog siblings if my foster mom goes out and I also sleep quietly on my dog bed all through the night. \n\nI am still learning about toys and I find my hedgehog with a Christmas hat kind of fun to play with!\n\nI\u2019ll be waiting in Granite Bay. Hope to meet you!\n\nhttps://www.bayareagsr.org/available-dogs/1478-cash\n\nIF YOU ARE interested in CASH, Please go to the webpage above and contact us directly using the forms there.\n\n\nFind us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/Bay-Area-German-Shepherd-Rescue-184324951742737/\n\nFollow us on Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/bayarea.gsr/\n\nBay Area German Shepherd Rescue normally has 20 dogs all over the Bay Area.

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Rascal! Here is his video in NC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eYDEfaOW-Nk\n\nRascal is 2 years old (approx. DOB 1-8-20 tbd), male, 46 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Rascal arrived at the shelter with odd injuries on his right legs seemingly bite wounds (since healed). He is good with other dogs!\n\nAge: 2 Years\n\nGood with Dogs? Yes seems fine\n\nGood with Cats? Might be ok\n\nHas a prey drive? None seen\n\nGood with smaller kids (mouthy, nippy, jumpy, chase, scared)? Not scared at kennel, might be ok\n\nEnergy Level (low, low-medium, medium, medium-high, or high)? Medium\n\nScared of people or socially outgoing? Outgoing at kennel\n\nNeeds another dog in the home (if scared of people), ok as only, or either way? Either way\n\nCrate trained? Yes\n\nDoes he/she like the crate? yes\n\nPotty trained? Yes\n\nChewer/destructive? No\n\nSeparation Anxiety from people when left alone? No\n\nVocal? No\n\nBehavior on leash when walking near lots of people/dogs? Good\n\nConcerning behavior: None\n\nBest in the busy City or rural calm or doesn't matter? Either way\n\nCheck/keep eye on puncture wounds (inside right front leg wrist & same leg under arm pit) doing great !\n\nStay tuned for more information as Rascal is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rascal please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

She is shy to begin with but then opens up. Baby Girl is good with other dogs; cats are unknown. She is a love bug and is happy snuggling with you.

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Ollie (fka Sausage lol)! Here is his video in NC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xm4ioYKNYZk\n\nOllie is 2 years old (approx. DOB 10-21-18), male, 65 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Ollie know Sit, loves his food (great for training), loves to play, and can catch treats in the air! Ollie was surrendered to the shelter by his family dirty and smelling of smoke just 3 days after Christmas. Their reason for abandoning this boy referenced one resource guarding incident with food that had dropped on the floor in October. Why did they wait over 2 months? The shelter staff documented that they tested him for resource guarding and he was non-reactive. We never know the truth behind the \"stories\" of dogs being abandoned. The shelter said they had zero issues while he was in the shelter nor has he had any challenges while in daycare boarding awaiting his ride to Vermont. Ollie met another female unaltered large dog and greeted her with happy tail wags and relaxed body language; he assessed well with other dogs. He is a polite and handsome boy! Ollie's ideal home would be active, have experience, and older kids. Stay tuned for more information as Ollie is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ollie please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

My coat will need good care - like lots of brushing to keep it silky and mat-free. I really enjoy being brushed!\n\nI am looking for a family who can spend time with me doing the fun things that we youngsters so enjoy. I'll need an active family as I need regular physical and mental exercise to keep me healthy. I would love to continue my training as I'm super smart but I really need you to be a leader and make sure I do everything right. If you don't tell me I will try to figure it out myself and I don't always get it right. I love long walks, hikes, road trips and time at the beach. I really enjoy water! Exercise and the outdoors are really fun for me. I'm also treat motivated and take treats gently. When I'm really excited, I can be a little too mouthy and will need to be reminded to keep it soft. I just can't help myself sometimes but I'm working on it. \n\nDid I mention I love car rides. Oh boy, I love getting in the car and going places and I am a good backseat rider. I'm not a fan of being left alone for too long as I really would prefer to be with my person. I will need a family where someone is home a lot but can help me learn to be without you. I am crate trained but it's not my favorite place to be. \n\nI'll be a super fun companion for an active adopter who has lots of time to spend with me. I get lots of attention when out and about and meet strangers well. I'm good with other dogs, too but no cats for me please. They really annoy me. I do forget my manners when on leash and will pull a little more than most people like. I've been learning to walk on a front clip harness and I'm doing pretty well. I can also walk with a head halter but prefer the front clip harness as I love to sniff my way through my walks. Maybe some fun \"hide the treats\" games would be good!!  I'm up for just about anything.....\n\nI'll be waiting in Windsor for my perfect match.\n\nhttps://www.bayareagsr.org/available-dogs/1413-thea\n\nIF YOU ARE interested in THEA, Please go to the webpage above and contact us directly using the forms there.\n\n\nFind us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/Bay-Area-German-Shepherd-Rescue-184324951742737/\n\nFollow us on Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/bayarea.gsr/\n\nBay Area German Shepherd Rescue normally has 20 dogs all over the Bay Area.

I can't understand it since I always have a smile on my face and am a LOVER. You just can't stop me from dancing or jive talking; I just want to be staying alive with a loving family! So, let me show you how deep is my love and come get me!\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:This is Barry who is probably around 2 to 3.He is very nice and friendly. Mellow too. He was found on the lam so his history is a mystery! Handsome feller too.\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals!

What this means is that he walks like a 'crab' on his hind legs - so, he definitely has a \"unique\" gait. But, this does not slow him down at all. He runs and plays and does just fine. As he gets older, he will likely develop arthritis in his rear legs sooner than a dog without this condition.\nThis being said, Beck is a very sweet, happy and lovable boy. He particularly loves women. With men, it can take him some time to warm up to them, but it really depends. In his original foster home, he was fine with his foster dad (who is 69), but Beck seems to have a trust problem with younger males.\nAs noted, Beckley adores women, and, as you can see in some of his pictures, he loves his sweaters. He actually prefers to wear outfits as not!!! He sleeps with his foster Grandmother and gets along well with the other dogs in the house (a Cattle Dog and a very large English Bulldog/Am. Staff Terrier).\nBeck is about 90% house trained, as the cold weather/snow is hard on him to go outside. However, his foster Mom does make sure he goes out on a regular basis.\nBeck is a wonderful little man who needs a person who is willing to dote on him and love him for who the sweet, affectionate little guy that he is. We believe he would do best in a household with women only, or an older couple. Please consider making this sweet boy become a cherished member of your home.\nIf you have the time, willingness and ability to provide a loving, nurturing home to Beckley for his whole life, we'd love to hear from you. To pursue Beckley's adoption, you will need to register on www.safeatlast.net. (Click Register on the left-hand side of our homepage.) When you receive your password, please log back on to our website to complete the Safe at Last online adoption application. (Click Forms/Applications on the left-hand side of our home page.) Once we have your application, if we feel your home is a good match for Beckley, we will contact you by email to schedule the phone interview to commence the review process. Our process is very straightforward but does involve the phone interview, reference checks and a home assessment. An adoption fee of $425 also applies.\nPlease be advised that you cannot meet Beckley until you have been approved to adopt. We cannot consider you until you have submitted the completed Safe at Last online adoption application. Delay in submitting your application will put you at a disadvantage to other potentially qualified applicants.\nFinally, Beckley is being fostered in the Oneonta/Morris NY area. Approved adopters are required to go to the foster home to complete the adoption. Adopters are also required to adhere to all COVID-19 safety protocols (including mask) when at the foster home.\nThank you for your interest in this sweet boy!\nNY Rescue Registry No. RR 087.",

DOB tbd), male, 75 lbs (but thinks he is 10lbs)., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Apollo was saved on New Years Eve from a very neglectful and isolating situation in Vermont. He was kept tied up in one room of a house after being abandoned by his owner in an apartment. He had sores on his legs we can only guess was a result of boredom. Apollo has missed out on so much since a puppy and a young dog! He is learning and is in process of catching up with our Trainer. Apollo is a big boy with a big bark but is a teddy bear at heart! His best home would be Intermediate Experience, active, no cats (loves to play and chase), would be strong (he is a strong boy) and he would be the only pet. Stay tuned for more information as Apollo is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Apollo please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

We match dogs with a suitable home/family - so available dogs may already have a potential match. In addition, since we are always rescuing dogs, there are often dogs not yet posted. We allow them time to settle in with their foster home in order to evaluate their health and personality.\n\nHoney is 1 1/2 yrs old and new to our rescue. More information will be posted about her once her foster family has gotten to know her. The adoption fee for Honey is $400.\nDont forget to visit our informative website, www.almosthomeohio.org, for valuable information and interesting features.",

I\u2019m a pretty big boy (70 pounds and growing) and I\u2019m still learning how to control my floppy puppy body. I fall over and run into things a lot, but my foster mom and dad think it\u2019s really cute and funny! Even though I\u2019m a big boy, I think I\u2019m the perfect size lap dog and love to lay on you, sit on you and snuggle and give you kisses non-stop.\n\nMy foster mom says I\u2019m really smart. I didn\u2019t have many rules before I came to her house, but I\u2019ve already learned sit, paw and down. I also sit and wait to eat my meals every day because I\u2019m a very polite boy!\n\nI\u2019m a PRO at potty training. I learned REALLY fast!!! I was a super nervous about my crate when I first came to live with my foster mom, but it\u2019s just because I prefer to be right next to humans instead! I\u2019m getting better with my crate every day and now sleep in my crate all through the night without crying.\n\nI live with two dogs in my foster home and I LOVE them, but I\u2019m still learning some manners, so you may need to be patient with me. I\u2019m perfectly fine being your only Buddy, but if I have a dog sibling, they need to be tolerant and willing to help me learn how to play without getting too excited.\n\nThanks for reading about me, I can\u2019t wait to meet you and see if I can be your best \u201cBuddy\u201d for life!\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me. Please visit www.pittiesandpurrs.org to fill out an application. For further information contact adoptpitties@gmail.com\n",

Adopters with German Shepard experience are preferred. At this time, Magnum will need to be the only pet in his new home.

            "description": "Annie is available for adoption to Texas residents only.\n\nAnnie is just under a year old. She has been mostly an outside dog, but since being in foster care she has done wonderfully in the house. Annie is using a doggie door to go potty and has yet to have an accident in the house. She has shown to be good with dogs of all sizes, people, and has been around children as young as 6 yrs old. We think she would do best with a doggie playmate. Annie is a little fearful of new situations but is overcoming her fears with good positive experiences. She is a very sweet and loving girl!\n\nIf you are interested in applying for Annie, please use the application link below. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zGtCUUqOvBHxQtIy7j4-qA_W-b_PIitAaDXAf8MuKHg/edit\n\n",

Please DO NOT CONTACT EAPL about courtesy listings. The pet owner/rescue/shelter and new owner shall make all arrangements on transferring the pet, information on history, vaccines, etc.\n\nName: Buddy (also answers to Butters) Age: ~10 Weight: 90 pounds\n\nColor: Brown with a few white spots Gets along with: All adults and older children (10+)\n\nContact: 720-985-7018 or AdoptSweetBuddy@gmail.com\n\nBuddy couldn't be a sweeter dog! He's older but has a lot of life left in him. He loves going on walks, running like a goof around the yard, and naps! The perfect home for Buddy is where he can nap, relax, and get pets. He needs to be the only pet in the home and any children need to be over 10. He is very friendly with everyone he meets but doesn't like kids climbing on him so he would be best in a home with older or no children. He loves sleeping in the sun and will follow it around the house throughout the day or lay outside in it when it's warm out. He LOVES a nice comfy dog bed but is just as happy to lay on blankets or a pile of laundry. Buddy is crate trained and can hang in his crate when you're away during the day or be left out, he'll just take naps the whole time. He likes stuffed toys and soft rubber ones, he is missing some teeth so he doesn't chew through them very quickly. He also loves all treats and will gladly eat medicine if you put it in some American cheese. He will follow you around the house because he loves being near people. Buddy is scared of fireworks and loud noises, creating a place for him to hide when that's happening really helps him. It's best if he gets to go outside to potty before fireworks start. He is also scared of any size vacuum and will run away from them. He is food motivated and has puppy dog eyes down! He'll eat any kind of treat and will love you for it! He's a great dog and deserves a great home!",

            "description": "All people inquiring about pets listed as Courtesy Listings on the EAPL website and/or EAPL posting adoption boards should contact the current pet owner/rescue/shelter for answers to any questions and for final approval and placement. Please DO NOT CONTACT EAPL about courtesy listings. The pet owner/rescue/shelter and new owner shall make all arrangements on transferring the pet, information on history, vaccines, etc.\n\nName: Buddy (also answers to Butters) Age: ~10 Weight: 90 pounds\n\nColor: Brown with a few white spots Gets along with: All adults and older children (10+)\n\nContact: 720-985-7018 or AdoptSweetBuddy@gmail.com\n\nBuddy couldn't be a sweeter dog! He's older but has a lot of life left in him. He loves going on walks, running like a goof around the yard, and naps! The perfect home for Buddy is where he can nap, relax, and get pets. He needs to be the only pet in the home and any children need to be over 10. He is very friendly with everyone he meets but doesn't like kids climbing on him so he would be best in a home with older or no children. He loves sleeping in the sun and will follow it around the house throughout the day or lay outside in it when it's warm out. He LOVES a nice comfy dog bed but is just as happy to lay on blankets or a pile of laundry. Buddy is crate trained and can hang in his crate when you're away during the day or be left out, he'll just take naps the whole time. He likes stuffed toys and soft rubber ones, he is missing some teeth so he doesn't chew through them very quickly. He also loves all treats and will gladly eat medicine if you put it in some American cheese. He will follow you around the house because he loves being near people. Buddy is scared of fireworks and loud noises, creating a place for him to hide when that's happening really helps him. It's best if he gets to go outside to potty before fireworks start. He is also scared of any size vacuum and will run away from them. He is food motivated and has puppy dog eyes down! He'll eat any kind of treat and will love you for it! He's a great dog and deserves a great home!",
