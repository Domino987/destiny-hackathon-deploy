            "description": "This 1 year old cutie is a good cuddler and an even better kisser. Meet Belle. She's ready to go home with you.\n\nBelle was surrendered to MCR recently, and the volunteers and staff here have loved getting to know her. So far, we've learned that Belle loves to snuggle close to her people, enjoys food as much as we do, and has an adorable playful streak. We've also noticed how she thinks the outside world is pretty terrifying -- especially when there are loud noises or sudden movements -- so she'll need more help to build confidence.\n\nBelle's previous family reports that she's good with older kids, other dogs, and cats (though she is a fan of giving big smooches to her kitty friends, which is not always well received). She was also housetrained but had started to go potty inside recently, so she'll need help re-learning that skill. \n\nIn her previous home, Belle liked to wrestle and to play fetch, and when she was left unattended, she found other ways to entertain herself, like chewing. This lovely gal will need outlets for her mental and physical energy, and since Belle, like most dogs, really loves to chew, she'll need some good and safe options for putting her chompers to work. \n\nWe think Belle would enjoy living in a home with another dog friend, particularly one who's confident and playful. And we know she'd appreciate having a human lap available to rest her head on at the end of a long, fun-filled day.\nFor more information about our adoptable dogs and/or to submit an adoption inquiry, please visit meridianrescue.org.",

            "description": "Onyx is a sweet, happy little girl. Since coming into foster, she has gotten accustomed to sleeping in a crate at night. She's also slowly learning commands including sit and touch (she is very food motivated). She's extremely gentle taking treats and is friendly toward everyone (people and dogs included). She enjoys spending her days lounging in the backyard, sunning herself to sleeping on the couch with another doggie companion. She also periodically enjoys playing with her fellow canine companion and in a couple instances, when she has gotten excited, she's even zoomed around a bit. She enjoys car rides and just about any adventure that has come her way. She is enthusiastic about taking walks and despite her physical ailment, she is able to keep up (she switches between walking and hopping along...which is very cute to see :) Overall, Onyx would be an ideal dog for a couple or family (with or without a canine companion) who enjoys easy activity/exercise.",

Each time we have learned something different about this beautiful girl. And, we will not fail her again. Shyla must be the only pet and would prefer an adult only home, although she can do well with mature children over 12 who can respect her space. She desperately needs someone who will be her leader and help her to make the right decisions. An active person or family is a bonus, she loves exercise! With time and patience, her confidence will grow again, and she will become the good girl we know she can be. Shyla is currently working with a dog trainer to jumpstart her transition into your home.Call HSCC at (814)535-6116 for more information about the adoption process.",

Unknown. \nGOOD FOR KIDS? 16+ \n \n- To learn if this pet is still available for adoption, please check their adoption profile on our Adopets site, by visiting www.ucspca.org. - \nIf they are not listed on that site, or the Adopt Me button has been deactivated, we have received multiple applications for that pet and are not accepting any more at this time.

The other dog wanted to steal Hubie's chew toy! We know this is a very manageable behavior, and with nice beagle boys they are always so easy going, so we don't see much of a concern with it. He is in foster care at Happy Bark now and he gets along well with the other dogs in the house. Typical to the breed, Hubie loves to roam around and keep his nose to the ground.

            "description": "The world famous Carter is now looking for a great new home!  Sadly, Carter didn't become famous for anything good.  Carter's owners moved away to Georgia and left him chained up in the backyard with a bloody bandage wrapped around his injured neck.  Carter spent many months under medical care receiving laser therapy on his severely infected neck and finally, he's all healed!  Carter is a little less than a year old and this poor boy has never known what it's like to be in a home.  Everything is new to him and many things scare him.  Our staff have helped him in overcoming his fears, but Carter will need an experienced and patient home where he'll get all of the direction and attention he deserves.  He's a sweet, affectionate boy that loves everyone he meets.  He's learning to love toys and he loves to run laps around our exercise yard.  Carter will need a home with no young kids or cats, but seems fine with larger dogs. He will need a fenced yard as well.  If you can offer Carter the perfect home that he's so deserving of, call 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an application and appointment.  File#29895  11/20/20 \n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

While fending for himself he was shot, which made him even more skittish. But with the help of some awesome rescue friends we were able to trap him. He\u2019s actually very sweet and after being in a foster home for just a week he is making a lot of progress! ?Gunner is a 3 to 4 year old pit/lab mix. This beautiful boy just needs and wants a lot of love!! He really likes other dogs and is starting to love people, he is just not sure about Cats yet! Since Gunner doesn\u2019t want to be noticed we disguised him as a sloth!!?????\nGunner is currently undergoing fast kill heartworm treatment. \nMessage us if you would like to meet Gunner!",

            "description": "Meet Reyna! Reyna is a very sweet and active 3 year old Pit mix! Reyna is looking for an owner that has experience with dogs that need some training. Reyna probably never had a stable routine or anyone that worked too much with her, but you can tell that she wants to learn! She is a very smart girl and is very food motivated. All she wants to do is make you happy, but she may need some patience and a stearn voice to make sure she knows who the boss is! Reyna came to us quite starved of food, which has made her develop some guarding of high value treats and food. Simple fix to that, leave her alone while she eats! Reyna is a big sweetheart and just wants a chance at the loving life she so greatly deserves! She has not met any dogs here yet, but does seem like she might like a playmate. She would also probably do fine in a home with a cat. Reyna would do best in a home without young kids, but would probably enjoy older (13+) kids to play with. If you are interested in meeting Reyna, please fill out a questionnaire (either in person or online at gobroomecounty.com/shelter) and staff will contactvthose that seem to match the needs of Reyna! If you have further questions about Reyna, please call the shelter (607)778-2493 or email us at muttsrus@broomecounty.us.",

            "description": "MEET MOJO!!\n\nMojo is an incredible pup. There's something about his eye contact and facial expression that's just a little different than any other dog we've spent time with - it's like he can understand us when we speak. He's typically very playful, energetic and inquisitive, and loves to snuggle. He's very bright, and very trainable--we were able to teach sit and stay in just a few minutes, and his recall is also strong. Recently, we have realized that he's able to learn the names of his toys and distinguish between them and have been trying to build that vocabulary. He loves a romp in the yard and loves to chase a ball. Most of the day, though, he's content to relax and nap.\n\nMojo has issues with aggression that are problematic. Based on the trainers and behaviorists, it is clear that they are all fear-based aggression. (he's is not aggressive due to dominance). We were recently prescribed a drug (Clonodine) that enables him to walk outside comfortably (loose-leash and happy), but is reactive is people and dogs. He has an issue with resource guarding and has occasionally been reactive in the house. Mojo will need a person who is familiar with fear based aggression and reactivity. We know the right person is out that that can help this great dog.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue. Different policies and fees may apply.",

            "description": "Surely someone wants to get Busy!\n\nThis fabulously rambunctious and cuddly girl is quite the partner in crime. Busy is quite smart and has the skills to show for it. She knows basic commands such as come, sit, lie down and give a paw. She'll even put a paw on your shoulder if she feels you need some comforting. In her previous home, we were told that Busy has a high prey drive, which is all about management. Her keen sense of smell and likely some genetics mean that as her owner you will need to be vigilant when out on walks as she can sense a squirrel up a tree from miles away - and try to drag you along for the ride while she hunts it. Leash training here in shelter has been a successful work in progress and will likely need to be continued. \n\nShe is selectively dog reactive, can get quite excited when she meets new people and has a low tolerance for loud overexcited groups of people or children. So maybe no other pets in the home, and no dog parks. She does have some food allergies and loves her Kirkland Salmon and sweet potato dry kibble. Please know that she may have some age on her, but if her prey drive takes over she can jump/climb 5-6 ft fence. Housing options will be up for discussion. \n\n\n\nDue to the current COVID-19 pandemic our adoption process has changed. \nPlease visit our website for more information on the adoption process and to fill out an application. \n\nhttps://www.spca.bc.ca/adoption/how-to-adopt \n\nAll adoptions are by appointment only once we have received an application.\n***Due to the high number of applications we receive for our animals, we will only be contacting potential adopters to further review their application***\nThank you and we look forward to reviewing your application.\n\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Brown Weight: 27.2kg Age: 7yrs 8mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

Prospective adopters must be able to travel to San Antonio to complete the adoption process. Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\nAaron is an adorable 4-month-old Brussels Griffon blend who weighs approximately 9 pounds. Aaron is a very active puppy. He is highly intelligent and would benefit from a professional puppy training course. Aaron is a problem-solver and this can at times be to his determent as he is a flight risk and an escape artist. He absolutely must never be left unattended while outdoors as he can climb a low fence or dig under a fence. For these reasons, Aaron will not be placed in a home with children. Aaron can also be vocal when left alone and would not be a good match for the apartment lifestyle.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for his entire life (up to 15+ years or more) - not just until his puppy cuteness wears off.\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\nLike most puppies, he may chew on anything within his reach to include but not limited to baseboards, shoes, socks, children's toys, electrical cords, plants, etc.\nHis adoption fee is $300. This includes his neuter surgery, rabies vaccination, Nobivac Canine 1-DAPP vaccinations, Bravecto, Drontal Plus, Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablet, 24PetWatch microchip, leash and collar, and a trial offer for 24PetWatch Pet Insurance.\nPlease be aware that puppies and small breed dogs do get adopted quickly so interested parties are encouraged to apply online at www.saspca.org.\nPlease ensure your application is complete before submitting. We do verify property ownership, landlord references, apartment/HOA restrictions, veterinary references, and criminal histories.\nOur adoption events are held each Saturday at Petco located in the Northwoods Shopping Center at 18138 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio TX 78232. Event hours are 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\nAdditional questions may be directed to sagdinfo@gmail.com.\n** This dog is in a foster home in San Antonio, TX.

I show my foster mom every day what a loving and smart boy I am! I make sure to offer kisses any time I can as well as give a paw to show affection. I'm really good at ringing the bell to show foster mom when I have to go potty outside. I love food and take treats nicely. Foster mom says I'm one of her best dogs to walk and I love the exercise. I'm working on kennel training and trying to remember that it's a safe space for me. I really love having a foster brother to help me with my confidence. Some of my favorite things are: squeaky toys, chew bones, going for walks, playing with my foster brother and snuggling. \n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297.

Like all Great Pyrenees she loves to wander off and can escape if she wants to, but has learned to come on recall. She has very good house manners and knows her obedience commands well. She is completely house trained and has never been destructive with items in the house. She loves to have lots and lots of affection from her owner and will nudge and paw to get more if the petting stops. \n\nWinter would be a good match in a home where she can be the center of attention and is the only dog in the house and with no children since she is still unpredictable with kids, strangers, and is competitive for attention. She can be fearful of new people and loud or sudden movement and noises, but is a good communicator when she is uncomfortable with the situation. \n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and videos on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/ Ask to meet me today!!\n \nAdoption fee: $450\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit.

            "description": "weight: \nestimated age: \n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

Pupper's was adopted from a rural shelter as a nine week old puppy. 8 months later Pupper's turned up as a stray at that same shelter. Although he was microchipped, his \"family\" did not reclaim him. Pupper's is a sweet boy, but understandably a tad shy as he most likely was not treated well by his prior \"family\". Pupper's gets along well with other dogs and people and is looking for a patient loving family who can give him some training and show him the meaning of love. Let's find Pupper's a real family this time around! Email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org Pupper's is located in Southern California.",

She came to us in December, 2019, when her owner became homeless and could no longer care for Mercedes and older gal pal, Midnight.  We tried for quite a while to get Mercedes and Midnight adopted together, assuming that they were very bonded, but it turns out that they could take or leave each other.  Mercedes still has lots of energy at her age, and she seemed to be a bit much at times for Midnight.  They can certainly be adopted together but they don't need to be.  Aside from Midnight, Mercedes does not get along with other pets.  She does, however, absolutely adore people, and she can't get enough attention.  She's playful and active, and well-behaved too.  Mercedes is housebroken and walks well on a leash, and no one will love you more than her if you give her a chance!  File#29430  12/10/19\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org to meet Mercedes.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required.

Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

            "description": "Vixen is a 6 \u00bd year old spayed black female with natural ears who came back into rescue through no fault of her own. She is currently in a foster home with no children or pets and is adjusting well. Vixen is a generally quiet and clean girl who loves her stuffies and fleece blankets. She is initially standoffish with people especial men. She has growled at a few men in and outside her previous home on occasion, but nothing aggressive. She travels very well and walks nicely on leash. She is a \u201cbeefy\u201d girl who loves her food and treats. She is quite the talker, whiner, and a groaner especially when she thinks it is time to eat. She is pacing a lot but we expect that is just part of her transition process. Vixen is house trained and can be trusted with free run of the house when the foster parent is out.\n\nIn her original home, Vixen lives with other Danes and her best buddy was a male. She had some exposure to barn cats there, but we are not sure if any of it was up close and personal. She was attacked by one of the female dogs in the house and since then has been female selective, so she would do best in a home with only male dogs.\n\nIn her second home, she lived with teenage boys and guinea pigs. She was initially curios about the guinea pigs, but then just ignored them. She seems to have a high prey drive as she aggressively chases squirrels and neighbor\u2019s cats when they are in her yard. Thus, she will not be placed with cats or small animals. Vixen is seeking a new permanent home that will help her feel secure and get back her girlish figure. Vixen came back to MAGDRL in January 2021 (2).\n<p><br /><br />For more info on this dog and our adoption policies, visit <a href=\"http://www.padanerescue.com\">PA MAGDRL at http://www.padanerescue.com</a>.

She is great with other dogs and would do best with a canine companion in the household. She loves to play with toys and bones and is great with sharing.\n\nYoda is house trained and sleeps through the night. She is the perfect balanced dog you can go explore with or chill and watch a movie. She is nervous with people at first but she works through it quickly. The best fit for her would be somebody to encourage her through some of the nervous tendencies she has. She does great in the car and already knows sit and is working on down.\n\nShe would do best with older kids (age 12+) if any, because she does get nervous around loud noises . She needs a cheerleader to help her through and let her know she is alright and boost her confidence. Yoda loves to be warm and cuddle in blankets. She is looking for somebody to explore with.\n\n Want to Adopt? 1) Fill out an application on theluckypuppy.org The donation fees are minimum $475 for puppies up to 6 months, minimum $400 for dogs 7 months to 6 years and minimum $ 300 for 7+ years/Special Needs. 2) Once your application is in, our adoption coordinator will contact you and complete a vet check and home visit (possibly electronic). 3) Once approved, please schedule a meet and greet to see the dogs. Meet and greets are by appointment only for approved adopters.\n\nYoda is available in NY through the Go North Program of The Lucky Puppy Rescue centered in Bonifay and Panama City, FL (NY Lic #1054). This dog is in NY currently. The minimum donation $400 adoption fee includes transportation from FL to NY, spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you!

THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION \n\nMEET FITZGERALD\u2026.known to all his friends as \u201cFitz or Fitzy.\u201d  This adorable, tri colored, 3 yr old, 12 lb Shih Tzu mix came from the SEAACA shelter when the person who was supposed to adopt him never showed up!  Lucky us!   Lucky Fitz!!  He had a small growth on the back of his neck, which we had removed.  He was a little slow to warm up \u2014 like 10 minutes and he was jumping into my arms!  He is very people oriented and we are currently fostering him with another dog to see if he would be happier with a canine companion or not.  He is a kissy face boy who loves his people and he will whine/cry for a few minutes when you leave him, so he doesn\u2019t really like being left behind!  He seems to be potty trained or will go on a pad if he has to go out before you take him (but you know we never guarantee how he will be at your house!!).  He likes toys and still trying to figure out what to do with them!  He likes other dogs but is still a little shy and blossoming.  He would be fine with older kids (over 10 yrs) as he is very active and can scratch you when he jumps up on you (small children wouldn\u2019t like that)!  Loves to go on his walks and meet other people on the street.  He is happy and playful\u2026but we are still learning more about him.\n\nWe have only had him a short time, so please check back for updates.  HE WILL BE AVAILABLE FEBRUARY 15.\n\nOur website is updated daily. Please do not apply for this dog unless your home fits the specified criteria. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, groomed, vet checked, dewormed, deflea'd and come with a leash, collar and ID If you are interested in adopting this dog from Lhasa Happy Homes, please complete the adoption application via the link below: Adoption (Online) Application: https://lhasahappyhomes.org/adoptions/adoption-application/. We will contact you once it has been reviewed. \n\nDuring the COVID-19 quarantine, Lhasa Happy Homes will NOT be holding weekly adoption events. We will set up individual meet & greets with APPROVED applicants once they have submitted a video tour of their home. \n\nYou can check our Events Calendar at http://www.lhasahappyhomes.org/HLM_Custom_Calendar.aspx.\n\nThanks for thinking rescue and adoption\u2026and for considering saving a life. It will be the best gift you ever give yourself or your family.",

            "description": "weight: \nestimated age: \n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

Please see our website for our adoption application at\n\nhttps://homeatlasths.org/dog-adoption-application/\n\nand information on the adoption process\n\nMeet Joe! This old man was brought to HAL back in November after someone found  him abandoned on an old highway. He was covered in growths both small and large. Some even dangled several inches from his body making it uncomfortable for him to get around.  Since being at HAL Joe has had his much needed surgery to have his growths removed.  He is now happier and much more comfortable.  He has quite the pep in his step.  He is about 13 years old and we believe him to be a lab mix.  He keeps his kennel space clean which shows signs that he may be house trained. Although we always remind adopters that new surroundings can provide a slight learning curve in their new environment so accidents can happen. This old man would love a warm and comfy home to call his very own for the remainder of his golden years.  He doesn't seem to mind other dogs as long as they are older and his own speed slow, gentle and lazy ;) he has not paid any mind to the kitties here either.  If he goes to a home with children we recommend that they are older so that they are not to rambunctious for this sweet guy.  Joe's adoption fee is $125.00 this includes his neuter, utd on his vaccines, micro chipped, free vet visit within the first two weeks of adoption and free custom engraved ID tag.",

            "description": "George is a 6 \u00bd year old neutered fawn male with natural ears who came into rescue due to a divorce. He recently suffered some very traumatic events including a near-death experience shortly there after lost his older female Dane sister with whom he was very attached. Despite all of this, he is adjusting very well in his current foster home where he lives with a 5-year-old spayed female Dane and 5-year-old neutered Pitbull and proving to be a perfect gentleman.\n\nGeorge is affectionate and playful, but also quiet and keeps to himself right now. He travels very well and walks very well on leash. George is housebroken and can be trusted to roam freely while the foster is out.\n\nGeorge is good with children and other dogs. His only exposure to cats that we are aware of was in the home where he stayed a few days prior to coming in to rescue. The two older cats and George just looked at each other and the cats walked away.\nGeorge came into MAGDRL in January 2021 (2).\n<p><br /><br />For more info on this dog and our adoption policies, visit <a href=\"http://www.padanerescue.com\">PA MAGDRL at http://www.padanerescue.com</a>.

            "description": "Cody and Oreo were left orphaned when their dad passed away from COVID. \n\nOreo (blk and tan) is a 12 year old Yorkipoo. He loves to wander around the house and is pretty independent. He isn't too snuggly, but we love watching him as he enjoys rolling around in blankets or on the carpet and he loves toys and food. \n\nCody (white) is a 7 year old Maltese/Terrier mix. He is more shy, sensitive, and submissive. He follows Oreo wherever he goes. Cody doesn't want to get in anyone's way and even moves if someone tries to eat from his own food bowl! It took Cody a couple weeks to get comfortable enough to jump on the couch and snuggle with people, but he definitely does now! He just needs someone to give him time to adjust. \n\nOreo is almost completely deaf and has slight vision loss but he doesn't have any issues getting around. Just don't expect him to come when he is called. He sleeps very soundly and snores a little at night. He just had bloodwork done which was totally normal and a dental so he is set for awhile.\n\nThey lived outside prior to coming to us so they are still being housebroken now. They are both crate trained (they sleep in same crate) and don't have accidents in there. When loose, Oreo does try to tell you when he has to pee by going to the door, but if you don't take him out right away, he does urinate inside. Cody is learning pretty quickly and is almost housebroken now. \n\nThey both get along with other dogs and cats. They are neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. Cody and Oreo are beautiful, sweet dogs and would be a great pair to relax at home with!\n\n If interested in meeting, submit your applications now at www.dominoeffectanimalrescue.org!",

Prospective adopters must be able to travel to San Antonio to complete the adoption process. Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\nAaron is an adorable 4-month-old Brussels Griffon blend who weighs approximately 9 pounds. Aaron is a very active puppy. He is highly intelligent and would benefit from a professional puppy training course. Aaron is a problem-solver and this can at times be to his determent as he is a flight risk and an escape artist. He absolutely must never be left unattended while outdoors as he can climb a low fence or dig under a fence. For these reasons, Aaron will not be placed in a home with children. Aaron can also be vocal when left alone and would not be a good match for the apartment lifestyle.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for his entire life (up to 15+ years or more) - not just until his puppy cuteness wears off.\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\nLike most puppies, he may chew on anything within his reach to include but not limited to baseboards, shoes, socks, children's toys, electrical cords, plants, etc.\nHis adoption fee is $300. This includes his neuter surgery, rabies vaccination, Nobivac Canine 1-DAPP vaccinations, Bravecto, Drontal Plus, Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablet, 24PetWatch microchip, leash and collar, and a trial offer for 24PetWatch Pet Insurance.\nPlease be aware that puppies and small breed dogs do get adopted quickly so interested parties are encouraged to apply online at www.saspca.org.\nPlease ensure your application is complete before submitting. We do verify property ownership, landlord references, apartment/HOA restrictions, veterinary references, and criminal histories.\nOur adoption events are held each Saturday at Petco located in the Northwoods Shopping Center at 18138 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio TX 78232. Event hours are 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\nAdditional questions may be directed to sagdinfo@gmail.com.\n** This dog is in a foster home in San Antonio, TX. Prospective adopters must be able to travel to San Antonio to complete the adoption process. Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\n\n- IMPORTANT INFORMATION -\n\nSASPCA Homeward Bound Dog Rescue and San Antonio Great Dane Rescue are 501(c)(3) foster-based rescue groups based in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nOur group focuses on assisting open admission shelters in South Texas where over 32,000 dogs and cats are euthanized each year.\n\nOur puppies and dogs are completely vetted and live in foster homes. They are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and tested for heartworm disease.All adoptions include one month of flea and heartworm preventative, leash and collar, and opportunity to enroll in a 30-day trial of pet insurance.\n\nOur adoption events are held each Saturday at Petco located in the Northwoods Shopping Center at 18138 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio, TX 78232.

Theos is just over one year old and is fully grown at his big boy status of 56 pounds. Theos is still a little nervous and is taking his time getting comfortable on walks or when he's all alone. He'll need a patient owner who will help him work through these issues, but we know he'll do great given enough time (and TLC, of course). In the meantime he enjoys getting pets and scratches or hanging out with his favorite stuffed animal friends.\n\nTheos would do vest in an adult-only home where he's the only pup in the home. \n\nIf you're interested in this cutie, you must click \"Apply for Adoption\" to submit an online application.\n\nIf you're viewing this animal on Petfinder, please visit the animal's page on Bideawee.org and click on the \"Apply for Adoption\" button to submit an adoption application!",

I was brought in to the pound as a stray, so it was pretty scary and I kept close to my best friend at the time, Polly \u2013 she\u2019s also looking for a new home, by the way. My foster mom says I\u2019m a little shy but very loving. I like the company of other dogs but I\u2019m a mellow girl. I\u2019m good with children, I\u2019m crate-trained and I walk well on the leash. I\u2019m still working on figuring out the potty training at my foster mom\u2019s place but everything is so new here still, so give me a little more time and I think I will get it and will be fine. I\u2019m just a little slower with getting used to new environments. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping when you fall in love with me, I will get to stay with you forever.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Willa is about 4 years old and weighs 12 lbs.]\n\n(2101)",

This girl gets so excited that when she gives kisses she nips a little bit. I would say kids 6 or older would be good for her! \n\nShe is super smart and all terrier. She needs consistency with potty training, learning what is ok to chew on and lots of time to play to wear herself out. She would benefit from a training class! We know just the place! She is the happiest most sweetest girl who loves attention. \n\nApplications can be found at www.trackingintheshadows.com.

            "description": "weight: \nestimated age: \n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

He is in a foster home with multiple other dogs of similar size and gets along great with them all.  His heartworm treatment will mean kennel rest with low activity while the worms die and are expelled thru the blood stream.  Therefore a home with much activity is not suitable for this fellow.

I'm sure you want to know all the great things about Stewart, but where do we start? He loves to cuddle and snuggle, and you'll love it too because he is soft like a bunny rabbit! He's incredibly well-behaved, sleeping in his crate and walking on a leash with no problems. Above all else, Stewart is most proud about how good he is when it's time to go to the restroom: he has no problem waiting until you're home to go potty!\n\nStewart has had a hard couple of months since his owner passed away around Christmas. He has a bit of separation anxiety, but he also has so much love to give. If you adopt Stewart, he'll be your best friend in no time. So if you're in the market for a new bestie, head to Paws in the City to learn more.\n\nFor adoption information or to complete an application, please go to: http://www.pawsinthecity.org/adopt.htm\n\nReferences and a home visit are required for all adoptions.",

She was rescued by the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society from a Texas animal shelter as an owner surrender.\n\nLicorice is a sweet girl who requires a lot of love, attention, and patient. She likes to snuggle and is content being close to her person. She is okay with cats and is good with other dogs.\n\nShe will thrive in an adult-only home, and older, considerate children may be okay. She would require a canine companion her size. She needs members in her family that will treasure her for the rest of her life. Please complete an Adoption Application if you are that family or person. She is only available for adoption in OR and WA.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\n\tOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\tPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\tPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\tPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\tApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\tThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\nAdoption Fee $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org .\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD FOR AN UPCOMING ADOPTION APPOINTMENT Solstice is a lovely 1-year-old mixed-breed girl who currently weighs about 61 pounds. She came to SFAS as a stray. Here at the shelter, Solstice has taken her time getting used to her new environment. She has not been a huge fan of playgroup but we can always conduct a meet n greet with your dog to see if they get along. Solstice's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Solstice or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

This sweet boy is very shy, but would really like to be friends- he just needs your help! Because Hawkeye is so shy, he would do best in a home with teens and up. Hawkeye has gotten along with the other calm dogs here at the shelter, but can be overwhelmed by rambunctious dogs and must meet new canine companions one-on-one to ensure they are a good match. Hawkeye would benefit from positive, reward-based training classes designed to boost his confidence. This pup will require guidance and supervision learning to use the bathroom outside only, but our staff can give you tips to help with this.",

He was surrendered to a local emergency vet as he was having difficulty getting around and had multiple wounds. From the emergency vet, he was transferred to PACC and has spent the last few weeks in the shelter's clinic. Despite his condition, Rocky has been friendly and sweet since arriving at PACC and has been tolerant of all the handling from the clinic staff. When meeting other PACC dogs, he was social and tolerant with the other dogs. He had good greetings and hung out with the other dogs and explored the yard. Overall, he is easy going, friendly and affectionate with the handlers. Rocky had a brief break in a home. He slept inside on his own dog bed, was housebroken. Volunteers say he is sweet, gentle and easy going. Rocky is a gentle guy who needs a place to continue to heal, with someone who can commit to his care. Ask about helping Rocky today!",

S'more was found as a stray and spent a few weeks with his finders before they realized he was in need of some medical attention. S'more has some trouble with his paw, but he's not letting that get him down. In play group, S'more was a little nervous at first but once he got going, he relaxed and greeted other dogs appropriately. Staffers say he's a very sweet fella, just a little bit nervous. In S'mores temporary home, he spent time with a Chihuahua and kids (ages 12 and 13) and reportedly did well. He's housetrained and was on his very best behavior in the home. S'more is a sweet guy who is winning hearts at PACC right and left. If you need a sweet treat in your life, make an appointment to meet S'more today.",

            "description": "Hi everyone! My name is Doodle, and I am about 12 years old, and a little girl at about 13 lbs. I am a sweet girl, very calm, and I love giving lots of kisses! I just need lots and lots of love. I am house trained. I am a very chill baby, and just love to snuggle and follow my humans around. I need a home with no stairs, a solid fence, and without a pool, to keep me safe, since I cannot see or hear very well now, and my joints prefer solid ground! I am very well-behaved, and am looking for a home where I can relax, snuggle, and get lots of love! My adoption fee is $75, but if you are a senior human over 65, my adoption fee is waived.

            "description": "Posted: 01/30/21\n\nMolly is a 7 1/2 yr old sweetie who looks like a Lab mix. She is spayed, microchipped and up to date on shots. She is a skinny 50 lbs and may fill out to about 55 or so.\n\nMolly was surrendered when her owner could no longer take care of her.  Molly was diagnosed with exocrine  pancreatic insufficient, EPI.  Her pancreas does not create the enzymes to digest her food and provide her body with nutrients. We are happy to report that she is doing well taking pancreatic enzymes will every meal, her prescription diet.  If it sounds expensive, it is.  \n\nMolly is eating Science Diet ID - Low Fat, both kibble and canned with a little pumpkin puree on top.  Each meal needs to prepped with her prescription pancreatic enzymes.  They are mixed in her meal and take 15-20 minutes to start working.  We are doing this 3 times a day with great success.  Three meals a day and EPI warrant a number of bathroom breaks,  Molly is housebroken and lets me know when she has to go out, even at 4 am!\n\nMolly is worth it!  She is living with four other dogs and loves to cuddle with her foster family.  She is sweet, sensitive, and playful.  She loves to play with the other dogs in the fenced in yard, toss around her stuffed toys, and get pet whenever she can.  She walks pretty well on leash and is always so excited to go out. We have noticed that she takes a number of visits to get comfortable around new men and warms up to women quite easily.\n\nI feed her separately from the other dogs.  While she does not guard her food from people, she does not like other dogs around her food.  My vet told me that this is not uncommon with EPI dogs.  Three meals a day has helped from getting overly hungry during the day.\n\n\nMolly needs someone who is home often to maintain her three meals a day and bathroom breaks. Plus, I am estimated the monthly cost of her meds and special diet to be between $550 - $700/month.  She cannot go a day without her medication and plant-based alternatives will not work.\n\nMolly's adoption fee is $300. She is being fostered in Cambridge, MA and Newry, ME.\n\nWANT TO ADOPT MOLLY?\nPlease copy and paste the following URL into your browser to complete an application. http://alldogrescue.org/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/\n\nMolly's foster mom will be in touch within 48 hours of receipt of your application.",

He is house trained. \nWhen Ollie gets really wound up, he gets jumpy and can get a little mouthy. For this reason, he cannot be adopted into a home with small children. Ollie enjoys playing with other dogs, but can sometimes be picky with his playmates (no small dogs and no cats).

He loves to play chase and fetch a ball or a toy. He even enjoys following the kitties around the house and plays gentle with them. He is looking for an active family with a fur buddy to hang out with. He will lick your nose, mouth and eyes and make you pee your pants laughing. If you need a little sunshine in your life, Noodle is your guy !!\n\n=========================================================\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\n\nPuppies\nthat are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations.\n\nChildren under 8 years old\noften are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

I'm a well rounded dog-I really love people and have been friendly with dogs at the shelter. It's unknown if I would get along with cats, dogs, or kids in a home since I came in as a stray. I need to be walked on a harness since I can pull too much and make myself cough. I like to play and run around, but I also like to stop and smell the roses, and the grass, and the trees, and the rocks-basically I like to smell everything! I sometimes can bark a lot, so if you're neighbors are really close they might not be too happy hearing me all the time. \n\nJinx is 4 years old.\nMeet and greet with your dog is required.\n",

Diego is very food motivated, with a little time/effort and a bag of treats, we believe he will learn basic commands very quickly.\nDiego's adoption fee is $250. This fee goes toward helping more animals in need.\nHe is neutered, up to date on his vaccines, and microchipped.\nIf you feel like you are the human for Diego , you can fill out an application at\nfurfriends4life.org/adoptionaplication/\nAny further questions feel free to call/text 661-431-4607\nOr email at\nfurfriends4liferescue@gmail.com",

I am a 2 and a half year old Pitbull mix looking for my furever home!Just like my name says,I love to use my singing voice to let you know how much I love you! I love to spend time out in the doggie play yard running around and chasing toys. I don\u2019t prefer to share the stage with anyone and I like to rock out by myself, so I must be the single dog in your home. I need someone who will be dedicated to helping me learn some leash manners and some new tricks! I am a very smart boy who is treat motivated! My friends here say I should be in the Rock and Ruff Hall of Fame for what a good boy I am! Come on by AFHS to meet me and we can jam together!\n\nEddie is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

            "description": "Hello! Thank you for checking out Phi's listing. Please read carefully for details on our adoption process:\n\u2022First, please note that we are unable to receive correspondence through Petfinder\u2019s system. Any messages sent through Petfinder or any buttons on this listing will unfortunately not reach us. If you\u2019re interested in adopting please visit www.sanctuaryrescue.com and submit an adoption questionnaire under the forms section.\n\u2022 Applications for puppies are open for two to three days in order to give ample opportunity to prospective adopters. At the end of this 48-72 hour period we will change the adoption listing to \u201cApplications Closed\u201d. At this point we will begin reviewing all applications received. Next, foster parents will contact approved applicants to set up a meet and greet. This can take up to 1 to 2 weeks.\n\u2022 Once a dog is officially adopted we will remove its listing from Petfinder. So if this listing is gone, this dog has found its forever family and is no longer available.\n\u2022 Since Covid lockdown orders, we have seen a massive increase in people interested in adopting dogs (yay!). This means each dog, especially puppies, receive multiple applications in the couple of days we have applications open. There is usually several applicants for one puppy. If it doesn\u2019t work out this time, please understand this is not a personal judgement but likely a result of supply and demand. We encourage you to reapply in the future.\n\nThis lucky puppy found his way to the home of a Sanctuary Rescue foster with mom and siblings at just one day old. Mom is a beautiful, 50pound-ish, black lab-looking mix. We never met dad so breed and size is a pure guess. We estimate he'll be in the 60-70 pound range when full grown. Phi spends his time wrestling with the other pups in the house, lounging around the house, playing tug and just enjoying some good old puppy fun. Phi is well socialized and love everyone they meet. He is young enough to learn about cats.\n\nThis is Phi. He is a sweet little guy that LOVES attention. He loves to ruff house, carry around sticks around the yard and likes to play with kids and other dogs.\n\nPhi's adoption fee is $295, which includes age-appropriate vaccinations, neuter, and microchip. If you would like to make this handsome pup a part of your family, please visit sanctuaryrescue.com and complete an adoption questionnaire under the \u201cForms\u201d tab.",

He's calm and quiet in his run in the shelter, and knows \"sit.\" Beauregard came into the shelter as a lost dog on Jan. 23, and his family has not come to find him. He is about 4 years old and weighs 68 pounds. He has not been neutered yet, but the vet will take care of that soon. He is up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 803 using ID#626995.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

A gentle fella raised me and I have been loved on a lot. I have no clue that I am a pit bull. Some of us get a bad rap, because people think pit bull fighting is great sport. Really ,watching an animal attack another is fun? I am so glad no one expected that of me. I am one big baby, that has never had a bad day. I am happy and very loyal to my people. I was living in an apartment complex and took the elevator to the outdoors. I am now on freedom farm and run out the dog door when ever I want. I went from city to country. My owner could not take me with him, when he moved out of the apartment. I was so lucky to move into the rescue. I am great with dogs and love to play. I am fine with all people, children and dogs. I have not met a cat yet. I am house trained and can be trusted loose, when left alone.I am pretty much a perfect girl. I love to give kisses and be loved on. I could be the poster child for pit bulls. It is all how we are raised. We are great dogs, when not with the wrong owner. For those people that fight us to make money, all I have to say is -get a job. I am here waiting for you to make me the center of your world and you will be mine. Isn't that what all of us dogs of all breeds want? Hugs and kisses.....\n\nIf interested, you can easily fill out an adoption application by clicking here:\n\nadoption application\n\nFor anyone viewing this on Petfinder, if you are interested in adopting this animal you will need to go to our website www.rosesrescue.net to fill out the online adoption application.

They are 3-month-old mixes of Plott Hound and Shepherd weighing only 15 puppy pounds but heading to a mature weight of about 50. Short coats of brown brindle set them apart from many other dogs; they love being held like a baby and having a good tummy scratch! Each is loving and sweet with an overall excellent temperament which clearly shows when they're around people and other dogs. A truly awesome litter! Their foster knows what she's talking about! (posted 1/29/21, ME)\n**It is rare that we know with certainty the ages or mixes that make up our dogs, but we do our best to be as accurate as possible based upon our experience. **\nAdoption: $350 which covers quarantine, shots, worming, food, medical records, spaying/neutering,microchip and an Alabama State Health Certificate.\nTransport, if needed : $140.00 We consider the transport to be of great importance and, as such, take particular care of the dogs during the trip from Alabama. We make every effort to arrive with healthy and minimally stressed dogs.",

This little man was rescued from a high kill shelter along with several other pups after their owner was no longer able to care for them. Dinky is one of the sweetest and most loving boys you'll ever meet! He wants nothing more than to be with his people and would sit in your lap all day if you let him! Dinky loves to snuggle up in bed or cuddle on the couch, and is one of the cutest little boys you've ever seen! He is great with other dogs and seems to enjoy the companionship of his canine pals. Dinky is working on his housebreaking and crate-training and is learning how to walk on a leash. We just love this adorable boy and know he will make a wonderful companion for the person willing to give him the time and attention he deserves! Please help us find Dinky the forever home he's been dreaming of! \n\nInterested in adopting?

He can be quite shy with new people, but once he warms up he can't get close enough to you. He' knows some basic obedience commands such as \"sit\". He loves to play with toys of any kind and enjoys running around in the yard for as long as he can. He shows potential with other dogs, but with a slow introduction she'll likely warm up quickly. Due to his shyness, If there are children in the home, the would need to be 13 or older.\n\nIf Patriot looks like the dog you're looking for, give our adoption counselors a call at 330-487-0333 ext 226 to learn more about how our adoption by appointment program works!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Seven - yup, just like the number, lucky number Seven! I'm such a happy and friendly 53 pound pup! I love going for long walks in nature or around the neighborhood -- the longest we've walked was on a 7 mile trail. I do great on car rides too. I stay in my seat for the whole ride and either snooze or put my head as close to my foster mom as I can and stare at her until she can give me pets. I'm still just a baby so everything is very interesting to me, but a treat really grabs my focus fast I'm a quick learner too -- I already know how to sit, stay, wait, and come. I'm good on a leash and don't have much interest in other creatures, like other dogs, squirrels, deer, or little humans, Sometimes, I get too excited when I'm playing and I use my mouth more than I should and it's hard for me to tell where the toy ends and my human begins. My foster mom and I have been working on that, but it's harder than it looks and I'd love to continue practicing this with my new family. I don't bark, the only time my foster mom heard me bark was when I saw my reflection in the mirror, but once I realized it was me, I've found that looking in the mirror is fun! I snore during my naps and like to make grunting sounds (my foster mom sometimes calls me Mr. Pig) but I'm usually a very quiet pal. I've had some play dates with other dogs, too, and they've been really fun but they always get tired faster than I do. \n\nOne of my favorite things to do is cuddle. I love being as close to my human as possible, so if you sit down next to me I'll immediately wiggle my way over and snuggle my head (and sometimes my whole body) right into your lap. I can stay like that for hours! I have plenty of love and snuggles to share but my high-energy is too much sometimes for even me to contain, so I don't think I'll work well with small humans, but having another dog buddy around could help me manage my energy and help with my focus. \n\nFor more info, or to meet me virtually, contact AdoptSeven@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Burrito! I am an 4 year old, 5.5lb chihuahua and totally adorable.\n\nI have special needs and am paralyzed in my back legs. I can drag my legs behind me and get around okay, but I do best in my wheelchair. A home with no steps would be super cool. I LOVE my person (my foster mom right now)...and admit that I didn't have a good attitude when I was at the vet. They called me a little landshark! Lol... so, if you can be a little patient and let me make sure you are safe, we will do okay.\n\nOh, o\n\nne more thing. I am not \"potty trained\" but am able to hold my pee and poop until it just surprises me and comes out (kinda like it's ready to come out, but I don't know). Totally pooped on my foster mom a few days ago... but she was nice about it and cleaned me up. Uhm... and full disclosure, I was getting in her bed and peed while dragging myself over her pillow... that was a first. I normally sleep through the night without accidents. Clean sheets and sweet dreams!\n\nThank you for checking out my bio, please check back for an update. My life was saved recently and we are getting me safe and warm. Information will be updated as soon as I get settled in at my foster home.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

It in no way obligates you to adopt, it is simply part of our process. If the dog you are interested in is adopted before you can meet them or if we do not currently have a dog you are interested in we still encourage you to go through the approval process. Then you will be pre-approved and ready to adopt when a dog does come along that you are interested in. Apply at www.arizonacattledogrescue.org\n\nJulio is a stunningly beautiful boy who came to us a year ago. He is just over a year old now. He was adopted and then returned due to a family issue and through no fault of his own.\n\nHe is a very sweet boy who is quite sensitive. He LOVES other dogs and would excel in a home with another dog to help bolster his confidence. He would also do well as an only pup in the house if given stability and direction.\n\nJulio is looking for someone who will have a little patience in gaining his trust. \n\nHe loves being outdoors. Older kids are recommended for Julio and we are unsure regarding interaction with cats. He did live the last few weeks with a tiny pug puppy and was very gentle with it.",

He has met another dog and wanted to play, but his play style is a little rough so doggie friends would need to be ok with that.  He jumps up a lot so very small children might not be a good idea.  We don't know how he would do with cats.\n\nIrvin is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

I did not come from a place that took care of me or showed me what love was. The nice people at the shelter have made me nice and healthy and they are learning more and more about me every day. I am a very affectionate boy who loves to give hugs and kisses. I have a pittie wiggle down! I LOVE playing fetch. I get along with most dogs but like to meet my friend companions before hand.\nI was in a very nice foster home for a bit but sadly I had to come back to the shelter because I was a little too territorial of my person and her property. I wanted to protect her from all the bad in the world, because that is all I have ever known. I hope to find a home that will work with me on this issue and keep me secure if new people come to the home until I realize they are okay. I promise I want to learn. I am VERY SMART.\n\nYou can meet PJ 1pm-4pm at 3016 Milam Dr. Brownwood, Texas 76801\n(325) 646-0617\n\nRescue Inquiries:\nRescuecorrinesmithanimalcenter@gmail.com",

When I wore out, I really like to cuddle and for you to rub my belly. I know my basic commands sit, stay down. I have also learned paw, crawl. I am crate trained. I hate when my ears get wet and I'm not a fan of my nails being clipped. I love people and hope to have a home with a loving family. \n\nGigi can be met any day of the week 1pm-4pm at 3016 Milam Dr. Brownwood, Texas 325-646-0617\n\n*Adoption only*",

She has a medium energy level and ignored a dog she met.  She doesn't seem to want to play with other dogs, so she might not appreciate a very playful in her face doggie companion.  She likes to go on walks but then also to settle down with you and enjoy a good tv show.  Come meet Ethel today.\n\nEthel is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

I'm good with cats and other dogs. It does take time for me to warm up and become comfortable in new places. I was found under a trailer and was pretty skinny from not eating well. Since I've been with my foster mom she has been introducing me to people the correct way since I'm a little nervous at first. I've been doing really good with new people since I know not all people are going to hurt me. I've started gaining weight and am starting to look and act like more like the puppy. I'm affraid I'm not going to get my next meal so I do like to guard my food so I need to be fed alone or in a low trafficked of the home and preferably a home with no young children. I'm very smart I have already learned to sit and wait for my foster mom to put the food bowl down for me. She loves me very much but she wants me to find the perfect forever home!!\nFoster Mom Note: Since he is nervous around new people I instuct them to not touch him right away, to let him get a feel for them first and since I've been doing that he has improved with greeting.\n\nSnoopy\nhas been in our Dash/Prison training program where he has learned most of his basic commands.",

AKA Bean!\n\nBean is a two year old, Pit mix waiting for her forever home.\n\nThis dog is AMAZING. She loves other dogs, loves water and is so eager to please.  She does great on walks and likes the idea of car rides - she'll jump right into the car but is a little unsure once she's there!\n\nBean unfortunately fell into the hands of the wrong people who weren't always kind. She's now afraid of loud noises and we are looking to adopt to a home with kids OVER the age of 10.  Bean comes along with pre-training sessions and is available for foster to adopt.\n\nLike our other dog friends, Bean is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped!\n\nNOTE: We do not adopt out any animals to outside a 6 hour radius from Los Angeles.\n",

I had a bit of a rough start in my life, but my foster mom tells me things will only get better. I am having some trouble with my right eye. Its either injured or infected, which may cause me to end up with a permanent wink. Can you find it in your heart to love me, even if I only have one eye? I promise it doesnt stop me from being a sweet, pretty girl!\n \nI do very well with other dogs. It can take me a little time to warm up, but I take cues very well and quickly figure out my place in the pack. I enjoy playing with other dogs and with squeaky toys! However, Im not sure if I like cats or not.\nMy foster mom is SUPER proud of me because I have not had one single accident in the house! I use the doggie door and do all of my business outside. I also do well in a crate - but ever since Ive settled into my foster home, I dont spend much time there anymore. Even when mom leaves us dogs alone in the house for a while, I wait patiently until she returns.\n \nMy favorite pastime is cuddling, but Im happy to faithfully sit close-by and wait for your attention. I have a good appetite, and I am quite athletic. I love spending time outside. Whenever one of my foster brothers or sisters goes out, Im always the first to join them. Plus, my foster mom thinks I have been very helpful scaring off moles in the backyard, so Ive been earning my keep!",

            "description": "The Bug Buggy is a one year old American Staffordshire Terrier mix who was dealt a rough hand in her first year of life. With untreated glaucoma in her left eye, it was far too damaged to be saved and had to be removed. But, you cant squash this Bug! She is recovering excellently and becoming more confident every day.\n\nAs a professional napper who dabbles in slow walks and wet kisses, Bug loves nothing more than to lay by your side. If you give this girl a toy, she will collect it by putting it in her toy pile or just lay her head on it until she feels satisfied. Bug is dog friendly, good with cats, walks well on a leash, and crate trained. She is mostly housebroken with regular outings and requires only a short walk a day to be happy. I believe she would love to live with a doggy companion to show her the joys of being a family pet.\n\nAnyone looking for a mellow girl and a pal for their current dog(s) should meet this awesome little pirate pup.\n\nBONUS: Buggy is also and overnight viral TikTok star!",

            "description": "Hercules is a Rottweiler mix, one-year old, about 80-85 lbs, came to us from an owner who had taken him on and just had too many dogs to be adding a very large dog to the mix. He is supposed to be housetrained, good with other dogs & seems to be ok with cats; unsure about children. He is very playful, loves balls and squeeky toys, loves having his tummy rubbed, stayed in a fence and walks well on a leash.\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nTo learn more about us, visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org; Phone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

The saddest! All the dogs are so incredibly sweet and loving and friendly! All love other dogs but Jasper is a cat chaser so no cats please. He LOVES to play ball in typical Labrador fashion. He is always up for a ball playing session then a good nap on his dog bed. Jasper is 6yo approx and approx 65lbs. He needs to lose a few lbs! If you are looking for an easy going pal that loves to lounge but also go for a romp in the great outdoors this is the guy for you. If you are interested in adopting this great guy and maybe even one of his pals, fill out the application at finalvictoryrescue.com.",

The owner reported he was vomiting and having diarrhea so there was some concern about Parvo.  Parvo test was negative, fecal was negative and the puppy did not exhibit any vomit or diarrhea in hospital. He is actually quite healthy.  The owner did not wish to reclaim him so he became a ward of CARE.  Juan has been neutered, microchipped and vaccinated. His markings are quite striking.  He is available for adoption. He will need some training but if you are up for it, Juan would be quite the addition to your home.\n\nName: Juan\nSpecies: Canine/ Pitbull\nGender: Male/Neutered\nBirthday: 05/15/20\nCurrent Location: The Animal Hospital & Pet Resort at Southwood\nMinimum Adoption Donation: $100",

She does work on her place command several days a week and is getting much better at calming down but she will need continued training and an owner excited to work with her.

You can throw the rope and he will excitedly run to it, and wait for you to pick it up and throw it again; he has his foster momma well trained.\nHe doesn't mind cats and other dogs. With his high energy he would be a better fit for a family with older kids or teens. He attaches to people quickly.\nMost of all he deserves to be spoiled.\n\nFor more information email us at DogDaysRescue@gmail.com or visit https://petstablished.com/public/search/pet/332149\n\nAdoption fee $100",

            "description": "Meet Mystery! The name fits because no one knows her exact age or breed, but we can say that she's about eleven years old, 13 lbs and some type of Terrier mix, and a full-bred heart melter! Mystery is probably also part dragon since she has these cute wispy mouth whiskers and a puffy snoot. Her dragon powers include mind-controlling her humans to cuddle and give her unlimited treats! She's definitely earned those treats, because even at eleven, she has already learned new tricks like walking on a leash, how to sit, high five, and beg. Her favorite activity is snuggling up with her blanket and special human on the couch to binge your favorite Netflix series until you both fall asleep. She's super gentle and loves kids, other dogs, and cats. We promise you will fall in love with this sweet girl!\n\nOne this to know about Mystery is that has seizures and needs medication for it. But it's very easy to manage - just two pills a day, that she'll gladly gobble up with her breakfast and dinner. But the doctor prescribed one more thing: a bunch of love! She's such a sweet love bug and would need a home willing to take their time to get to know her. She's quite shy, since in her earlier years she was found as a stray, but with enough love and patience (and maybe a few extra treats) she'll gladly call you her favorite hooman.\n\nDo you want to be Mystery's forever home and give her all the love she deserves? Put your application in today!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet checkClick here to watch a video of Mystery.",

Well look no further, our girl RAYNA is your match! She would love a home with a yard to play fetch in! An experienced adopter and a home with teens-and-up would be a great match for this sweet lady!\n\nBefore you can adopt, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org/dog-adoption-application! Once your application is approved, you will be able to call to schedule an appointment. If you have any questions, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand that we cannot hold any pets. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nRayna is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Rayna, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

Hes an adorable 6 month old Aussie mix weighing in at 34 lbs. He loves playing with his little 10 lb foster sibling (4 months old) and also gets along with his much larger, older, and lazier foster sibling (6 year old Great Dane). He loves people, chew toys, and plays fetch with pretty much anything. He knows basic commands (sit, come, shake and is working on stay, down and off). He does pretty well on a leash but could still use some more practice. He prefers sleeping with his humans and has not had an accident during the night. He knows to take care of business outside during the day. He will go into the crate when we need to go out for short periods of time, but dont think its his favorite place. \n\nHaku is full of energy and loves attention from anyone. He has no issues with sharing food or toys. He is a little timid with unfamiliar sounds and strange places but adjusts pretty quickly.\n \nHaku would thrive in an active home ideally with another dog or two and will be a wonderful new member of the family. He hasnt been observed with kids, so I cant be 100% sure, but I think he will love them. He hasnt any exposure to cats so thats a complete unknown.",

Flopping on my back for tummy rubs is the best, too! Oh, and playing outside! And playing with toys! Actually, just about anything is the best, cause everything is awesome.\n\nI get along great with other dogs, and have been really good with all of my foster siblings who range from 15 to 65 pounds. Ive never met a cat, so I dont know about them. Kids sound pretty cool though! Overall, Im just pretty easy going and love to play with anyone and anything. Im almost 18 tall at the shoulder and weigh almost 30 pounds. Im working on potty training. I do pretty well in my crate at night, especially if I can be near my family and get some snuggles before I get tucked in. Im also getting good at sit! Will you be my forever home?",

It's hard to tell his history, but he is the sweetest, most playful dog you'll ever meet, and he loves kids, and other dogs. Bruno is still cautious with kittys, but is so sweet, we're sure he'll warm up right away! He is a super intelligent doggy who just wants to lay on you. He's housebroken, and can sleep in a kennel, but is trustworthy enough for free range.\n\nWe hope you'll become his fur-ever people!",

This wee lady is beyond adorable, super smart, curious, playful, and snuggly.\n\nAt roughly 15 weeks on 1/20, she weighed in at 18.5lbs. Shes definitely put on a couple pounds since joining her foster family. Shes doing great with potty training, pretty consistently going outside if the door is open or on puppy pads if not. She knows sit, no, treat, and food, for sure. And she has not been exposed to children or cats.\n\nBrle loves treats, toys, exploring, being outside, all people and dogs shes been exposed to, watching the wild turkeys, wrestling with her youngest canine foster brother, giving kisses, and stealing her fosters slippers to snuggle with.\n\nShe does NOT like being alone. Brle is a social creature. She is very attached to her foster and canine foster siblings. When contained in a crate or behind a doggie door she will cry constantly. If crated within eyesight of her foster human, however, shes perfectly fine and quiet.\n\nAs such, her foster feels very strongly that shed do best in a home both with another dog and with at least one human who is home the majority of the time (long-term, NOT just during COVID).\n\nAdditionally, this wee lady is going to be athletic and fairly high energya prime adventure buddy. Her foster would definitely not recommend a sedentary home. Her brief forays on leash around her fosters property indicate that Brle will be an excellent hiking companion or trail running friend once shes old enough. \n\nAs a husky mix, she can certainly be vocal, but really only when joining the pack in excitement over a deer sighting or a FedEx deliveryand when left alone/confined alone. Otherwise shes not much of a barker. She is a loud sleeper though! Lots of snores and interactive dreaming. Its very cute.\n\nWhomever adopts this girl is lucky indeed. The sweetness is overwhelming.",

Heartworm is not contagious. The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n \n\nWe are excited to introduce everyone to WEBSTER! \n\nWebster is a neutered 6 year old ish Boxer Bully X that is a total love bug! He is currently living with older kids & 3 fur brothers. He fit right in at our house & gets along pretty well with everyone! Not sure about cats, but he hasnt paid much attention to the bunnies we occasionally see in the yard. \n\nWebby is a big, goofy boy, but he still needs to put on some weight, which we are diligently working on! He is mostly house trained having just a few accidents at first. After several days with lots of sleep & yummy food , Webster has gotten more & more comfortable with his new, comfy, family lifestyle here in Colorado.\n\nWebster came to DCCR with the many homeless dogs rescued from TX. He is being treated for heart worm (non contagious & DCCR pays for his treatment!). He likes to take short walks & spend LOTS of his time snuggling on a dog bed or soft blanket, so a low to medium activity house would be ideal, especially while hes taking his heart worm medicine. \n\nCan you be the one to give Webster his fur-ever home?!",

Heartworm is NOT contagious. The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n \n\nRose Wilson or Rosie as I call her is a fun loving, high energy gal. She loves to run and play with my dogs. She is very bouncy as she runs. We are working on no jumping, especially since she is pretty strong. She is also learning boundaries. She loves being pet and can hardly keep down her excitement when she is happy, but can also relax on the couch. She is crate trained and mostly potty trained. She probably has too much energy for small children but would be a great playmate for older kids. She does seem to be food reactive and should be fed separately from other dogs. She walks well on a leash and would make a great hiking partner. She is heart worm positive and is being treated through dccr. They will cont to treat after adoption. She would love to be a part of a high energy family.",

He is great with other dogs, big or small, and would love a dog buddy to play with and to help him feel more comfortable. Hes fantastic in his crate, and loves to use it as a safe retreat during the day. He has the occasional potty mistake, but for the most part does well. He really enjoys going outside, and loves to zoom with his doggy friends in the yard.\n\nChase is about 21 tall at the shoulder and weighs almost 45 pounds. Unsure on how he would do with cats or kids as he hasnt been around either. Chase is making strides every day at being braver; he just needs a home with a patient family who can help him realize the world can be a pretty cool place!",

            "description": "1220086\n\nI need a single family home since I seem to be part pittie! I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions. \n\nHi my name is Ferra. I am a rambunctious 5 month old mix. My foster mom thinks I might be a pitbull or boxer, she says just look at that block head! And she says I have the cutest head wrinkles too! I like telling my foster mom when something doesnt seem quite right, sometimes when people walk in the room or I see that scary thing called a vacuum I cant help but bark. I enjoy playing tug and keep away with my brother and foster sisters. I can be a little possessive of the toy I am playing with. I like to run around all the furniture. Once I am worn out I like to snuggle up with the big dogs on their beds or the sofa with my foster parents and cuddle. I like tummy and ear rubs but dont like my tail touched too much, my foster mom thinks it got hurt when I was really little. I am learning no bite but since Im a puppy I learn with my mouth and like to chew things. I have my big girl teeth though, so Im almost done teething. I think bones, squeekies and stuffies are awesome! I am house trained and go to the door when I have to potty, the big dogs helped teach me that! I sleep all night in my crate, and dont cry at all. Im a pretty smart girl and learned sit, shake, come and no already. My foster mom whistles at me and it really gets my attention. I sometimes like to stand up on my foster parents legs, but Im learning down. We are working on drop it but I can be a little stubborn sometimes. My foster mom took me for a walk on our street and she said I was such a good girl, it was exciting. I love treats, my foster mom calls them cookies. Oh, and I make the cutest sound when I yawn! I am going to grow up to be a big, strong girl and would love a home where I can run and play, go on adventures and at the end of the day give all my cuddles.",

She is very outgoing and is starting to come out of her shell. Loves to play and roll around in the yard and watching her play in the snow has been very entertaining. She loves to play with her foster brother and three sisters, is very curious. She will also spend hours sleeping in your arms.\n\nShe loves squeaky toys and playing with her foster siblings.\n\nShe is very active and would be good for an active family that will keep her physically and mentally challenged.\n\nShe is working on potty training, she has no food aggressions. She would love to find her forever home.",

The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n \n\nVioleta is truly one of the sweetest girls ever and has melts everyones heart when they meet her! Whoever brings this amazing girl home will be so, so, so lucky. The petite pointer/ lab mix would cuddle with you on the couch all day if allowed. Her tail never stops wagging on walks and shes very serious about having her head down and smelling her path the entire time. She is attached to her humans will be your shadow around the home, get as close to you on the couch as possible, and lovessss to be petted and kissed. Shes gained the nickname snor-lax cause she has the cutest little snore while she naps. Shes also gained some weight since coming in to our house and its obvious getting food wasnt a sure thing before. She was a bit shy at first, but does trust every human shes met right away. Were working on jumping up to say hi, but shes so light, that some dont even notice shes doing it. She is 3 yrs old and definitely a mama before.\n\nShe would be the best addition to a home where people are going to be home and love on her, as she gets sad when her people leave. She doesnt pay much attention to the other dog in our house, but weve seen shes still learning how to truly play with other dogs, especially if they are very rambunctious. We think shed do just fine with another dog, but will just need time to learn how to play nicely, as shes probably use to fending for herself and does like a calm environment where she can relax. \n\nShe quickly learned how to run on a leash, but we dont think shed prefer to do really hard hikes or go camping in the cold. (Shes from Texas so we understand.)\n\nShe is already such a good girl and learning house rules she didnt know when she came in (not to eat other peoples food, how to use a doggy door) and getting so much better at not barking at walkers and to not jump up on the counter even if she smells her food. Shes slept in her crate every night but she would just really really love if she could sleep on the bed or couch.",

            "description": "1220091\n\nI need a single family home since I seem to be part pittie! I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions!\n\nHi my name is Fable. I am an inquisitive 5 month old mix. My foster mom thinks I might be a pitbull or boxer and that I might have been the runt of the litter since Im a lot smaller than my sister Farra, and I learned a little slower. I am a fairly shy boy, and tend to flop over with my tail between my legs when I see new people because I get nervous. I bark at new dogs and can be a little selective, so a slow introduction would be good. I enjoy playing tug and keep away with my sister and foster sisters. I like to run around all the furniture, sometimes when Im feeling brave I will pretend to be a mountain goat on the sofa. Once I am worn out I like to snuggle up with the big dogs on their beds or the sofa with my foster parents and cuddle. I like tummy and ear rubs a lot. I am learning no bite but since Im a puppy I learn with my mouth and like to chew things. When my foster mom says ouch or no bite I give her lots of kisses to say Im sorry. I have my big boy teeth though, so Im almost done teething. I think bones, squeekies and stuffies are awesome! I am house trained and go to the door when I have to potty, the big dogs helped teach me that! I sleep all night in my crate, and dont cry at all. Im a pretty smart boy and learned sit, shake, come and no already. I sometimes like to stand up on my foster parents legs, but Im learning down. We are working on drop it but I can be a little stubborn sometimes. My foster mom took me for a walk on our street and she said I was such a good boy, it was exciting! Now when I see the leash I really want to go explore the world. I love getting treats, my foster mom calls them cookies. I am a super shiny and handsome boy, and would love a home where I can run and play, go on adventures and at the end of the day give all my snuggles and kisses!",

He has skin issues that are going to require ongoing care and special food. He loves his people and always excited to get out and play! He seem to do well with other dogs; we aren't sure about cats. We also would not recommend younger children.  Pottsie is neutered and up to date on all his vaccinations, microchipped and he tested heartworm negative.\n\nWe require a vet reference; and Landlord approval if you rent.\n\nPlease contact one of the volunteers at the shelter or one of the Dog Room coordinators if your interested in adopting this sweet dog. You can reach one of the coordinators at dogs@humanesocietyfc.org. Or give us a call at the shelter. 309-647-5077.\n",

Her mom and siblings were owner surrendered to the shelter when they were just 1 week old. A wonderful foster family took them in and now they are ready to find their forever homes. Though they resemble a Pointer mix due to coloring (it\u2019s just a best guess) mom we were told is a schnauzer/terrier mix around 25lbs. She has been around other dogs, kids (age 13-2) and a cat. She\u2019s working on basic puppy manners and is doing very well. She will need someone home most of the time so she can continue her potty training and socialization skills. If your gone more then a few hours, please consider an adult. Are you her forever home?

We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.

Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7.

Freddie is people-oriented and very trainable. He will make you laugh and feel good and fill your Life with Joy. As an adult we foresee he will present a commanding presence!\n<br>\nFreddy and his siblings were born around December 9th to a smaller-sized (approx 40-45 lbs) Labrador Retriever mix mother and a Catahoula father. The puppies were left behind when their elderly owner was hospitalized. His granddaughter rescued the puppies to find them good homes. Freddy came to us in a good condition. He received his first set of puppy vaccinations and dewormer. On 01/29, Freddy weighed 8.2-lbs.\n<br>\nFreddy is looking for his Fur-ever home - Is That YOU?   \nEMAIL us for more information about the adoption process and to SCHEDULE a time to meet this Handsome Boy!\nThank you for seeking to adopt a rescued dog! :)\n\n",

Tammy is an adorable Shepherd/Lab mix with a dark coat and adorable up-ears. Tammy is a senior gal who we suspect is about 9-10 years old. Tammy is a big gal as well- weighing in at 94 pounds! This sweet lady wants nothing more than to be right by your side. She is very loving and will lean her whole body against you for pets and snuggles. Tammy is very snuggly and loves being up next to you on the couch or curled up on a dog bed at your feet. Tammy is house trained and an easy-going house guest. She rides well in the car too! Tammy knows how to sit and shake and she takes treats very gently. Tammy is looking for a loving retirement home (no apartments, condos or townhomes please) in which to live out her golden years. She would do best in a home with no to other pets and with kids over the age of 10. Tammy loves being with her people and can be very stressed when left alone. She would love a family who is home often and can take her along on car rides so she doesn't have to be left alone. Like most senior dogs, Tammy has some arthritis and joint discomfort in her hind end so she is currently on joint supplements and medication to help with inflammation. If you think Tammy would be the perfect addition to your family, submit an adoption application for her today! \n\nIf you're interested in adopting Tammy, please email a completed adoption application to adoptions@kitsap-humane.org. Adoption applications and more information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.kitsap-humane.org/adopt/how-to-adopt/. Once your application has been received, you will be placed in line to have your application reviewed. All applicants are pre-screened over the phone, and then are scheduled for a time to come in and meet the dog at the shelter.\n Primary Color: Brown Weight: 81.2lbs Age: 9yrs 2mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

She has lived with children in the past and done well with them, but due to her shy nature we feel that she should be placed with kids 15+. \n\nBuddy is selective with other dogs, she does well with calm companions. \nBuddy has previously lived with cats, and it can be managed. She will chase cats, but has not hurt any in the past. \n\nBuddy can be a vocal girl, and would do best in a house rather than an apartment. \n\nWe always recommend crate training, exercise, playtime, and a regular schedule for potty breaks when bringing a new dog into your home. The shelter environment is much different than your home, so expect the unexpected. We do our best to help find the right pet for you, but your new dog may act differently on your turf than he/she did on ours. Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient and enjoy this new and exciting time!\nIncluded in the adoption fee are rabies (if applicable) & distemper vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, spay or neuter surgery.",

            "description": "Diamond is a 2 year old pittie mix looking for a calm, mature family. She has been shuffled around from home to home, and needs someone experienced, patient, and willing to give her a stable and steady routine. She does take a little bit to warm up to new people, but once she knows you, she is very loving and cuddly. She is very loyal, and once comfortable, will be protective of her people and home.\n\nDiamond's ideal home will NOT include any children, animals, or a high volume of visitors. When properly introduced, she can do well with new people, but should not be subjected to strangers continually coming and going. She will need a quiet, adult only home, a fenced in yard, plenty of chew toys (to keep her mind busy), and most importantly, patience and understanding. \n\nShe is easily excitable, and does not know how to handle her excitement, which can result in her becoming mouthy. Her foster parents have been working with her to find ways to calm her when she does become excited, and Diamond has been doing GREAT! She really enjoys games that involve working for food/treats (such as hiding food, or freezing in Kongs), and would love her forever home to continue doing those things for her!\n\nShe is crate trained, potty trained, and knows sit, and shake. She would benefit from continuing her learning, and using her brain to advance her skills.\n\nInterested? Great! Submit an application at www.caninecastawaysrescue.org. The application approval process can take up to 7 business days. Once approved, we will contact you for the highly anticipated meet and greet.\n\nNot ready to commit to being a full time fur mommy or daddy? You can apply to foster! Just fill out the foster application on our website, and be very thorough so we can match you with a great fit for you and your home!",

Camille is good with other dogs but it is unknown about cats. She does have some excitement when greeting her person and will sometimes jump on you, so a house with young kids may not be ideal. She is very smart and responds well to training. She is a pleaser and has a very loving soul. She does have some energy, so she will need an owner that is willing to provide her with daily activity.\n\nAdoption donation of $250. All vetting is up to date. Microchipped and spayed. Also on heartworm preventative. Visit\nwww.ruffloverescue.com/adoption\nto make this pup a member of your family.",

Here at the shelter, Winnie has been slowly warming up to staff and other dogs. She is fairly new to the shelter so information is limited other than her enjoying her afternoon walks. Winnie's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Winnie or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

We think she will grow to be 10 to 12 pounds as an adult. A perfect day for Tequila would include a trip to puppy socialization class, a nice walk with her favorite person, and lots of cuddles. Tequila's adoption fee is $400 and she is a SHELTER HERO! Which means 100% of her adoption fee goes towards other animals in the shelter. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Tequila or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the PUPPY'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom.

When I arrived at the shelter I was on the skinny side, but thanks to a good diet, I'm looking so much better. I enjoy going for walks, but I do pull a bit, so a walking harness will be best for me. I appear to do ok with other dogs and would do best in a home with older kids. I am heartworm positive, so my new family will have to bring me back for treatment as an out-patient. This is not contagious to people or other animals. Thanks to Dolly's Dream my adoption fee is sponsored and I get to go home with things needed to help me settle into my new home. Call the shelter at 954-989-3977 ext. 6 for details.",

We think he will grow to be 45 to 55 pounds as an adult. A perfect day for Gunner would include a trip to puppy socialization class, a nice walk with his favorite person, and lots of cuddles. Gunner's adoption fee is $300 and he is a SHELTER HERO! Which means 100% of his adoption fee goes towards other animals in the shelter. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply.

            "description": "Woof, woof! I'm so excited you're thinking about adopting a new fur-ever family member! Here are a few things that may help you with your big decision. First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

The story is that she broke out of her backyard, being protective of her puppies and attacked a person or dog that was walking past her home. OAS does not totally believe this story because there was no report filed or pictures taken against PIPER. OAS could not adopt her out because of this accusation and therefore she needed to go to rescue. \nSince PIPER has been in our care she has been an extremely easy dog to take care of. She is very quiet and crate trained. She is not reactive to the other dogs in our care and handles hanging out with them very well. She can be a bit wild and doing zoomies outside but inside she lives to snuggle. She is very quiet and gentle. PIPER still needs to be spayed before she can be adopted but she is actively looking for her forever home. Her chart from OAS states that she is 8 years old but we will be taking her to the vet soon to confirm this, PIPER seems to be a lot younger than that.",

I'm a high energy guy that would do best with an experienced family that lives an active lifestyle. I may thrive in dog sports like agility, tracking, or rally as a way to work out my energy and help me focus on training. I can be overwhelming for young children so I prefer a household with children that are 8 years or older that have lived with high energy dogs like me before. If there are dogs in the home, they should be tolerant of my outgoing personality and ideally be around my size. Please be sure to bring in the entire household, including any resident dogs, to meet me before I officially join your family.\nIf you are interested in meeting with me, please submit your fully completed Adoption Profile Form to adoptinquire@peninsulahumanesociety.org and an adoption counselor will call you to conduct a phone interview before making an appointment to meet in person. You must be 18 or older to submit an application. Please make sure to include in the application that you are interested in meeting me, Bernard ID# A888788.\nApplication: https://phs-spca.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AdoptionProfiles_dog.pdfUnless otherwise indicated, adoptable animals are located at our Lantos Center for Compassion at 1450 Rollins Road, Burlingame, CA 94010. Please note at this time we are doing adoptions by appointments only. Please call us at 650-340-7022 to schedule an appointment.Our hours are weekdays from 11am-6pm and weekends from 11am-5pm (closed major holidays). Interested adopters must arrive at least 1 hour before close. We do our best to update our listings regularly, but we can't guarantee every animal you see is still available. It's also typical for us to have animals who haven't had their photos taken yet, so you are welcome to visit our adoption center and have a look around!\nTo check on an animal's adoption status, please call 650-340-7022 during normal business hours to speak with an adoption counselor. Emails will be returned as soon as possible, but please allow up to 48 hours during busy adoption periods like weekends.",

They get along very well and would love a home together but they also do okay apart. She has done well with kids in the past as long as they can handle her excitement. She is very praise motivated and loves to make her people happy. \n\nIf interested in adopting Sza, please submit an online adoption application! Her adoption fee is $400. Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment. Once we receive and review your application, we will contact you to schedule an appointment. Thank you!",

            "description": "***PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO & ADOPTION CRITERIA BEFORE CONTACTING ODR OR APPLYING FOR ADOPTION, THANKS!***\n\n\nMEET Mondo -\n\nMondo is a 14 month old, short hair black & tan, 16 lb tweenie puppy.  Would consider placing with a sweet, gentle, younger, small non-alpha female dachshund (no male dogs), but no cats and please no kids (he is frightened of children). He's a typical happy go lucky doxie pup, loves to play, and is currently working on leash training. Mondo is a super handsome dachshund, very good breeding, just a happy/heathy little lad! Doxie saavy only please apply. Adoption fee: $595.\n\nMondo will do best in a family with a stay at home parent (work from home or retired) and only older children (over age 12), who are familiar with the special needs of Dachshunds.\n\nLike all Dachshunds, Mondo is high energy and enjoys playing and warming his little bones in the sunshine, so along with regular walks around his neighborhood, Mondo needs a secure fenced yard to run around and explore safely. While small in stature, doxies are big on personality and don't generally do well in apartments, with all of the noises and traffic that come with multiple dwellings in a confined space.  To best set up our doxies and their new families for success, ODR, Inc., adopt to families who live in single family homes with secure fenced yards.\n\nOUR CRITERIA (aka The Fine Print):\n\nBased on 30 years of experience with rescue doxies, we have pretty strict criteria. Do you work from home/stay at home/work part time?  Have a securely fenced yard? We do not place same gender dogs in a home unless they were raised together, and children need to be 12 or older (some exceptions IF the dog is a puppy or the child has been raised with a doxie). We prefer non smokers and a home with no other small animals (ferrets, hamsters, etc). Cats are on a case by case basis depending on the dog. Remember, these are rescues; many were surrendered because of these issues. \n\nWHAT YOU GET IN RETURN WITH YOUR LITTLE RESCUE:\n\nAll our dogs are fully vetted, including spay/neuter, rabies, DHPP, Bordetella, Pyrantyl, nails trimmed, and dental when needed. They'll come with a basket of goodies, food, toys and a custom made harness. The adoption fee is $595, sorry no exceptions, as this covers the cost to rescue them, vet them and take care of them while in our rescue. It also helps towards the care of other doxies that come with huge vet or dental bills or need extensive behavioral training.\n\nCan you give Mondo a happy, carefree life again? If interested, please complete the adoption questionnaire at www.odr-inc.org and email it to: jrangan@comcast.net \nThe adoption committee will attempt to be in contact with you within 48-72 hours. Please be patient as we are solely volunteer run.",

Dallas is completely housebroken and settling into his new foster home. He is great meeting new people, but has never been around young children. Dallas is unknown with cats or other dogs. He loves going for car rides and thinks he is a lap dog. Dallas would do best with a secure, fenced yard in his new home. He needs an adopter who will provide a lot of exercise and structure for this young boy.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an online application first at www.adoptaboxerrescue.com.  Then e-mail the contacts below.  Be sure to include your full name, city, state, and area code in the subject line of your message. \n \nEmail the Boxer Rescue Contact Below:\nAdopt A Boxer Rescue\n\nJen Kallenborn - valantar@yahoo.com",

            "description": "TUG was owner surrendered to us at no fault of his own. TUG (from what we were told) lived with another female dog or several years. Him and the other female dog got in fights a couple time over food. His owners then began feeding them separately. Until one day they decided that feeding them separately was too much work. TUG and the other female dog then got in to another fight (there is a photo of what he looked like after coming out of the vet) and his owners took him to the vet to be euthanized. The vet did not feel comfortable putting TUG to sleep so they reached out to rescue for help. We then stepped up to save TUG's life. Since TUG has been in our care he has shown no aggression towards other dogs. We do feed our dogs separately, as most dogs should be but he is crated in a room full of other dogs where he eats with them and I have seen absolutely no negative reaction towards any other dog from him. He is a very sweet old man. While he is older, his spirit is very young and playful. He does the cutest spins when coming in and out of his crate or when its food time. He is currently being fostered in San Jose, CA and his foster says he is extremely easy and sweet to have in her home. When she has people come to her home, he gently greets them and then goes back to his bed to lay down. TUG would be a great addition to any home. He did previously live with young children but we have no idea how his interactions were with those children.",

Her foster has nothing but great stuff to say about her, she'd do great with young playful dogs or very active people. I think she will be a very athletic pup as she grows! She would make a great mountain - hiking pup.  She is very smart and quick to learn. She is super snuggly and loves attention. I think she'd be ok with children, but she does jump and is teething so no human, dog or toy is safe! Joking but kind of serious haha! She does well with bully sticks or antlers to keep her attention away from non-suitable chews.  She is still working on potty training. She generally goes potty outside but maybe once a day uses the potty pad. Overall she is just super sweet and loves to love!!  She is hoping there is an adventurous family out there for her to grow and thrive in - if you would like to meet Libby please fill out an application at\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nLibby\u2019s adoption fee is $375.00 - she is spayed, up to date on all her vaccinations and chipped.\n",

This sweetheart has a friendly, gentle natured demeanor, and is guaranteed to bring a smile to anyone who has the pleasure of meeting her. Saisha has previously lived with young children, and does very well in an active family home. \n\nSaisha is a bright, engaging dog who is well mannered, and with her moderate energy level, will be a great companion to just about any family. She enjoys the company of other dogs, and would love to have a playmate or two in her next home. Saisha knows how to play fetch with her toys, and enjoys romping around the yard each day. \n\nSaisha is house broken, and is already crate trained. She has wonderful house manners, and sleeps on a dog bed quietly through the night. She takes treats gently, and is overall a wonderful, well mannered pet. If Saisha sounds like the right fit for your household, schedule an adoption appointment today!",

She has most likely never lived in a home and needs help being shown what it's like to live in a home. She will need structure as she acclimates to her new environment. This includes being housebroken and basic training. She is a very sweet girl and loves, loves people. However, she can be jumpy for affection and needs to be shown what is expected of her in a home. We know sweet Carol will thrive in a home if you give her a chance. She has had pups in the past, and she will be spayed and UTD on all vaccinations before she goes home. If you can give this sweet girl a forever home with guidance, love and structure to help her blossom into the great dog we know she is, fill out the online application and call the shelter at 609-265-5073 ex 4, to schedule a meet and get ready to fall in love with Carol.",

            "description": "Trapezium was surrendered to Stockton Animal Services by her owner along with 9 siblings and her mother. The family was transferred to Valley Humane on 12/31. Trapezium weighs 14.4 pounds.\n\nTrapezium will be available for adoption on Tuesday 2/2. Approved applicants will have the opportunity to meet the litter and choose their puppy. The first approved adopter will have choice of 10, the second will have choice of 9, etc. These puppies are not available to adopt in pairs.\n\nThe puppies appear to be a mix of working breeds. Mom appears to be a German Shepherd Dog mix (weighing 67#). The puppies are active and friendly. They are prone to nipping and herding and will benefit from puppy socialization classes.\n\nDuring shelter-in-place, Valley Humane is conducting adoptions by appointment only. If you would like to adopt Trapezium or a littermate, please complete an Adoption Inquiry Form (copy and paste the following URL into your browser), https://valleyhumane.org/adoption/adoption-inquiry-form/\n\nAn adoption counselor will reach out via telephone to conduct an adoption interview. Once you have submitted your application, stand by to answer our call! Applicants will be interviewed on Saturday 1/30 or Monday 2/1.\n\nIf approved, we will schedule an adoption appointment for you and your family at our facility in Pleasanton on Tuesday 2/2.\n\nhttps://valleyhumane.org/safe-adoption-guidelines/",

            "description": "*Needs another young confident dog* Needs a yard*Meet Tobias - the most gentle, mellow, and loving soul you will ever meet! He is a stunning one-year-old Spaniel/Pointer mix weighing about 25 lbs. He was recently found as a stray but now is living in a loving foster home. He is so well mannered at home and does great with everyone and everything. He wins over the hearts of everyone he meets with his gentle touch and laying his head down in your hands. Tobias constantly makes his foster family laugh with his giddy attitude while prancing around and wagging his tail (well really his whole bottom wiggles). He loves to be your shadow and will follow you around the house and will always lay next to your feet or curl up right beside you. Tobias loves the mornings and does the cutest happy dance when he sees his people are awake and it's time for a walk. He is happiest when with his person or other playful dogs, adores going on walks, and is absolutely the most easy-going dog we have ever met.\n\nTobias loves all humans, and although hasn't met young kids yet we think with proper supervision he would be great with them too due to his easy-going and mellow nature. With a slow introduction, Tobias does great with other dogs and once comfortable then wants to non-stop play. He has been living with two cats and does well with them too, only trying to play with them. He is now figuring out how to play with toys, and being reinforced with his house potty-training (and doing really well at it!).\n\nTobias' ideal home would have another playful/confident dog for him to follow and play with. It would also be great for his caretaker to be home often and/or work from home (even after the pandemic) as he loves to be by your side as much as he can. A home with a yard is preferred for him too, so that he has space to play with his new dog friend. Want to be his forever family?

I love to run so short walks will help melt the extra 'lbs' away.  I'm about 25 lbs and should be 12-15 at the most.  My spirit and personality make up for my heaviness.  I get along with all the dogs at rescue and I'm mostly a quiet little girl.  My foster mom had my blood profile right away with the thought there might be something wrong, but it checked out perfectly, so a diet for me.  I don't need a large yard, but I do like to go outside and sniff around.  Walks would be perfect.  I know I'm a snuggle bug because when people come near me I lean into them and almost purr with delight.  I'll be getting my teeth cleaned in the next month.  If it's  lovingness your looking for look no further, I'm your girl!",

Cute as can be, just adorable with a very sweet disposition. Will consider placing with a gentle non-alpha male dachshund, but no kids and no cats. She loves her toys and likes to dress up. This is one special girl that loves her walks, but also loves to cuddle at movie time! Doxie savvy only please apply. If you want to adopt sweet Tootsie please fill out an application today! \n\nTootsie will do best in a family with a stay at home parent (work from home or retired) and only older children (over age 12), who are familiar with the special needs of Dachshunds.\n\nLike all Dachshunds, Tootsie is high energy and enjoys playing and warming her little bones in the sunshine, so along with regular walks around her neighborhood, Tootsie needs a secure fenced yard to run around and explore safely. While small in stature, doxies are big on personality and don't generally do well in apartments, with all of the noises and traffic that come with multiple dwellings in a confined space. To best set up our doxies and their new families for success, ODR, Inc., adopt to families who live in single family homes with secure fenced yards.\n\nOUR CRITERIA (aka The Fine Print):\n\nBased on 30 years of experience with rescue doxies, we have pretty strict criteria. Do you work from home/stay at home/work part time? Have a securely fenced yard? We do not place same gender dogs in a home unless they were raised together, and children need to be 12 or older (some exceptions IF the dog is a puppy or the child has been raised with a doxie). We prefer non smokers and a home with no other small animals (ferrets, hamsters, etc). Cats are on a case by case basis depending on the dog. Remember, these are rescues; many were surrendered because of these issues. \n\nWHAT YOU GET IN RETURN WITH YOUR LITTLE RESCUE:\n\nAll our dogs are fully vetted, including spay/neuter, rabies, DHPP, Bordetella, Pyrantyl, nails trimmed, and dental when needed. They'll come with a basket of goodies, food, toys and a custom made harness. The adoption fee is $495, sorry no exceptions, as this covers the cost to rescue them, vet them and take care of them while in our rescue.  It also helps towards the care of other doxies that come with huge vet or dental bills or need extensive behavioral training.\n\nCan you give Tootsie a happy, carefree life that she deserves?   If interested, please complete the adoption questionnaire at www.odr-inc.org and email it to:  jrangan@comcast.net.  The adoption committee will attempt to be in touch with you within 48 -72 hours. Please be patient as we are solely volunteer run.",

            "description": "We have a litter of 4 purebred Jack Russell Terriers for adoption. They were born on 12/2 . We rescued them from a backyard breeder who had them outside. They were laying on some cedar shavings in a shed with no heat, no blanket or anything. They were freezing. At first, we took a doghouse out there with blankets as the breeder/owner refused to let them inside. However, they started to get a rash and irritated skin on parts of their body (we suspect from the cedar chips) and they just looked miserable. The temperature at night was supposed to get down to 12 degrees , and we feared they would not survive another night of freezing temperatures, therefore, we ended up making an offer and buying the litter so we could get them medical attention, vaccinations, and find them wonderful homes. They are now safe in a warm home and bed, their rashes are healing, they are healthy puppies.\n\nMom is a 12-pound JRT and dad is 15 pounds. These cute little puppies are called Shorty Jacks because they have the short legs and longer body. The breeder docked the tails on 3 of them and one was born with no tail. They have had their first vaccines, have been dewormed, and microchipped. They are loveable and playful puppies, all of them. We have 4 females. They are also litter box trained. \n\nWe require a fenced in back yard (physical fence) and our policy is no small children under the age of 7. Puppies needs a home where a primary adult caretaker is home during the day. If you have other dogs, another small dog 15 pounds and under in the home is acceptable, however no large dogs. \n\nAdoption fee is $425. They will be spayed before adoption, and they will be ready to leave on 2/14\n\nPlease put in an application on our website www.indianasaveadog.com A $50 deposit (once your application is approved) will hold your puppy until adoption day.",

They were laying on some cedar shavings in a shed with no heat, no blanket or anything. They were freezing. At first, we took a doghouse out there with blankets as the breeder/owner refused to let them inside. However, they started to get a rash and irritated skin on parts of their body (we suspect from the cedar chips) and they just looked miserable. The temperature at night was supposed to get down to 12 degrees , and we feared they would not survive another night of freezing temperatures, therefore, we ended up making an offer and buying the litter so we could get them medical attention, vaccinations, and find them wonderful homes. They are now safe in a warm home and bed, their rashes are healing, they are healthy puppies.\n\nMom is a 12-pound JRT and dad is 15 pounds. These cute little puppies are called Shorty Jacks because they have the short legs and longer body. The breeder docked the tails on 3 of them and one was born with no tail. They have had their first vaccines, have been dewormed, and microchipped. They are loveable and playful puppies, all of them. We have 4 females. They are also litter box trained. \n\nWe require a fenced in back yard (physical fence) and our policy is no small children under the age of 7. Puppies needs a home where a primary adult caretaker is home during the day. If you have other dogs, another small dog 15 pounds and under in the home is acceptable, however no large dogs. \n\nAdoption fee is $425. They will be spayed before adoption, and they will be ready to leave on 2/14\n\nPlease put in an application on our website www.indianasaveadog.com A $50 deposit (once your application is approved) will hold your puppy until adoption day.",

            "description": "We have a litter of 4 purebred Jack Russell Terriers for adoption. They were born on 12/2 . We rescued them from a backyard breeder who had them outside. They were laying on some cedar shavings in a shed with no heat, no blanket or anything. They were freezing. At first, we took a doghouse out there with blankets as the breeder/owner refused to let them inside. However, they started to get a rash and irritated skin on parts of their body (we suspect from the cedar chips) and they just looked miserable. The temperature at night was supposed to get down to 12 degrees , and we feared they would not survive another night of freezing temperatures, therefore, we ended up making an offer and buying the litter so we could get them medical attention, vaccinations, and find them wonderful homes. They are now safe in a warm home and bed, their rashes are healing, they are healthy puppies.\n\nMom is a 12-pound JRT and dad is 15 pounds. These cute little puppies are called Shorty Jacks because they have the short legs and longer body. The breeder docked the tails on 3 of them and one was born with no tail. They have had their first vaccines, have been dewormed, and microchipped. They are loveable and playful puppies, all of them. We have 4 females. They are also litter box trained. \n\nWe require a fenced in back yard (physical fence) and our policy is no small children under the age of 7. Puppies needs a home where a primary adult caretaker is home during the day. If you have other dogs, another small dog 15 pounds and under in the home is acceptable, however no large dogs. \n\nAdoption fee is $425. They will be spayed before adoption, and they will be ready to leave on 2/14\n\nPlease put in an application on our website www.indianasaveadog.com A $50 deposit (once your application is approved) will hold your puppy until adoption day.",

He gets along great with all the dogs on the ranch but he would also do perfectly fine living as the only dog in the home too. He does need a home with a yard (and preferably a doggy door). Zeke is house trained. He is super smart and quick as a whip - he would love someone who will teach him new things. He's just a ball of fun and love and is so ready to fill your home and heart with his amazing companionship.\n\nAvailable to ADOPT OR FOSTER\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nIf interested in FOSTERING, please fill out an foster application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/foster\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information about Zeke, please contact Kathy:\nCall/Text: (951) 515-4077\nEmail: k.haley.hope.ranch@gmail.com",

            "description": "MEET GIZELLE!!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A3840415.\n\nBeautiful Gizelle was an owner surrender to the shelter and she is not handling shelter life well. She is so confused and doesn't understand why she isn't in her home anymore. Her previous owners stated that Gizelle loves her people once she gets to know them. She loves squeaky/stuffed toys and loved to sleep with her owners in their bed at night.\n\nNow she just doesn't know where she is. She is scared and skittish when the shelter staff comes to take her out of her kennel. She is getting better with leash training and will even go for a short walk with the staff. She liked doing \"zoomies\" in the yard. She tolerates petting but doesn't seek attention. She is losing weight at the shelter and needs to get out soon.\n\nGizelle needs an adopter that understands she is going to need time and patience to get used to new people and a new home. She needs to be in a home where she is the only dog and any children should be 12+ years old. If you think you can give this big, beautiful girl the home she needs, please come and meet her today!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

I was found as a stray. They tell me I must have been a house beagle because I am potty trained, but that does not at all stop me from beagling when outside. I love outside. I am looking for a home with a fenced yard so I can go out and do my beagling without getting lost again. I am around 2 years old and weight approximately 30 llbs. I am good with other dogs, but I do not know about cats. If you are looking for a handsome brown eyed boy like me please fill out an online application.\nIf interested, you can easily fill out an adoption application by clicking here: adoption application\nFor anyone viewing this on Petfinder, if you are interested in adopting this animal you will need to go to our website www.rosesrescue.net to fill out the online adoption application.

Can you imagine a good looking fellow like me being a stray.  I wasn't neutered, perhaps I was being used for breeding since I'm an unusual fellow, Red Merle Long Haired Chihuahua.  I'm fine with other dogs and suspect I would be fine with cats.  I'm quiet and gentle.  My dream home would be  stay at home parents or work from home parents,  a small fenced in yard and a warm bed to snooze in.  As you can see I got a hair cut, really short, but when I grow out I've got a flowing white coat with a touch of red merle.  I'm all ready for my forever home!",

Scamp would do well in a home with another dog playmate or a human with a lot of attention to give.\nHe enjoys being cuddled, playing with other dogs, and running away from cats.\nScamp's adoption fee is $300. This goes toward helping more animals in need.\nHe will be neutered on the 22nd of February , up to date on his vaccines and microchipped.\nIf you feel like you can give Scamp a wonderful home , you can fill out an application at\nfurfriends4life.org/adoptionaplication/\nAny further questions feel free to call/text 661-431-4607\nOr email at\nfurfriends4liferescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Did someone say the word \"play?\" \n\nBecause Chance heard it. \n\nThis active Boxer mix is around 2 years old and loves to have fun. He enjoys running around a yard with his foster brother who is a smaller dog, or bringing toys to you in the house to play fetch. (He's still confused why he has to let the toys go before they can be thrown again though.)\n\nChance is new to the leash and would need some guidance and patience to learn to walk on it without pulling. Fortunately he thrives on praise and loves food treats so teaching him commands hasn't been too difficult so far.\n\nChance is extremely people friendly and will beg for ear scratches after meeting someone for more than 5 minutes. While he gets along well with dogs, he will give an alert bark if he sees an unfamiliar dog nearby. He has not been tested with cats.\n\nHe is house trained and crate trained, though he does take a bit longer to settle down if he doesn't have a crated canine friend nearby. \n\nChance is UTD on shots, preventative, micro-chipped, and neutered!\n\nChance 's adoption fee is $250, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nIf interested in meeting Chance you must fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nChance and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption through rescue for your new family companion!",

She is a beautiful girl with big sweet eyes who loves everyone she meets. Jill is a true pack dog, like most beagles, and would do best in a home with another dog and a fenced yard. She is very submissive with other dogs (and people) and loves to spend time cuddled up with her foster dog siblings or running around the yard with them. If it were up to Jill she\u2019d also ALWAYS have a toy in her mouth. She adores stuffed toys and makes the cutest high pitched squeal when you give her one. Jill is almost potty trained but does still have an occasional accident in the house. She also has beagle energy and would do best with someone who will have the time to train her and give her lots of play and walk time. Jill is also crate trained when her foster family leaves the house and likes to sleep curled up next to her humans at night. \n\nHeart-worm negative, current on vaccines.  If not already spayed/neutered - it is included in adoption fee.\n\n\n",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO ADOPT, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY VIA PETFINDER, INSTEAD GO TO  www.arizonapoodlerescue.org TO THE \u201cAdopt Me\u201d SECTION TO FIND OUR ONLINE APPLICATION.  WE WILL NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS OUT OF STATE.   PLEASE RESPECT OUR PROCESS AND OUR TIME AS WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DOG ONCE WE HAVE AN APPLICATION IN HAND.  PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS! \n\nMonte is a 1-2 year old Chihuahua mixed with maybe Rat Terrier. He weighs about 12 lbs.  He is a fun wild child once you get to know him and he you.  He is shy with new people and would benefit from having a dog savvy Mom or Dad that will continue our work socializing him and make him feel safe with all humans. He will also need help encouraging him to continue in his housebreaking. On the fun side - he is a player.  He loves other playful dogs and will keep any young resident dog moving a lot of the day.  He is a ball dog.   Then he sleeps like a baby right next to them as the picture shows.  He will snuggle with his human too.  Monte can run like the wind is not much of a barker unless a stranger comes into his space.  Monte is a good little boy, would make a great addition to a family with adults and older children.  He might be fearful of loud active younger children.\n\nThere is an application and possible home visit or reference check prior to adoption.   Applications can be found on our website www.arizonapoodlerescue.org.   Click on the \"Adopt Me\" tab.    Monte is being fostered in Chandler.  His adoption fee is $200.\n\nArizona Poodle Rescue is an all volunteer non-profit organization.  We do not have a shelter.  Our dogs are currently being fostered in private homes generally located in the Phoenix and Tucson area.",

            "description": "Snoopy is seriously the best. He is like 80lbs of pure mush baby! He is still a young thing, too, so he may grow! But he actually will likely lose weight since he came to us slightly out of shape. Lots of jelly rolls!\nWe rescued Snoopy from The Anticruelty Society downtown and we are thrilled that we did. He was surrendered because his owner fell on hard times. \nSnoopy has more of a lab personality. He is congenial, friendly, waggy, and very calm in the car- a real pro!\n\nSnoopy enjoyed his time in play group off-leash meeting a dozen dogs! His videos should be posted in this profile! He was the life of the party. He was the same with dogs as he is with humans, happy to see all!\nHe is just a super friendly, super happy, and lovely amazing dog. Can't say enough!\n\nSnoopy has been in a foster home with a single girl in her apartment in the city and this is what she has to say about him:\n\n\"Snoopy aka Pike loves snuggles on the couch, your personal space, all toys and bones, and long walks around the park. He's a super social guy and loves to be around people. What he does not like is not being allowed on the couch, loud noises, people taking his toys away!\n\nHe is housebroken and he is getting there with the crate training. We are working on it. He had only been crated when I'm in the shower and we just started overnight crating. He whines for about 20 minutes but then settles down. He does fantastic after that, no barking or being destructive. I do give him a bone while he's in there to keep him occupied.\n\nOn walks, he pulls a little and we've been working on that. He's a close walker too. And I trip over him most of the time! When we cross paths with other dogs he's mostly just curious but never barks or lunges. He likes other dogs and people for sure. \n\nPike is puppy-like with his toys. He loves anything he can chew! He's been great with flavored bones that are edible. With his plastic toys and stuffed toys you have to watch him because he rips whatever he can get off. He's destroyed stuffed toys and plastic toys but is great with ropes!\n\nThe important thing to know about Pike is that he is an excited nipper like a mouthy young pup, he doesn't mean anything by it except that he is happy, and he stops quickly, but would not be ideal for young kids. Once he calms down he's great. \nHe also guards his toys. He's fine if you take his food away but don't touch the toys! He's easily distracted though with a treat and we've been working on fetch with sit and he drops the toy so he doesn't get snippy. A treat trade is key with this guy, and he has never gotten mean but we don't push it, I respect his choices and work around them by not pulling things out f his mouth and instead offering him a treat so that he drops his toy, which he does.\n\nOverall, this guy is the sweetest! He's a bit tubby but there's more of him to love. He has been adjusting great to his new environment and just wants to cuddle. He's very curious in a puppy way. He loves to meet new people and has loved everyone he's met so far. He even gets compliments on walks. \n\nWe tried to work on \"no dogs on the couch\", but he wasn't having any part of that! He does respond great to get off the couch though. Ha But I would love to see him in a forever home that will let him up on one because he is not a fan of the floor.\n\nHe loves his treats and will do anything for them. I think he purposely messes tricks up sometimes so he can get double treats! He's got sit and lay down, off the couch, and we've been working on stay, come, and go to your kennel. He's super quiet and whisper barks at you to get your attention. When he does bark, he's got such a deep voice! \n\nHe gets the zoomies in the yard but tries to dig. He even likes to eat sticks. He's not a jumper, he needs a boost getting into my jeep. Not sure if it's because he's tubby, or he doesn't know how. But he does great with the 4' fence. He's not a fan of loud noises, but if they're consistent, he adjusts to them. For example, he doesn't like the construction noise, but learns to ignore the people that live above us. \n\nHe's been great with only chewing his own toys and doesn't try to chew furniture or clothes or shoes. He's easily occupied with a bone that lasts a long time. Otherwise he loses interest in toys unless you're playing. He's a sweet boy who just wants lots of love.\"\n\nWe think Snoopy would be a great companion for a variety of homes given his good nature, we just wouldn't place him with young children. He is really the best boy so we hope you will apply today as his foster mom would love to tell you more!",

His foster mom says he's a bit shy and mostly a lap dog who wants to be adored and cuddled. We are still working on his house training so an adopter will have to be prepared to help him with that along with learning how to walk on a leash. He still hasn't had all of his shots so will need to wait till he does to go on walks. He enjoys toys and playtime with the foster family's young dog. Atlas has a good appetite and he will likely weigh more than 100 pounds when full grown. He will do well with a spacious yard and someone that has experience with large dogs. He is neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccines. If you're interested in Atlas, an application is absolutely required. You can submit an application by clicking on the APPLY FOR ADOPTION button or by pasting the following into your browser.\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/TVAR/Dog\nBecause we expect an outpouring of interest in Atlas, we are not able to respond to numerous inquiries and emails. We are looking for the right match for Atlas given his size and breed and if you don't hear from us within a week, please assume he has been adopted.",

He loves tennis balls and attention, car rides and exercise.  He has not had the opportunity to live in a home before, as his previous owner kept him in a kennel.  He'll learn some house manners in his foster home, and soon be ready for adoption.\n\nJake is fostered in the Little Rock, AR area.  If you are interested in Jake, please apply at www.makrescue.org  Jake's adoption fee is $150 which includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip, and any other vetting incurred while in rescue.\n\n",

            "description": "HI! My name is Fonzi and I am a young Boxer mix, or so my people think. I LOVE kids! I am very smart and am currently mastering \"sit\". Next I will work on \"stay\". Learning is so so so fun. I like treats, they help me learn! I am very attentive and will look to you for direction and instruction. I really like to snuggle in bed at night with my human foster sister and I don't make any messes in her room, either. I am very good at keeping my crate clean when I am in it. My favorite toy are stuffed animals and I am doing really well at not chewing on things that I am not supposed to. I also play well with my foster brother, and he's bigger than me! I promise that I am a good boy and will make a great addition to your family. Fonzi's adoption fee is $400 which covers his neuter, vaccinations appropriate at the time of adoption, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

If you're looking for a hiking partner or running partner, look no further!\n\nRuby has been a support dog for a veteran for the last 9 months. She is very obedient and attentive to whoever she claims as her human. She takes a bit to warm up to new people, and will require several meetings with potential adopters. She has been shuffled around from home to home since a pup, so she just needs some stability.\n\nShe walks well on leash, is crate trained, potty trained, muzzle trained. She needs, and thrives, with structure and routine! She is treat motivated, a quick learner, and is always up for an adventure with her person.\n\nRuby needs a home WITHOUT other animals and kids.  \n\nHer dislikes/triggers: direct eye contact, sharing food/toys, baby talk.\n\nRuby's perfect person would continue working with her on obedience, and keep her on a routine so she can feel confident and secure in her day-to-day. She may need space when she gets overwhelmed, and needs a person willing to give her that. \n\nRuby is a wonderful dog for the right person, and we are determined to find her the right forever home.\n\nInterested? Great! Submit and application at www.caninecastawaysrescue.org. The application approval process can take up to 7 business days. Once approved, we will contact you for that highly anticipated meet and greet.\n\nNot ready to commit to being a full time fur mommy or daddy? You can apply to foster! Just fill out our foster application on our website, and be very thorough so we can match you with a great fit for you and your home!",

Charlie is a 1 yr. old handsome yellow Lab who just loves being outside and hanging out with any canine buddies that he can find.  Charlie came up from the south, and found a wonderful home, but it soon became apparent he needed another canine friend and lots of room to run.  He hated when he was left alone, but was reassured by a canine friend.\n\nSo Charlie is looking for an active couple or person who likes to walk, run, hike, camp, or just be outdoors -  he loves being outside more than in, so the more time he can spend enjoying the outdoors, the happier he is!  He loves other dogs, and gets along with a wide variety of personalities, but would do best with another active dog who enjoys playing.  He is also great on leash!\n\nCharlie would not do well in a busy home with young kids \u2013 the noise and commotion would be too much for him.  He is tentative around new things, and takes time to adjust, so he needs someone who will be patient.  However, once he is comfortable, he will be your best buddy!  Charlie is a sweet boy, who is hoping to find his wonderful forever home!\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  While this Lab may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. \n\nFor more information on this Lab, please contact INFO@BROOKLINELABRESCUE.ORG.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, www.brooklinelabrescue.org, for more information on our adoption process. If you need additional information about the adoption process or whether you are in our coverage area, please send an e-mail to our Rescue at info@brooklinelabrescue.org\n\nEven if you are not ready to adopt, you can still help us help our Labs!\n\nBrookline Labrador Retriever Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit volunteer organization funded entirely by donations.

            "description": "**Louie is currently staying in a foster home. If youd like to schedule a time to meet him, please contact Wayside Adoptions at (816)986-4426. Thanks!**\nHi there, Im Louie! Im such a good boy! Im friendly and affectionate and gentle and laidback. I want to be your best friend and hang out with you all the time. I feel like thats what I was put on this earth to do. So, I hope maybe youre looking for a low-maintenance friend just like me to welcome into your life. Im ready!\nIm a darling, 9-year-old, 33-pound sweetheart with an expressive face and an unassuming, delightful personality. And Im already fully housebroken. Ive had quite a life. I originally came to Wayside about 4 years ago when a new baby arrived and made me nervous. I was then adopted by a nice family, but they brought me back to Wayside when they moved away and couldnt take me along. So now Im searching for a new family once again. Its scary to be alone, and the shelter can be a stressful place for a dog like me. Plus, it takes me a little extra time to warm up to new people. Thankfully, Ive been able to stay in a foster home as I wait for you to find me. My foster parents help me feel safe and special and loved. Ah, they are just what I needed.\nOnce in foster, it took me a few days to adjust and to learn to relax. My foster parents let me go at my own pace and they are patient and kind with me, gently praising me when Im a good boy, which is all the time. Ha! Im very well behaved in the house and I dont bother a thing. Foster Mom works from home, so someone is typically around, but I can be trusted to roam free in the house even when no one is home. At night, I sleep like a rock, soundly and quietly, on my dog bed in the bedroom. I dont make a peep all night. And I dont jump on the bed, even though I could. I never beg for food, Im quiet unless I need to alert the family that someone is at the door, Im content, happy, and such a nice friend. It fascinates me to watch the geese that gather outside our window. They provide me with entertainment! Sometimes I play with my toys too. Im initially wary when someone stops by, but I warm up with time. My favorite thing is to cuddle and bask in any attention you give me. In fact, I like to crawl up on Foster Dads lap to be as close as possible. We love to hang out together!\nWe have a fenced yard in my foster home, where I can play and explore, but I dont like to stay out for long. Im much more of a homebody and I dont need a lot of adventure or exercise to keep me happy. I do love going for leisurely daily walks though and Foster Dad says Im a joy to walk with. I dont pull on my leash and Im not reactive when I see other people or animals along the way. I live with another small dog in my foster home and we get along just fine together. We dont play much, but I enjoy his company. I will be happy to go home with another friendly, calm dog or perfectly content as your only dog as well. Young kids make me sort of nervous, so Ill need a home with kids over the age of at least 12. Im looking for a quiet and calm home without a lot of commotion.\nI promise I wont ask for much and I wont cause any trouble at all. I just want to be with you, loving every single moment of our time together. Thats the life I dream of. Nothing fancy, but just a simple life filled with the love that comes from the bond of a dog and his person. Thats all I need.\nLove, Louie\n ...",

Thank you!\n\nHello! My name is Ruby. I\u2019m a very sweet and very shy 5-year-old female Shih Tzu. I have beautiful coloring and I weigh a healthy 11 pounds. I came to the rescue from a puppy mill, which was very harsh, isolated and lonely.  I\u2019m still learning about the real world and everything in it. I\u2019ve bonded closely with my foster mom, but I\u2019m very cautious around other people. When I arrived in rescue, I had an eye injury, but it has since been treated and healed. I also have a chronic dry eye condition and will need prescription eye drops twice a day for the rest of my life. I love going outside, and potty training is going very well - although I haven\u2019t quite adjusted to being on a leash. My favorite things are hanging out with my foster mom in her office or on the couch. I love bedtime - my tail wags and I get excited to be on the bed with my favorite blanket. I hope I can find a quiet home with patient, loving people who can continue to support me on my healing journey. My new family must meet the following requirements:\n\n1. My new family must be experienced with dogs (ideally rescues) and commit to using positive reinforcement training methods, which may include seeking professional training, if necessary.\n2. Be willing and financially able to care for my ongoing health needs (i.e. regular vet visits) and administer eye drops twice daily.\n3. Must live within 30 miles of Plymouth, MN, so my foster parents can do a follow-up home visit.\n4. I need a home where my people are around most of the time and will provide a positive, supportive environment.  I can\u2019t be left alone for long periods of time.\n5. I can share a home with other non-dominant small dogs and friendly cats.\n6. Be physically able to lift me on/off furniture and up/down stairs (I haven\u2019t quite learned how to do those yet).\n7. Maintain my high quality dog-food diet (no human food). Sometimes it\u2019s tough getting me to eat and drink - my foster mom can give you some tips.\n8. I will run away when outside, so I require a secure, fenced-in yard or will need to always be on a leash when outside.  It\u2019s best to secure the leash before you even open the door.\n9. I am intimidated and wary of people both big and small, so only a quiet home with no young children will be considered.\n10. Agree to attend the Shih Tzu Rescue Reunion held in September each year.\n\nRuby is spayed, current on vaccinations, microchipped, and on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.  Her adoption fee is $320.00 plus $24.08 sales tax for a total of $344.08.  \n\n\nTo meet Ruby, please complete an adoption application at the website listed in the first paragraph.  Due to COVID-19, we must take precautions regarding home visits.  The foster parent will discuss the home visit procedures with the applicant(s) once they are approved for that step of the adoption process.  \n\n\n",

She has never chewed anything in the house, and she has never had an accident in the house.  She uses the dog door to perfection and will go to her crate for her safe space.  She will play with the other dogs when everyone feels like it, and she has just been great in the house.  She has NOT been tested with cats, and likely will be fine with kids, although she hasn't been tested for them either. \nHowever....  \n\nShe needs a fenced in backyard.  She is terrified to go on walks or be out in \"public\" to say the least.  Her first reaction is to bolt, and run.  In fact, she was lost because she backed out of a harness and took off.  She was terrified, wouldn't come to anyone and we were fortunate to have an experienced trapper come in and trap her. Otherwise may still be on the run in the big city. \n\nYou see, she lived in a kennel with very little interaction and socialization for a majority of her life.  She was isolated and wasn't taken places to learn about new things. \nSo, now, everything is scary to her and her first reaction is to run. \n\nSo whomever adopts her will have to be experienced and know how to handle such a dog.  Make no mistake about it, she is fantastic in the house, and just a wonderful pet, but her socialization is severely lacking. \n",

He would do best in a home without really young children since he's timid. \nHis adoption fee is $150.00 which includes being up to date on vaccinations including rabies & bordetella, microchipped, dewormed, on flea/tick preventative and neutered.\nWe are a FOSTER based dog rescue therefore there isn't one central location with open hours to see our available dogs.

            "description": "Meet five-year-old and 24 pound Sampson from China. This poor guy was left abandon on the streets after his homeless owner left Beijing. Luckily a local rescue took him in and held him for the last four years. Due to his disability and being visually impaired he didn\u2019t ever find a forever home. We were able to add him to a flight with other dogs we were already bringing. He\u2019s a shy guy who is easy-going and doesn\u2019t need much. He would do best in a patient experienced home. He is dog and cat friendly. He needs to learn English commands. He is a little bit overweight and would definitely benefit from daily exercise. We can\u2019t even imagine what he has gone through even just to get to the United States. He is very sweet and just wants love and will make a great companion.\n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $350 which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

            "description": "Meet Lucy, this girl was surrendered with a dog named Morty after they recently lost their person. While Lucy and Morty are great friends, they are not overly bonded and don't need to be adopted together, they wouldn't be upset about either though! (Check out Morty's bio too!) Lucy is a bit on the shy side at first but once she gets to know you she is so so friendly and loves to be pet. She is just as soft to the touch as she looks and those eyes melt us every time.\n\nLucy is a spirited little thing, weighing in at only 30lbs. She loves playing with balls, dashing around in the snow, and doing her best to get you to dance around outside with her! It surprises us she is 5 years old, because she still is a puppy at heart. She likes to sleep at the foot of the bed and wake you up by nuzzling your ear and gently kissing your cheek, which to us is the best way to wake up!\n\nLucy is dog friendly, but needs a dog as friendly as she is. She is confident every dog wants her to kiss their face and clean their ears, and when they say no, she doesn't seem to get the hint. She is house trained.\n\nLucy is UTD on shots, preventative, micro-chipped, and spayed!\n\nLucy 's adoption fee is $250, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nIf interested in meeting Lucy you must fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nLucy and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption through rescue! \n\n",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4512414.\n\nClancy is a big, fun loving dog that loves to play. He loves to play fetch and will drop his toy at your feet so you can throw it again and again. He will sit and wait for you to throw his toy or ball. He loves to play tug of war too. Unfortunately, he does it with his walking leash so Clancy would do much better walking if he has a harness. This big boy is also very treat motivated and will \"sit\" for his treats and take them gently.\n\nClancy is a young dog at only a year old and needs an adopter or rescue that can give him the basic training he needs. He needs to learn his manners when he's around other dogs. He's going to be a great, fun loving and playful dog to someone that can give him the type of home he needs. The shelter recommends that Clancy go to a home with older children. If you think Clancy would be a good fit in your home, please come and meet him today!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.",

She LOVES to cuddle and give kisses. \nThis doggo loves to snack and will sit pretty for a treat!\nShe is gentle and does great with children and with other dogs.\nPlease visit our site at http://zoosrezcue.org for more information on how to adopt.

            "description": "Animal Profile: Miller is an adorable 4 year old Chihuahua/Pug mix (best guess!) who will be joining us from California on January 17th. He is a happy, mellow little dude. We will post more info as we get to know him.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\n\nMiller was shy upon his arrival, but after some time to settle in and decompress in his foster home, he is doing so well! His foster mom shares, \"\nHis temperament is great, very cuddly and happy. He loves to be all up in your business, the closer the better. He still shows his belly when we approach and has demonstrated some nervous peeing if we move too quickly. He loves to play with his canine foster brother, especially chasing each other. He's more leery of our older dog, who is leery of him, but he's demonstrated no aggression at all with either dog. He's been doing great on leash! I'd describe his energy level as average, he likes to play but spends a lot of time happily sleeping as well. He has enthusiastically investigated every tiny hole in our fence so I think he could be an escape artist if allowed. Miller does great in his crate as well - he settles down and is quiet once he's in. Some light whining if he's in there too long, just when he's letting us know he needs to go potty. Overall, he's just a sweet and easy dog. And his curly tail is the CUTEST.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $475, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

            "description": "Adoption criteria for Georgie:\n\n\u2022 Knowledge of and experience using advanced training techniques\n\u2022 Experience working with high-drive herding breeds\n\u2022 Ability to work the dog daily, providing intellectual as well as physical stimulation; reference given to people serious about training for a sport (herding, agility, flyball, etc.) or work (search and rescue, other scentwork,  etc.) \n\u2022 Securely fenced yard\n\u2022 Human companion with dog most of the time, for life (after dog has adapted to new home, at most 2-3 hours per day alone) \n\u2022 Adults and teenagers only\n\u2022 Residence within 150 miles of Felton, CA\n\nGeorgie is an intense, focused, drivey, 18-month-old, 40-pound, tricolor Border Collie.   She is intelligent, fast, agile, energetic, cuddly, affectionate, and in need of a mentally challenging job. She is a demon at fetch,  as currently all her intensity is focused on balls.  She is a dream for a handler looking for a dog to train up in any pursuit.  She is not suitable for inexperienced handlers or for people who want an easy family dog.  She is a working dog who must be presented with problem-solving challenges every day.  \n\nGeorgie is very social and playful.  She gets along well with other dogs who will tolerate her intensity, but she is much more interested in working in tandem with her person.  She sleeps peacefully with cats but if bored will attempt to herd them.  \n\nAlthough she is extremely affectionate and cuddly with people she knows, Georgie displays some fear reactivity to new people, barking at them.  we have not seen any aggression or attempts to harm, but her handler will need to know how to counter-condition for this behavior.  Georgie was found running stray; she was filthy and matted and malnourished.  Her current caution is a normal and natural reaction to some bad times.  Anyone who throws a ball for her is granted her friendship immediately.  \n\nGeorgie is house trained and is nondestructive in the house.  She will sleep quietly in a large crate if her person is nearby, but she would much rather snuggle up next to her person's pillow.\n\nGeorgie has been spayed, has received core vaccinations and parasite prophylaxis, and has an implanted microchip.  \n\nIf you have been seeking an intense, loving, workaholic canine partner, and would like to assess whether Georgie is right for you, please write to\n\n\tLynxcat@comcast.net\n\nto request an application, or download from\n\n \thttp://www.paddingtonstation.us/available-animals.html\n\nOnly after your application has been approved can we set up an appointment for you to meet GEORGIE and her foster parents in FELTON, CA under strict COVID guidelines. \n\nWe always answer email if we receive it. \nWe never ship dogs.\nDo NOT use the \"Ask About\" button -- enquiries made that way often do not reach us. \n",

Jack loves going for his walks but pulls on the leash and will require a harness to make walk time easier as he just wants to run. He isn't a fan of young children, so a home where any are aged 14+ will be ideal as well as a fenced yard. He is anxious in the car and will whine or bark.  Jack will be neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. A family with JRT experience, and working with leash manners, potential food aggression that may present is beneficial. \n",

He has never lived with or been around other dogs. He needs an experienced owner who can devote a lot of time into crucial  training and socialization. \nHe will come fixed, chipped, vaccinated, and heartworm tested negative.\n\n***If you are serious about adopting, you must first complete and submit an application on our website.

It\u2019s very clear that this little girl was mistreated in the past, but she so desperately wants to leave that all behind and look ahead to brighter Colorado days!\nLeia loves people, but it takes her a little time to warm up to strangers. Once Leia knows and trusts you, she will never leave your side and would prefer if you will simply sit and hug and pet her all the time. She is very playful and her favorite toy is her squeaky ball. She will toss it to herself and pounce on it and sleeps with it most nights. She is kennel trained and enjoys having her safe space to retreat to when things get to be too much. She takes a little longer to warm up to men, but is working on trusting all hoomans! She is still getting used to regular life things like traffic and encountering other people and dogs on walks, getting braver every day! She is pretty well behaved on walks overall! Leia is incredibly gentle and is not destructive. If something makes her nervous, she will move away and find a safe space until she gets more comfortable. She is curious and willing to overcome her hesitations with a little patience and time!\nShe is learning basic commands and once she learns them, she enjoys pleasing people with her new tricks. Leia is also 100% potty trained! She is very silly and loves to watch TV, especially when there are other animals on screen.\nLeia needs a loving and patient home that can give her time to acclimate and help push her gently to explore new things. She could be in a home with children, but preferably older children that have a deep understanding of dog behaviors and are willing to give Leia lots of space. We are currently looking for a home without any other dogs or cats until we know how this princess does with other animals - she deserves ALL the loving anyway.",

            "description": "This goofy guy is Roscoe and he is a 4-6 year old Redbone Coonhound mix who weighs around 50 pounds! He came to us as a stray back in November and he was underweight and missing 75% of the fur on his body due to a severe flea allergy. (The picture with the green grass was taken a week or so after we got him in and he had already had a few medicated baths.) After a few months of proper flea treatment and medicated baths we are happy to report that his fur has grown back wonderfully and he has put on several pounds! \n\nRoscoe is a playful dog and loves to run around in he yard swinging his rope toy or begging on of the workers to play tug of war with him! He will also chase tennis balls but is better at keep away than fetch. He also loves chewing on Nylabones and carrying them around with him wherever he goes! He does also love to \"talk\" to people in the true hound fashion.  \nRoscoe does get really excited when he meets new people and does jump up so we are working on the down command and he seems to be picking it up quickly! He also knows how to sit and is very food/treat motivated which will help with the rest of his training! Because he came in as a stray we do not know if Roscoe is housetrained but he does really well in his kennel overnight with only the occasional accident. \n\nWe believe Roscoe would do well in a home with children who are 10 and older as he is still working on the down command and may knock smaller children over without meaning to. We have not had the opportunity to test him with cats but he did do really well with out senior Pit bull (Belle) when we had them together. We can absolutely test him with cats if a prospective home needs us to do so and he will need to meet any dog(s) in a prospective home to make sure everyone gets along. \nDue to Roscoe's severe flea allergy he does have to be kept on NexGard oral flea prevention year round for the rest of his life. This is something that most dog owners due (at least through the Spring and Summer) anyway but we wanted to make sure any prospective adopter is aware that this will be necessary to keep Roscoe in the optimal health. \n\nIf you would like to set up a time to come meet Roscoe please give us a call at 641-774-5113 as we are open by appointment only.\n\nIf you would like to donate towards Roscoe's care please go to the top of this page and click on the Sponsor button. You will then be redirected to his Petfinder Sponsor/Donation page. Any amount is greatly appreciated!\n\nRoscoe's adoption fee is $75.00 and that does include all of his Vet work.",

I'm maybe 8 certainly not older.  My health is very good now, I was somewhat neglected, not spayed and had a bit of a UTI.  Now I'm spayed, had my teeth cleaned and I'm ready.  I must have a fenced yard, no apartments, no small children, over 12 years old only.  I'm great with other dogs.  In fact I would be great with a playmate.  Girls boys, it matters not.  I'm so agreeable. Empty nesters that work from home or retirees preferred.  I love to race around outside.  Sometimes I'm a bit loud, but that's the Dachshund in me!

My name is Jawbreaker, but my friends call me \u201cJB.\u201d I am the sweetest boy, but sadly someone in my past broke my jaw and I have spent the last few months healing.  I am all better now and totally not focused on my past! I am still a young guy, and although I am an adult, I am basically an overgrown puppy! My exuberance for life is high!! I love other dogs and cats and people and all the things. My walks take awhile because I always want to say hi to everyone.  I am learning my manners and basic commands, and truly just love life. I need a fun, active family who will continue my training! \n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained).\n\nA $100 hold fee is required for approved applications and will be applied to the full adoption fee at the time of the home visit. \n\nADOPTER: Dog experience \nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 18mo\nFENCE: Required (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Yes\nCATS: Yes\nKIDS: Yes, over 5 please \n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female dog pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit. Thank you for your understanding!",

She\u2019s currently in a foster home with 2 adult dogs. \n\nLucy is very energetic and loves to play. When faced with new situations, she is timid at first but warms up quickly. She has been doing great at house-training and is crate-trained. She loves other dogs and will keep them entertained for hours of play. She would be good with kids but needs guidance on avoiding play biting, as she is still a puppy. She loves soft toys and blankets. She digs herself a little nest in her blankets when she is getting ready for bed. She also loves a good peanut butter in a kong \n\nPlease copy and paste the following URL for the adoption application:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/WUEijuPLvtcsTT3t7\n\n\n**To see all of our pets available for adoption, please copy this link.\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/search/pets-for-adoption/?shelter_id%5B0%5D=AL450&sort%5B0%5D=recently_added\n\n\nPaws of Dixie Animal Rescue adopts in the New England area. Our adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date shots, Microchip, Alabama Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you.\n\nThe pets are delivered by a licensed transporter.\n\nPDAR.info@gmail.com\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES. If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application.\n\nPlease be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in AL will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have.\n\nNOTE: All Paws of Dixie animals are located in AL foster homes. They will be transported north after adoption.\n\nIf there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\nWe DO NOT adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Kato!\n\n12-year-old, 70-pound Boxer/Retriever mix\nHouse-Trained: Yes\nCrate-Trained: Yes, however she is well-behaved when left to roam \n\nKato came to Pet Haven after spending two and a half years in a shelter. She is an absolutely lovely gal who displays what her foster mom calls \u201cresting scary face\u201d when she looks alert. But behind that stare is all sweetness and love. Her goofy personality has shone through since being in her foster home! \n\nAnd do not let Kato\u2019s age fool you! She loves to jog and sprints across the backyard in her quest to chase off squirrels and enjoys daily walks. She is very smart and learned sit and down and been wonderful on leash while in foster care. When she is not on walks, chasing fauna in the yard, learning tricks, or eating, she loves to take long naps. \n\nWe are sorry to say that she thinks cats are for chasing and has shown reactivity towards other dogs who do not ignore her and needs to be in a pet-free home. After two years in the shelter though, we think she has earned having a monopoly on all of the attention and belly rubs anyway!\n\nKato would love to find a forever home with a fenced backyard where she can stretch her legs and patrol for squirrels. Her forever home should also continue to work on her with building up confidence and slow, controlled socialization. And most of all, lots of love and affection!\n\nCheck out this sweetheart on Instagram: katothewonderpup\n\n\nHer adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

Deloris does get a bit anxious in new situations. She will need a family that understands this and will be patient with her. We definitely recommend crating her when you are not home. At least until she is comfortable and less anxious in her new surroundings. We do not think that is too much to ask of a new family for this gem of a girl. If you are looking for a middle aged pup with lots of love to offer in return for a loving, understanding, patient family and home. Please ask to meet Deloris today.",

I'll run for miles, chase a ball for hours, and still want to play at the end of the day. I like other dogs, am unsure of kitties (but might be too much for some), and any humans in my new home should be 16 years or older.",

He is fully vetted, microchipped & neutered\nBoots is a Pay It Forward dog. This means the adoption donation of $500 will help to save another pup needing rescue and vetting. If you are interested in this dog, please complete an adoption application.\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the suburbs surrounding Schaumburg (Illinois Residents only)\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

On the day (Tue-Sat) you're interested in meeting one of these animals, please call 360-352-2510 to make an appointment. (We start answering the phones at 8 AM.) Due to COVID-19 restrictions, walk-ins are not permitted so we can maintain social distancing requirements. To learn more about the breed(s) of this dog, please go to your favorite search engine and type the breed(s) and 'rescue.'\nThis is one high energy pup! Doughly's leg was fractured and recently amputated. But this doesn't slow him down one bit! This boy will need a little training for his exuberance. He's playful, friendly and would love to meet you. This dog is not suitable for an apartment and requires a fenced-in yard.\nThe dog adoption fee is $90. They come spayed/neutered, microchipped, first set of vaccines including DHPP (parvo combo), Bordatella (kennel cough), and Strongid (wormer).\nWe try to keep our list of available animals up to date, but some may be placed in adoption or adopted out faster than we can get them updated online.\nIf you'd like to check on the status of an animal, please call us at 360-352-2510. This is especially important if you are viewing this animal on any site other than Animal Services' website. We will need the animal's number (we have it listed as the name) in order to look up the animal.\n\"Adoption Pending\" means someone is in the process of adopting this pet, but has not yet completed the requirements. Please check back later to see if the animal is available, as we cannot accept reserve applications.",

We don't know much about their individual personalities, but they are a happy, healthy group of pups.\n\nPlease do your research before applying for any of these pups. TWC's are wonderful dogs, but require a great deal of energy and training. Like all hounds, they are very vocal and can be very loud. They are working dogs and can have a high prey drive. This is a good basic source of info: https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/treeing-walker-coonhound#/slide/1\n\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $400  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

Another 11 days before he would just follow his foster outside and go to the bathroom in less than an hour... and back inside without standing by the door barking for a half hour. 60 days into our journey and he sits calm in the tub while getting a bath and all0ws you to clean his paws. Every morning we're up by 6 and we spend an hour outside...practicing 'touch', hiding and seeking treats, getting used to new sounds and new things. He doesn't hesitate by the doorway at all, he usually happily follows his foster right out and happily follows her back in and he does his business mostly within 15 minutes. He does have setbacks now and then and most recently, it took over 4 hours of being out with him to get him in. Bisou needs someone with a flexible schedule who can work with him if he has setbacks. He loves his treats. He's amazing with all other dogs, big and small and would do best in a home with another dog. For having zero socialization its astonishing he's come so far. He's one of the most gentle dogs ever, and he's one of the goofiest. When he runs he runs sideways in this awkward gallop. The first time he saw his reflection in the sliding glass doors he tried to stick his head through the closed door to see 'the other guy'. When he's groomed shorter he almost looks white. When his coat is a little longer you can see the gorgeous apricot color that melts into the white and fawn. He is as gorgeous inside as he is out. He'll make the most loyal companion for the right person(s). It may not take 60 days the next time....or it may. But I can tell you this...it will be the best 60 days. He may adapt or he may not and may revert to old behaviors. Bisou will need patience and an experienced pet parent(s) who won't force progress on him, rather take his que as to what feels comfortable. That means building trust...and building trust takes time... A fenced yard is an absolute must. Loud noises and quick movements still scare him. As such we don't recommend a home with small/young children. As he's coming out of his shell he can get excited and jumpy. He's crate trained but not fully housetrained yet. He's working on it. We feel Bisou would do best in a home with another dog.\n\nBisou is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. He's about 15 months old.. Local adopters only as we need to be able to support any training needs and multiple meetings.\n\nBisou is a very special, very beautiful work in progress. Please only apply if you are fully committed and meet all of the criteria above.\n\nhref=\"http://www.3hearts4paws.com/forms/form_humanverify?formid=2718\" title=\"Click Here toApply\">3 Hearts 4 Paws",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n=========================================================\n\nJagger is a feisty, playful roly poly! He's the smallest little guy, but has a huge personality! He loves to cuddle with his litter mate Iggy and his human. He loves to play with toys. He is so very smart and has immediately figured out his puzzles to get to those treats! He goes potty on the puppy pads and hasn't had an oopsie in days! He's extremely food motivated, which makes training so much easier. We are working on \"share\" right now lol. His foster mom and dad have 3large dogs in the home as well as grandkids! Jagger likes to bark at himself in the window or mirror\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\n\nPuppies\nthat are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations.\n\nChildren under 8 years old\noften are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

She is fully housetrained and comfortable in a crate, and she\u2019s very well behaved overall.\n\nHer favorite activities include snuggling, going on walks, playing with toys (especially her soccer ball!), and playing fetch. With lots of energy, Lady Bird is assertive with other pups but knows when to respect others\u2019 boundaries, so she\u2019d do great with a friendly playmate!\n\nReady to meet Lady Bird?

We don't know much about their individual personalities, but they are a happy, healthy group of pups.\n\nPlease do your research before applying for any of these pups. TWC's are wonderful dogs, but require a great deal of energy and training. Like all hounds, they are very vocal and can be very loud. They are working dogs and can have a high prey drive. This is a good basic source of info: https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/treeing-walker-coonhound#/slide/1\n\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $400  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

We don't know much about their individual personalities, but they are a happy, healthy group of pups.\n\nPlease do your research before applying for any of these pups. TWC's are wonderful dogs, but require a great deal of energy and training. Like all hounds, they are very vocal and can be very loud. They are working dogs and can have a high prey drive. This is a good basic source of info: https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/treeing-walker-coonhound#/slide/1\n\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $400  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

            "description": "Meet Starr! Starr is a very important pup here Charleston Animal Society.\n\nIn the beginning of December, we took in a transfer of 15 dogs, including Starr, from the Bahamas. All of these dogs have displayed under socialized and fearful behavior. From this transfer there are four dogs left. We are looking for a patient adopter who has a background in handling a dog with these types of anxieties and who can create a safe environment. This adopter has to understand these dogs can be a flight risk, they are sensitive to noises and hesitant to approach people. They are also looking for a home with a confident helper dog. Any potential adopter willing to open their home and hearts to any of these four dogs please reach out to the Charleston Animal Society Behavior Team to set up a meet and greet. (843) 327-1527 or email behavior@charlestonanimalsociety.org",

We don't know much about their individual personalities, but they are a happy, healthy group of pups.\n\nPlease do your research before applying for any of these pups. TWC's are wonderful dogs, but require a great deal of energy and training. Like all hounds, they are very vocal and can be very loud. They are working dogs and can have a high prey drive. This is a good basic source of info: https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/treeing-walker-coonhound#/slide/1\n\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $400  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

Gets along well with other dogs and cats, however, because he is so hyperactive, other animals don't usually like him. He is learning how to be potty trained and can easily jump a 6 foot fence. He loves everyone and is overly friendly! He needs a strong, confident owner who will teach him manners and obedience immediately. He is very sensitive and submissive when it comes to verbal corrections.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4499381.\n\nJust look at Yohan's beautiful eyes and happy face! It's amazing that he's still smiling when he's been at the shelter for more than 60 days now. All of the volunteers have stated that they love taking him for a walk. He's very easy to take out of his kennel and walks easily on the leash. He does like to zig zag side-to-side when he's walking but once you know that, it's easy to get used to. He seeks attention from the volunteers and loves to be petted. He also knows \"sit\" for treats and takes them gently.\n\nThe one thing that Yohan doesn't like is other dogs. He will pull on the leash when he sees other dogs so he definitely has to be the only dog in the home. Yohan should not be taken to a dog park unless he's the only dog there. The shelter recommends that he goes to a home with older children (12+ years old).\n\nYohan needs an adopter that understands his only dog needs. If you think you can give Yohan the home that he needs, please come and meet him today! He's been at the shelter for a long time now and he's ready to go home!!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "Sky / Female / 1 Year / 52 lbs / American Bulldog Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Sky! Sky comes to us all the way from Hohenwald, Tennessee! When her owner was no longer able to care for her, Sky was left abandoned in their home. The local Sheriff had to go inside to rescue this gentle girl, and she happily went with him towards her new life. Once she was cleared to travel, Sky made the long drive to Canada in search of her forever family!\n\nSince being in foster care, Sky has shown everyone just how loving she is. She adores affection and snuggling up close to her humans. She is well behaved, mellow, sweet, gentle and loyal. She loves to be talked to and her ears will perk right up so you know she\u2019s listening. When she\u2019s not chewing her bones or getting belly rub, Sky loves to play fetch with her favorite tennis ball. Sky would do best with a family who is home more often than not and will include her in daily activities.\n\nSky is friendly and loving with people she knows. She tends to follow her family as they move throughout the house - she likes to be close. With new people she is quite shy and may growl or bark to ask for space. When she is warming up she should be ignored and her personal space respected. Once she can eliminate any threat, she will come around for a sniff. Adopters should have realistic expectations when meeting her, as it will take time to earn her trust.\n\nSky has confinement anxiety, so she does not like her crate. When attempting to crate her she was under extreme distress, and posed a risk to herself. She prefers to be left in a puppy proofed space where she feels safe and comfortable. If she is given enough exercise prior to being alone, she may whine a little but settles eventually. Adopters will need to have a flexible schedule and be able to support her through this.\n\nSky works well on leash, she is very cooperative and attentive to her people. She doesn\u2019t pull unless she sees a squirrel or something she wants to chase. She gets bored with walks around the same block, but gets very excited when she finds a new route! She doesn\u2019t know many commands yet but is very trainable and eager to learn. She is nervous of strange dogs and people, so socialization should be an ongoing focus.\n\nSky\u2019s ideal family would have at least one family member who is home most of the time. Adopters will need to have some dog experience and be comfortable working through her seperation anxiety. She would be overwhelmed in the city so would prefer homes in the suburbs or quiet country. She would do best with a detached house, with a full fenced back yard. Sky has not been tested with dogs or cats while in foster care. Based on her disposition, she would likely do well with calm and respectful children that are ages 10+.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Sky please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nSky\u2019s adoption fee is $800.
