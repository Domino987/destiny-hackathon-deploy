She loves her people but hasnt been well socialized with strangers or other dogs. Riely is very strong, needs training to keep her from jumping. No small children because she knocks them down. Never bites or is aggressive with my young grandsons.NO CATS or dogs in the new home. She will need a lot of socializing and training. Someone that is strong in the beginning to handle her.Riely's adoption donation is $150 to an experienced working dog home. Fenced yard is a must! Go to sccpets.com and fill out the adoption application.",

Fabulous NMAF foster, Andrea, spotted him and we were able to get him out quickly.  He was given all his shots, neutered, had a dental and a full set of bloodwork as well as x-rays of his spine and hips while at the shelter - all records will be transferred to his new adopter.  Our veterinarian checked him out thoroughly and indicated he is between 12 & 14 yrs. old and is doing really well, all things considered. We have started him on supplements for his arthritis, but he needs no other medications at this point.  He is a real trouper and a sweetheart on top of that, is potty trained and uses the doggie door in his foster home.  He has a sweet and loving disposition and just wants to be someone's shadow all day.  For the right senior-loving family, he would be an excellent companion and promises to give the remainder of his years and heart to them!\n\nMore Info:  Contact Jeanette at jeanette.debar@yahoo.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.\n",

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull/Husky mix\nSex: Neutered Male\nDOB: ~12/24/2018\nWeight: 68 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Affectionate, Playful, Goofy, Big Baby!\nHistory: Transferred from another shelter; stray\nGood With: Dogs, Kids 8+ years\nIdeal Home: Any home ready for a big, strong dog! No apartments, please.\nFence Requirements: Preferred.\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

She joined us as a stray from Maricopa County, and is now looking for her forever home. She has the typical energy for a dog her age (prime puppyhood!) and she enjoyed playing with other dogs during her behavior assessment. She's living at our adoption center and her bags are packed and she's ready to move on!All animals are altered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, licensed (dogs). Cats tested for FELV/FIV. Dogs tested for Heartworm. All animals are available to the first family that is a good match, and if we have more than one animal who is a good match, there will be a lottery for all matches. Note that families must have come in to our adoption center and spoken with an adoption counselor prior to any lottery (when we have lotteries, they usually occur on Saturday mornings).",

I am a \"\"Velcro Doggie\"\" which means I would prefer a home with someone that I can be with all the time - I get super sad by myself. I am housetrained, good with other dogs, and even okay with cats. I am neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations. My adoption fee is $150.00 with an approved adoption application. You can apply to adopt me by clicking here: https://us04.sheltermanager.com/service?account=hs0712&method=online_form_html&formid=3If you would be interested in giving me a furever home, please contact The Humane Society of Adams County, Inc. at (937) 544-8585 to set up a time to come meet me and fill out an adoption application!",

            "description": "Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

            "description": "Hana\nBreed: Beagle/ Jack Russell Terrier Mix\nGender: Female\nDOB: 12/23/2019\nHana is looking for an active home to call her very own. Hana has a lot of young dog energy and will benefit from an adopter that will help her learn her basic manners or enroll with her in obedience training. Hana will do best in an active family that can give her lots of exercise and a fenced in yard to run and play in. She is friendly with other energetic dogs and older children. Fill out an application and come meet this playful girl, we know you'll fall in love!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

She has had a very hard life and just wants a safe, quiet place to snuggle up in a cozy dog bed and watch everything going on around her. Madelyn doesn't ask for much but quiet, some food and some space to just relax. This poor girl has clearly been neglected and frightens when you come near her. She will scurry away or nip if she feels threatened. In the first week with us she has started moving around more and even trying to jump on an elevated dog bed so she is feeling a bit better. Madelyn is definitely a super senior who just wants a quiet place for her final time here. She deserves some peace and love on her terms for once in her life.\n\nNOTE: To adopt, please apply at polkadogz.org. All current pets must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations and heartworm prevention. We only adopt in Florida. All adoption fees go to help all the dogs in our rescue, manyh of which need major medical care. Thank you for caring for the greater good.",

Havana is marveled by her surroundings and can't wait to get out and see the world! Ever the confident girl, she is not bothered by loud noises at all. She is affectionate, adorable, and -- did we mention she really loves toys? Havana may be best for a family without children.

A home without another dog might be the best for him, or maybe a home with another laid back pup! That being said, he does love his humans! If you're looking for a new sidekick and adventure partner, Timothy just might be your guy. \n\nTimothys Story: Timothy was found as a stray in Phuket, Thailand. Since a large chunk of his life has been spent outside a home setting, his adopter will need to be patient with his adjustment period (as one does with any rescue dog!). \n\nDetails:\nGender: Neutered Male\nEstimated Age: 6 1/2 years\nBreed: Shepherd Mix\nWeight: 53 lbs.\n\nTimothy will be traveling from Thailand and will be ready to go to his forever home in late February! \nTo apply visit: https://www.rescueallthedogs.org/adopt-1",

Yayoki loves to cuddle, but also enjoys going for adventures and exploring outside! She gets along with other dogs and walks well on a leash. She is a total lovebug and is ready to share her love with the world!\n\nYayoki's Story: Yayoki came to Soi Dog due to a road traffic accident. During her intake examination on entry the vet found that she had a right femoral neck fracture and a surgical femoral head and neck excision was performed to treat the injury. Now Yayoki is a healthy dog and has since recovered from those injuries. She has a slightly uneven gait and posture because her right hindlimb is shorter than her left leg due to the bone surgery which resulted in decreased bone length in Yayokis limb. It is important that Yayokis adopter remain vigilant for any signs of lameness and ensures that her weight is under control and a light exercise regime is followed to avoid putting any strain on her limbs.\n\nDetails: \nGender: Spayed Female\nEstimated Age: 3 years\nBreed: Shepherd Mix\nWeight: 35 lbs.\n\nYayoki will be traveling from Thailand and will be ready to go to her forever home in late February! \nTo apply visit: https://www.rescueallthedogs.org/adopt-1",

Stanley is eligible to travel on 02-06-2021.\n\n \n\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis we are experiencing a dramatic influx in inquiries and adoption applications.

            "description": "Meet Bobby Boy!\n\nThis dude has very unique coloring and eyes that will melt your heart! He has everyone stop and comment on how beautiful he is! \n\n The best part about Bob is that he loves life, and he may have springs for legs. We like to refer to him as bouncy Bob! His joy is contagious. Who doesn't love to be around a happy dog? He zooms around the yard with joy, and will chase a ball with a wagging tail. \n\nBob is a beautiful 2-year-old happy go lucky boy. He weighs 56 lbs and seems to be in perfect shape. He is happy to greet people and his tail never stops wagging! He is food motivated and will do anything for a treat, so training is made easier. He enjoys brain games like puzzle toys or eating his meals out of a slow feeder toy. He loves to have attention from his people! He has a soft side too. Bob is very sweet and loves to lay on his back for belly rubs. He looks up at you to tell you he's glad you're there with him. \n\nHe needs a confident leader that will offer consistency and structure. Bob is looking for a home that is active and he would be a great running partner. He would like to be an only dog, probably no young kids because of his magnificent bouncing skills. \nHe is able to coexist around other dogs at his training house but not freely socialize, so needs to be an only dog and will not be a dog park dog, but dog parks are risky anyway!\n\nHe is potty trained, Kennel trained, fully vaccinated, and neutered. He is one of a kind and loves to be around his people. He is great for basic grooming needs. Bob is currently at a training facility working on his basic obedience and leash skills and he is ready to get started on the right track for his forever home! He is doing great with training and the training team can show you all that he has learned and how to implement it at home. \n\nWe would like for him to find a home that can embrace all his goofiness! For more information about Bob please email Jaime at jaime@threelittlepittiesrescue.org he is currently located in Vancouver, WA \n\nApply here: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30283/generic",

Loves snuggling and giving kisses \n\n \n\nAlthough still learning how to walk on the leash, she has made amazing progress in just a few days. She does stop if there is something or someone new, but then greets them calmly and gently. She does need further exposure to new things. She is still learning her manners, and will need some patients and training as she likes to counter surf. She is not a barker and she is housetrained.\n\n\n\nShe loves playing with her sister Lily, they love to play and run around together and would do best in a home with a fenced yard; as walks alone does not burn off enough of her puppy energy and a home with another dog friend would be amazing. \n\n\n\nShe is crate trained and we would recommend that she be crated when you are away from home - at least until you know she will not get into anything. \n\n\n\nIf you are looking to add an energetic pup to your family, apply today to begin the adoption process. https://www.fluffanimalrescue.org/molly-s-page-f",

An appointment is not required. \n\nIf an adopter wishes to bring a current pet for a meet/greet, please send vet records showing the pet is UTD on all vaccines prior to your visit to blackdogclub@outlook.com\n\nThe adoption fee includes spay or neuter, microchip, age-appropriate vaccines, rabies vaccine, fecal test, deworming, and heartworm test. Dogs are treated if heartworm positive. All dogs are UTD on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. All dogs are health screened and vaccinated by our vet, Family Pet Animal Hospital or Quality Care Animal Hospital.\n\nWe do not know if our dogs are house trained. They are crated overnight. \n\nBella joined us from a very loving home. Her owners adored her; however, they could no longer care for her due to their medical issues. She is house and crate trained. We tested her with other dogs (see video) and she passed with flying colors. Cats are iffy. Estimated DOB: 04/18/2018. Current weight: 45 lbs. Please ensure you are familiar with this breed! They are not for everyone. Bella will not be adopted into apartment life.",

            "description": "Oh, do I look like a familiar face? Well, guess what... I am! My name's Shania and Muddy Paws and I go way back... I was born on June 19, 2020 and my mama had a big 'ol litter of puppies. She didn't have enough milk to feed us all so me and four of my siblings came to Muddy Paws where we got bottle fed until we were big and strong. Once I could be out on my own I found a home but, well, I'm back at MP due to no fault of my own. I like my new foster family so much and I get to run outside in the backyard a lot! My foster mom says I'm still adjusting to the other big dog in my house so we haven't spent a lot of time playing together yet. I keep hearing people say, \"she's a very smart girl\" and I think they're talking about me! I know how to \"sit,\" \"come,\" and \"shake,\" and I even know what \"down\" means. My foster mom says that structure and routine are important for a little one like me and I think she's right. For example, I pretty much know how to potty outside but sometimes I need a reminder. One of my favorite activities (besides playing) is to snuggle up with my family for a cozy night together on the couch... that makes me feel so loved and safe. I hope I can find a family that likes to learn and play and snuggle as much as me!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Shania is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Kahlua is an 8-year-old Labrador/Jack Russell Terrier mix, who is super laid back and loves to just chill around the house and be cute! She's an excellent tug of war partner and enjoys being outside in the backyard or on a walk. She is good on a leash, so walks with her are quite enjoyable. She'll tug some but never pulls too hard. She does the cutest little head bop when she needs to go outside or wants some attention, but she's not overly demanding. She doesn't get on furniture, and she's happy to sleep in her own bed instead of yours if asked. She can be left out unattended and never chews things she shouldn't. She will thrive best in a laid back household without a lot of loudness or chaos going on, in addition to having a fenced in yard. She could share the home with a docile dog who respects her space and/or dog savvy children 12 years of age or older. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Kahlua is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "We're fond of Farley! It's hard not to fall for that earnest face. Farley has a charming personality that he is showing off more and more as we get to know him. He has some silly, puppyish energy and is always excited to get out and about on walks. He seems quite curious and active, and enjoys sniffing around outside. He has a passion for treats, and seems like he already knows sit and down on command. He seems to have a goofy disposition with just a bit of puppyishness thrown in (at around 2 years old, he is still kind of a teenager.) But he also seems to have a sweet side, and we think will be very happy to be someone's best pal. Once he settles into an active routine we think he'll make a great companion! Farley is around 2 years old and weighs 62 lbs.\nFarley unfortunately arrived at the kennel heartworm positive but the good news is that it is treatable. We'll cover the cost, Farley just needs to find a home where he can be on lower-activity and rest for a month and a half while he is recovering from the treatment when he gets it. Visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to find out more information and set up a meet with him!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

I am fully vaccinated, microchipped, and neutered. I can jump pretty high, so I need a yard with a tall fence or to be leash walked. I am not too fond of other dogs and I don't like cats; I would be perfect for a single pet home! I have a collapsed trachea, which is managable and it doesn't bother during an average day. I have to be walked with a Gentle Leader and wear a harness; this way there is no pressure put on my neck. I am optimistic that the right person will take me home any day now! Will that person be you? I would love for you to make an appointment to meet me!",

Archie's favorite pastimes include chewing on bones, snuggling, and taking long naps. Archie is fully crate trained and house trained, and is currently working on his leash manners. Archie loves to give kisses and is an affectionate pup. Archie would do best with someone who's willing to hang out on the couch and knock out a season or two of Game of Thrones on a weekend, with some nice long walks mixed in This pet is available for pre-adoption and may not be officially ready for adoption, as it is still undergoing medical treatment.

            "description": "Halo Top is a sweet gal who enjoys her me-time, but won't turn down belly rubs when offered. She loves walks and stopping to smell the flowers (or anything, really). Halo Top finds solace in her crate and enjoys people watching from her crate door. She can sometimes get into things she's not supposed to when left unattended and would benefit from continued house and crate training. Before coming to APA!, Halo Top was kept in a small room with just her siblings, so she doesn't have much experience with other dogs. She's looking for a human who will be patient with her and help her adjust with slow intros to dogs, cats, and other humans. She's pretty content hanging out in her crate or in another room and coming to find you when it's time for dinner or a walk, but don't be surprised if she sneaks onto the couch when no one's looking. If she has her leash on, she knows she's going for a walk and will head for the door, but she still has room to improve on other commands like 'sit', 'lay down', etc. If you're looking for a calm, lovable, and potentially lazy addition to your home, Halo Top is the girl for you!",

            "description": "If you're someone who likes running, outdoor adventures, and LOTS of cuddles, Balthazar is the pup for you! Balthazar, aka Zar, is the ultimate package. He's athletic, he's kind, and he's so well-mannered. Zar is a total sweetheart who knows no strangers, and is always excited to meet new people and greet them with wiggles and kisses. At the end of the day though, he's ultra-loyal and wants nothing more than love and attention from his person. He expresses his love with kisses and snuggles - he totally thinks he's a lap dog, and will always seize the opportunity to get close to you. When it comes to furry friends, Zar does best with active dogs who can play and romp around with him. We haven't observed him around older, more laid back dogs before. His foster mom is working with him on refining his playtime manners - sometimes he doesn't get the hint when other dogs are annoyed with him, and needs to be corrected now and again. We also haven't observed him with cats in a home, but he frequently interacts with strays near his foster home and has shown no aggression towards them. As mentioned before, Zar loves adventures and exploring outside. His favorite activity is hiking, where he can sniff and run around to his heart's content. He's also a fabulous running companion, and would love to join you on walks too! Even though he lives for his outside activities, this curious boy is also perfectly content just hanging at home with his person. He also loves toys and can entertain himself with them if he can't talk you into a game of chase or tug of war. Zar is very well behaved in his foster home, and knows all the basic commands and even some crate training too! His foster mom is currently working with him on separation anxiety training. Separation anxiety is relatively common in shelter dogs and can be treated with some basic training and stable routines. When his person leaves the house he cries out a bit, but really, he just has FOMO. Once his person leaves though, he calms himself down pretty quickly and will go back to chewing on a bone, cuddling up in his bed, or lounging by a window to watch the world go by. He can be left alone at the house with no issues but would love it if his person works from home occasionally. Don't pass up the opportunity to meet Zar, he has so much love to give his perfect family and he can't wait to cover them in kisses and do zoomies with you!",

Percy is known for never turning his nose up for a treat (which he takes from your hand ever so softly). He walks well on a leash, and just strolls by other dogs. He is house trained, does his business in the yard, and sleeps very soundly through the night. What more could you ask in a companion?

Taffy has an endearing curiosity and is eager to learn that the world can be full of wonderful things like tasty snacks, cozy beds, and people who adore her. Taffy came to us as a stray so her history is a mystery but we suspect that this girl would absolutely blossom with a loving, kind family. She can be a little shy at first, but once she feels comfortable, she's so happy to engage and connect. She would benefit from positive reinforcement training to help her build her confidence and learn new skills. While Taffy takes some time to feel at ease with new people, she absolutely lights up when she meets new dogs! She loves to play and would benefit from sharing her home with a social, friendly dog or by having the opportunity to have doggy playdates with her canine pals. Taffy walks beautifully on a leash and we suspect, that as you build her trust, she would make a wonderful sidekick no matter where adventure takes you.. whether it's day trips in the car or snuggles on the couch. Show this sweet girl what the good life is all about and she's sure to be your new best friend.",

But beneath that photogenic exterior is a bright, smart pup who is ready to learn new skills and tricks through positive reinforcement training. Russell is an attentive and engaged dog who learns quickly and would thrive with a family that will provide him with an enriching and fun environment. As a young, playful, and energetic guy, Russell would make an excellent sidekick no matter where adventure takes you! He has shown that he enjoys the company of other dogs and may enjoy the occasional play date with a dog friend. He is social and friendly with people, but would benefit from learning some manners to help him grow from a boisterous kid to a refined gentleman. His happy demeanor and goofy antics are sure to keep you laughing and bring an extra sprinkle of joy to your life!\n\nBecause Russell is a higher energy pup, he would do best in a home without young children under the age of 10 years old.",

From the person who is caring for Herbie: he is a love bug and is adventurous and will howl when she leaves for work. Herbie is currently living outdoors so we are not sure if he is house trained. Please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions to meet Herbie\n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

Diamond received a clean bill of health, and is ready to meet her furever people.  \n\nDiamond was recently returned to us due to no fault of her own. She lived with her family for 12 years, but due to circumstances out of Diamonds control, that environment was no longer suitable for her to live her best life. \n\nDiamond loves to go for short, leisurely walks, where she can take her time and sniff until her hearts content. She loves to play tug of war with her favorite toys, chew her bones, and cuddle up on the couch for a good long nap.  Diamond is a happy girl, wagging her tail often, and enjoys getting massages from her person. I mean, who doesn\u2019t enjoy a nice massage?! \n\nDue to a previous injury in her leg, Diamond does have some arthritis in her back leg, but don\u2019t worry, she doesn\u2019t let it stop her. She still gets around pretty well! \n\nDiamond does enjoy an easier going home and having the devotion of her people, so a home without younger kids would be best.\nDiamond is currently being fostered in a home with a cat, but they are separated from each other.  A home where Diamond can be separated from cats, or a home without cats, would be best.",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Chico is a petite ~2 year old chihuahua mix who was rescued from southern CA. He will be arriving with us Sunday, December 6th. More info to come once he arrives and gets settled in!\n\nFoster Update: Chico has quite a special story to share! He was originally rescued in CA after his previous family had to surrender him as he could no longer care for him. When Chico arrived in our rescue, it was clear he was in need of some major TLC. He was dehydrated, underweight, and skin was in rough shape - missing patches of fur throughout and his skin was red and irritated. He has had a wonderful, committed foster family to help heal him back to health and he is doing (and feeling) so much better! Chico has been on a high-protein, raw diet. His new diet has helped his itchy skin, and his fur is slowing growing back :) Chico will require a forever home committed to continuing his current diet so he can continue to feel his best self.\n\nChico is currently in a foster home with two other chihuahuas and two cats, and he gets along well with all of them. He has been great around his dog buddies, but would also likely do well as an only dog so he can take over the center of attention :) His temperament inside his foster home has been sweet, fun, and snuggly. He loves a cozy blanket to curl up to, and greets his fosters will a wagging tail. Chico does well in his crate, and his foster family has been working with him on his leash manners. He has been a bit insecure around other dogs on leash, which has resulted in some reactivity. Strong leadership and focus on leash manners has helped him greatly improve in this area. Chico is looking for a committed family comfortable and willing to continue to work on his leash manners.\n\nChico has been such a fun, loving, and wonderful little dude. He is food-motivated, smart, and eager to please. We know he is going to make one special family very happy!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

She also loves toys! \nNinja is house-trained and crate-trained, as well. She will sit and shake, especially for treats. Also, she enjoys walks. She walks well on on a leash and harness. She will pull so a harness is recommended. Some training would be good since she also will jump up if excited. Because of this and her strength, she would not be good in a home with very young kids, however, she has been in a home with older kids and did very well. She is good with other dogs and had showed absolutely no reaction to cats at all in her foster home so we assume that she is fine with them. ??\nNinja likes to go for car rides and loves to stick her head out the window. She will whine for you to put the window down for her. A fenced-in yard is highly recommended because she is still young and needs room to run and get her energy out. \nNinja would love to follow you and your family on any adventure or just curl up on the couch with you and watch a movie. Either way, she will be an awesome addition to any family. \n\n\n\n\nFee is $150",

I am 3 years old, male, wolfhoud/wire haired mix, current on vaccinations -rabies, distemper/parvo, dewormed, neutered. \n\nChewbacca barks a lot in his kennel, but once he is outside he is a very happy and playful boy. He hops around like a young puppy. He doesnt seem to be interested in cats, so he should be fine at a home with cats. He is a very playful boy, so being around children would make him happy. He is good with other dogs when properly introduced.\n\nAdoption Fee $475\nThis tax-deductible fee pays for the vaccinations, spay/neuter, boarding, food, and overall care of all the animals at the shelter.\n\n(*Includes spay or neuter with HHP vet. If a personal vet is preferred a partial refund will be issued. KEEP ONLY IF NOT FIXED)\n\n**If you're unable to adopt, please consider donating or volunteering your time to these deserving animals currently living at HHP. They require care and love on a daily basis, which adds up monetarily. Our shelter is funded by donations and adoption fees alone. The need is great within our community and your support matters.\n\nIf you have questions, please stop by any day between 1pm-6pm. Contact our office at (406) 896-1700 or Angie (406) 860-8735.",

My foster mom will also put me in it when she goes out just because I am a puppy. I live with my foster mom and her 2 dogs. We are working on sit and walking on a leash.\n\nCome see me and you'll fall in love.\n\nCostello is a male Hound/Shepherd mix with an approximate DOB 10/9/2020",

Although I'm a puppy I weigh about 60lbs so I'm a little big. Although I'm big I try to be gentle and I want is pets and belly scratches. I was adopted from this nice rescue with my brother over the summer, but my dad brought me and my bro back to my foster mom but I'm not sure why because I'm a good boy. My foster mom says I'm just a puppy and a good boy and I didn't do anything wrong. She said she's sure I'll find my forever home soon. I'm crate and potty trained and I haven't had one accident since being with my foster mom. I do like to have a buddy walk me outside to go to the bathroom at first so that I know that my new surroundings are alright. I need a fenced yard because I love to run and jump. I LOVE treats and will sit, lay, and shake for them. I think that all people and dogs are my friends and I like to play with them. Since I'm a big dog I will need another bigger dog in my forever home. I love to play with other dogs and really like running around and being goofy in a big back yard. \n\nIf you would like to meet Bo send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting....neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

So I am one big boy!  I was adopted from this nice rescue with my brother over the summer, but my adopters brought us back to my foster mom because we were too big for them to handle.  My foster mom says I am a good boy and I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and she is sure that I will find my forever home very soon.\nI am crate and potty trained, I even go to the door and whine when I need to go outside.  I will need a fenced yard in my new place, probably a tall fence since I\u2019m a tall boy and I don\u2019t want to accidentally get out of the yard.\nI love bones to chew on as I am still a pup and teething.  \nI think that all people and dogs are my friends and I like to play with them, but since I am big I will need another bigger dog in my forever home and kids who know how to play with a big dog.  I have a 7 year old human in my foster home that I think is awesome!  \n If you would like to meet Jax send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon as we cam\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting..my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

            "description": "Arthur is an adorable, approximately 9 mon old Terrier mix. He has such a sweet bubbly personality and seems to like all dogs that he meets. Arthur weighs approximately 35 lbs and would be great in any type of home setting. He walks reasonably well on a leash, loves to play and craves human affection. He was found as a stray dog and we believe that he was struck by humans. He does shy away from fast movements and often cowers when approached too quickly. He has never shown any sign of aggression, and we firmly believe he will easily overcome any prior abuse. Arthur has been tested with kids ages 10 years and 13 years old. He is very sweet and gentle, so he would likely do very well with any dog savvy child. He is short and stocky with the classic Basset legs. He would love to be a walking/hiking partner. Due to his breed we will not consider rentals.\n\nHe will be ready to transport after 2/9 to New England\n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention. A health certificate is issued by a licensed Louisiana veterinarian.\n\nAdoption details:  \nIn some instances, a meet and greet is not possible before adoption unless we have a foster home in New England available. Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors.

            "description": "ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS\nFenced yard\n\nHello everyone!\nJust wondering if anyone is looking for a companion that is suave, handsome, intelligent, really quite the player? If so...Well here I am! My name is Jagger and I am of German decent, Royalty I am sure of. And I am a young 2-3 years old man about town and I weigh appx 50lbs\nI love getting outdoors but prefer to lounge around the house with my people. At night I go to my castle, some call it a crate. I don\u2019t mind it but if you want I can sleep most anywhere. I like to converse with people when they are on the toilet but I prefer to relieve myself outside. \nI have a few tricks up my sleeve. I sit, lay down and shake on command. I would be willing to learn some more with a little persuasion and a tidbit of food. \nWhat are my dislikes you ask? Well small animals like cats and dogs are very disturbing to me and because of my size very young children probably would not do well around me. But I would love a brother or sister to play with and of course a fenced yard to keep all of my groupies from overwhelming me.\nSo.... anyone want to be blessed with my presence? If so, let\u2019s meet, I can teach you how to ...\n    MOVE LIKE JAGGER!\n\nIf you would like to meet Jaggar send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart  worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

            "description": "SAVANNAH is 7 years old and weighs 10 pounds. CHLOE is 7 years old and weighs 10 pounds.\n\nFirst off - we just want to state that we will each speak for ourselves, despite being presented as a bonded pair, which we are. We are very co-dependent on each other for mutual happiness and company; however, we know ourselves best and thus, will speak separately. See, we are independent littles cusses too.\nMy current human likes to call me Savannah Banana, although I find that Queen Savannah is infinitely more suitable. She is right that I am an emotionally in-tune kind of gal; however, I can be a bit more select in my choice of company than Chloe. That girl has no boundaries! But I will let her speak for herself. Once I make the decision to love you, there is no turning back for me. I am a love bug. I love dogs, I love cats, I love toys and I love snuggling under the  blanket in bed. My human also has a rather tasteless nickname for me calling me \"roadkill\" just because I sleep with my legs straight up in the air. I call it adorable myself. \n\nTake me on walks and I will love you forever, but I can be rather an escape artist if I'm feeling frisky. I can scale fences. I may be small, but I am fierce! Food is the thing I love best so please safeguard your trash can, unless you want to put me on Most Wanted Canines. Okay, okay, I'll let Chloe have a bark or two now.\n\nWell, it's about time I got some air time. I am Chloe and thank heavens I have no silly nicknames, but you can call me Princess since Queen is already taken by my comrade-in-arms. Princess suits me since I have been accused of being a bit of a baby at times. I mean, just because I cry to be picked up even when I'm on the bed snuggling - what's wrong with that, I say? And yes, I do tend to be less picky than Ms. S. Banana about relationships and get along immediately with new people. Some would say that's laid back and others we don't care what they say - less emotionally mature - baa humbug. Always wondered what an actual humbug looked like anyways. My favorite trick, and always a crowd-pleaser, is being able to leave a line of pee and poop while my back legs are up in the air. You'll just have to imagine that for now.\n\nI admit we both suffer from a bit of separation anxiety initially, given our past, I'd say that's excusable. We have been known to shred dog beds and blankets if left  alone for too long. Or, we mark places if something weird is left on the ground. I'm sure we will get over this once we know we are yours for keeps. \n\nSo please, someone keep us! You'll just love us!\n\n\n\n\n \nThey both struggle with marking inside if something is on the ground or if they are left. I think they would truly benefit from being the only dogs in a home so that they can really establish themselves and not have any competition.. They both need dentals done and have bumps in their nipples. In the first stages of their rescue they were putting holes in and shredding grey blankets or dog beds- They really need someone home with them at all times, their anxiety and fear of being abandoned will take time..\nThey are very co-dependant and should not be separated. When I first got them their ears were all cut up and soaking wet from them chewing on each others ears. These girls have had a rough past and deserve the best.\n\nHello - This is Savannah barking at ya: I am a real princess - truly. Wait until you see me in person, or is that in dog? Hmmmm. \n \nINTERESTED in SAVANNAH AND CHLOE? The first step is to fill out our online Adoption Application (address link below)\n\nNOTE: All of our dogs live in foster homes so it is not possible to setup a meet and greet prior to submitting an adoption application. Filling out an application doesn't obligate you to adopt, but it does save your place in line if there are multiple people interested.\n \nADOPTION APPLICATION (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-application.htm\n \nIf our Adoption Coordinator determines you are a good match they will contact you. This is a great opportunity for you to find out more about SAVANNAH AND CHLOE and decide if you would like to setup a meet and greet.  \n \nADOPTION FEE is $150, and there\u2019s a 10% Discount for Senior Citizens and Veterans.\n \nLearn more about the ADOPTION PROCESS here (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-process.htm\n \nWe apologize, but we are not able to answer individual questions about our dogs. We are a small, all-volunteer organization and we receive hundreds of inquiries. If you want to learn more about a particular dog, then please submit an Adoption Application. If your application is chosen, you will have the opportunity to meet the dog and to get answers to all of your questions. Thank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Hal is a feisty approximately 1.5-2 year old male Catahoula Curr mix. Hal was found as a starving stray dog. He had to be nursed back to health by the kind women who found him. She requested help from CAFA to get him vetted and placed into a forever home. Hal seems to be ok with most dogs, but we would recommend that he be dog tested with any future canine companions. He may not do well with dominant males. Hal loves to run, play and really enjoys his human love time. He has had limited exposure to kids, but we believe that he should do well with dog savvy kids ages 9 and up. Hal has a great athletic build for hiking, walking and possibly running. He has been treated for heart worm disease, and is now ready to find his forever home. Hal currently weighs 47 pounds. \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention. A health certificate is issued by a licensed Louisiana veterinarian.\n\nAdoption details:  \nIn some instances, a meet and greet is not possible before adoption unless we have a foster home in New England available. Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors. This includes a 48 quarantine, recheck by a MA licensed veterinarian, and issued a MA health certificate.\n\nVisit all our available dogs at www.cenlaallianceforanimals.comWe update and add dogs frequently.\n\nWe hope to help make a difference in a rescue dogs life into loving responsible homes.",

He is a 1 year old, 50 lb male, Australian Shepherd Cattle Dog looking to find his forever home! Milo is a high-energy, smart boy who will do anything for a treat. Milo currently lives in a downtown apartment with two other roommates and two other dogs. He is playful with the dogs at home but has shown protectiveness, barking and growling towards other dogs that he sees outside. Milo has been going to training since he was 6 months old and started group dog training in October! He is loved at Doggy Daycare once he is away from his mom but when I am with him he is protective towards unknown people and dogs. \nMilo's perfect home would be a place that is committed to his training and wants to expand on what he has learned. He should be  either the only dog or living with another dog who has the same training expectations and similar size to him. He is extremely on-guard and reactive while on walks but through training has developed healthy habits that must be kept up. He has not been around children or cats and I will not feel comfortable rehoming him to this living situation.                     \nMilo is crate trained, potty-trained, knows \"mat\" as his place command, sit, lay, stay, and is working on heel. He would be an excellent candidate for scent work. I know there is a home for Milo that has more experience, time, and resources to provide for him.\n\nMilo is neutered and fully vaccinated and has no health problems. He is located in Boise, Idaho!\n\nemail: lilygaustin@gmail.com\nPhone: (208) 697-9912\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING. HUNAH IS NOT PLACING THIS DOG. PLEASE CONTACT THE OWNER DIRECTLY.\n\n\n\n",

She has to stay in a crate a lot because she doesnt do well with the dogs here. Unfortunately she is destroying her crates and we are very afraid shes going to hurt herself. If we dont find a foster home for her soon we are going to have to spend a lot of money to buy her a special crate that she cant destroy or hurt herself in. This is money that could be used for vet care and other important expenses. Reagan is truly a wonderful, loving girl. She is just not happy living with other dogs and being crated. During her playtime, she loves going for walks and cuddling. Please help us find her a foster home. You can see from looking at Reagan that she has had an incredibly rough life. She has scars on her face and legs, she was bred likely multiple times, and she has tumors all over her body (we now believe they are benign). Her body looks aged beyond its actual years. Despite the neglect and abuse Reagan endured, her love for people has not wavered. She truly just wants to be around people and know how it feels to be loved by a family. Reagan is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, flea treated, wormed, heartworm positive (currently being treated), lymes negative, and microchipped. She is currently on Benedryl and needs to remain on it as it helps inhibit the growth of masses. She is dog selective but seems to be ok with cats. She is very uncomfortable in the main foster home with all the other dogs. Please help us find a foster family for Reagan. If you are interested please complete an application. **Applications will not be screened if they do not meet adoption requirements. **",

I am in the market for a new home because my moms work schedule (she takes care of sick people) has changed a lot and I was home by myself all the time. She felt that I would be happier with a family where someone is home more than gone. I am 8 years old and weight about 80lbs. I went to see my doctor the other day and had some bloodwork done to see if there was a medical reason for my weight. He said there isn't. I'm just fat and need to lose about 15lbs..How rude was that!!! I am housebroken and do fine free in the house as long as I have my bones and chew toys with me. I am crate trained but I hate it and do my best to get out. I have a bit of anxiety in new situations so it may take me a few days to settle in. I love my people, car rides and going for walks. I would love to have a dog sibling in my new home that likes to play but isn't all high strung like some young dogs can be. Are you looking for a dog like me??\n\nIf you would like to meet Digger send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can. \n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, bloodwork, a microchip and a wellness exam",

I was born 11/3/20, so I am about 11 weeks old and I\u2019m a German shepherd/Gator Pit mix, I am probably going to be a medium sized boy, currently weighing about 9 lbs.\n\nI am crate trained, I sleep in one at night. I am still working on potty training but foster Mom says I\u2019m doing really good. I have never had an accident in the crate and I do find the puppy pads if I don\u2019t make it outside. I get along with other dogs, in fact I love to play. I\u2019m still learning not to bite when I play, foster Mom says my puppy teeth are sharp. I have never been around cats but I love kids. I like to play but I am even happier when I can snuggle up with you. foster mom says I am the sweetest cuddle bug.\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that I'm an architect with a very prestigious firm!!\n\nHere is what I have to have in my new home:\n-a fenced yard\n-a tolerant K9 sibling who will play with me\n-I need to stay local to the Springfield, Mo area so I can finish my vetting or wait until my vetting is finished to go out of the area.\n\nIf you would like to meet Hutch send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation covers all vetting... my neuter when I am old enough, series of 3 puppy shots, rabies shot when I am old enough, heart worm medicine, flea/tick medication, deworming, a microchip and a wellness exam\n\n",

She has came a long way already within the last week and no reason to think she will not be fully house trained in the coming days. Currently Eliza's favorite past time is stealing shoes and hiding them in her crate but she hasn't chewed up anything thus far that she isn't allowed to. Her owners did not do her justice with providing training but is definitely eager to learn. Eliza is good with other dogs but we are unsure how she would do with cats. Once spayed on Feb 9th Eliza will be able to go to her forever home to be loves as she should be!.\n\nAll animals adopted from us are fully vetted including spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, heartworm test and deworming. Please email us at HookedOnDobies@gmail.com, visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/savingdobermankind or webpage https://www.savingdobermankind.org to request an application, inquire about an adoption fee, or to learn more! \n\nWe do require a completed adoption application to be submitted before discussing details of a specific Doberman. \n\nWe DO NOT have a central location, out foster homes are located throughout our geographic region including CO, WY, NM and TX.\n\nWe strive to PROTECT the privacy of out fosters. ALL Doberman meet and greets are conducted in a neutral meeting location made by appointment only.",

I was born 11/3/20, so I am about 11 weeks old and I\u2019m a German shepherd mix, I am probably going to be a medium sized boy, currently weighing about 10 lbs.\n\nI am crate trained, I sleep in one at night. I am still working on potty training but foster Mom says I\u2019m doing really good. I have never had an accident in the crate and I do find the puppy pads if I don\u2019t make it outside. I get along with other dogs, in fact I love to play. I\u2019m still learning not to bite when I play, foster Mom says my puppy teeth are sharp. I have never been around cats but I love kids.\n\nI can also whip up the best meringue you\u2019ve ever had!\n\nHere is what I have to have in my new home:\n-a fenced yard\n-a tolerant K9 sibling who will play with me\n-I need to stay local to the Springfield, Mo area so I can finish my vetting or wait until my vetting is finished to go out of the area.\n\nIf you would like to meet Starsky send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation covers all vetting... my neuter when I am old enough, series of 3 puppy shots, rabies shot when I am old enough, heart worm medicine, flea/tick medication, deworming, a microchip and a wellness exam\n\n",

That along with puppy breath makes me irresistible!! I am only 8 weeks old and I along with my siblings were found by a nice lady that saved us and brought us to rescue. I have had my first puppy shot and my doctor said I am healthy and doing great. I am a typical puppy that does puppy things so I need someone that is home a lot to be able to teach me what I need to know. I also need a dog sibling in my home that will play with me. Not a senior dog that I will torment with my shenanigans. I also must have a fenced yard and must stay in the Springfield MO area as I have several vet appts over the next few months. \n\nIf you would like to meet Onyx send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter when old enough, set of 3 puppy shots, a rabies shot when old enough, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam\n\n\n",

I never bit anyone but just did a little growling and Mom got nervous and thought that I would be happier in a new home without small children.   It is taking me a little time to warm up to the adults but loved the teenage children and jumped up on the couch to sit with them.   Would someone like a quiet small best friend to keep them company?   If so, PLEASE FILL OUT THE APPLICATION on the website of www.4Paws4U4Ever.com under How To Adopt.    Thank you for looking.",

He's been in rescue for a bit in a shelter like environment so he's not had a lot of formal training however he is create trained. He came as a stray so we dont know his history prior to coming to us. He has average energy for his age and size and does well with other dogs and humans! Hes not been cat tested at this time. \n\nHe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but can make the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Feb 6th\t with a pre-adoption which is the only way to secure that he will for sure go home with you! Pre-Adoption means getting your app in, approved and paying the adoption fee to secure the ride.  His adoption fee is $450 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too! If you are interested in pre-adoption you can click the link here or copy/paste and fill out the app to get started: https://form.jotform.com/PNWdogs/ttrt-pnw-ap",

He is wary of loud noises and sudden movements and will need to go to a home without toddlers or small children. He is not good with chickens. Dusty would do best to go to a home with a fenced in yard or to a large SAFE property where he can get the exercise he needs.\n...................................If you would like further information or would like to request an adoption application, please e-mail us directly at hss@cablelynx.com.

That along with puppy breath makes me irresistible!! I am only 8 weeks old and I along with my siblings were found by a nice lady that saved us and brought us to rescue. I have had my first puppy shot and my doctor said I am healthy and doing great. I am a typical puppy that does puppy things so I need someone that is home a lot to be able to teach me what I need to know. I also need a dog sibling in my home that will play with me. Not a senior dog that I will torment with my shenanigans. I also must have a fenced yard and must stay in the Springfield MO area as I have several vet appts over the next few months. \n\nIf you would like to meet Opal send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my spay when old enough, set of 3 puppy shots, a rabies shot when old enough, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam\n\n\n",

I am a 3 1/2 year old male poodle mix from Shanghai, weighing a compact 18lb and 16 inches tall.\n\nMy owner dumped me outside of a shelter in Shanghai. When I first arrived there I developed a bad habit of biting my own tail because of anxiety.\n\nI had found a home in Canada, but I started to attack my back foot as well as my tail, to the point where my owner couldn't leave me at home alone and had to bring me to work. So, she's made the painful decision to rehome me, in hopes that someone will find me that can be home all the time to monitor me. She thinks it's because of either pain, or a history of being tied up by my leg back in Shanghai. I will growl and snap at anyone who tries to touch my back end or stop me during one of my tail/leg attacks.\n\nI had surgery done once I arrived to Canada to fix a luxating patella, and also had to get some of my teeth removed. The surgery definitely helped with some of the pain in my leg. I'm on a few different medications right now to try to help more.\n\nA few reasons why you should bring me home: once I am close to you, I am super cuddly! I can cuddle with you all day on the couch. I also absolutely love going for walks and being outside, and I love to run around and play with other dogs as long as they aren't too energetic for me. I'm also housetrained, and am great in the car.\n\nI'm also great around kids, as long as they respect my boundaries and are gentle with me. Cats, not so much. I want to chase them if they interact with me.\n\nI like practically anyone as long as they are gentle with me, but if you have a super deep voice, it might frighten me a bit. I also don't like to be picked up because I'm so conscious of my back end and tail. \n\nI have quite a bit of separation anxiety, so a household where someone can be home most of the time would be ideal for me. A quiet house would do me good too, since I'm not great with people coming to the door. I'm okay with people once they are inside and I know that I can trust them, especially if they leave me be. I just like to be left alone most of the time.\n\nMy current owner says I'm the sweetest little guy. So what do you say, do you want to bring me home?\n\nI am neutered, vaccinated and microchipped and my adoption fee is $650 CAD + applicable taxes.\n\n \n\nDisclaimer: It is important for all applicants to visit our website,  http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca/adopting/  and to read about Loved at Last Dog Rescue. \n\n \n\nInformation included in the profile is provided to us from the international rescuer or local fosters.

            "description": "Blossom is looking for an active home with a yard and another playful med/large dog.  She is about 35lbs and thought to be around 3yrs old.  She shows some herding tendencies with people (and other dogs), so would do best in a home with kids over 12. Blossom came from Mexico with a non contagious skin condition so it still growing in fur, but she is ready to start her search for the perfect home. \n\nHere is what her fostermom has to say about this special girl:\n\nBlossom is the puppy playmate of the year. Every dog who meets with her vies for her playtime, often surrounding her and trying to get her attention first. She is currently in love with her young foster brother and would like to have another playful dog to live with. They wrestle throughout the day and often nap on top of each other. When she isn\u2019t romping with other dogs she likes fetching balls, car rides, and squeaky toys. She is house trained, dog door trained, and crate trained. Blossom also adores \u201cher people\u201d as well. She takes a while to be affectionate with new humans but when she realizes they are part of her pack she is loyal and extremely loving. She wants to protect her pack and will alarm bark for every person or car that drops by. Due to her barking she will need to go to a quiet home or big yard where the neighbors will not find that bothersome. Even though Blossom began her with a very ruff start on the streets of Tijuana she remains happy and healthy. Her coat is still growing back in, and although she will likely fill out more, her coat remains thick enough for her to enjoy the snow up in Truckee at her foster home. Blossom gets the \u201czoomies\u201d in the snow and runs joyous laps on fresh powder days. She is an awesome powder hound but would be happy anywhere as long as she has a family to call her own.\n\nPlease email right away if you would like to learn more about this dog......and visit our website www.siarescuers.org to learn more about our rescue group.   Adoption fees range from $200-$400 for dogs.  THE DOGS SHOWN ON THE SITE ARE IN FOSTERCARE - WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER TO VISIT.

Different policies and fees may apply.\n\nMEET RORY!\n\nRory is approx 6 years old. Looking for her forever home!!\n\nYou will find me waiting pretty and proper with my favorite little teddy bear in my mouth. It's the only thing I have with me still from my old life and it brings me comfort. I love my toys and I sure love to show them off, I really don't think it's too much to ask for a family to spoil me with lots of toys (squeaky ones) and affection because I am a silly pup stuck in a big girl body!!\n\nI'd love to be your one and only pet, I'm not the best at sharing the spotlight. This new age world has some crazy things that really scare me, like TVs, vacuums, and dishwashers. But you can't blame me, I'm not even from this century! I'm a simple dog who needs a slow introduction to these fast-changing times! I love my kennel because it helps me feel safe at night, and I am very much potty trained in a home. I get anxious when left alone, but that's just because I have a love for people that LOVE ME.\n\nIf you are looking to open your heart to once in a LIFETIME pet who can share the secrets of the past with you, while we walk hand in paw into the future together, please take the time to apply to meet me! I can't wait for the op-paw-tunity to meet you!\n\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n\n--All current vaccinations\n\n--Microchip with free chip registration\n\n--Free wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet",

Barney was rescued by Animal Rescue Relay from the shelter in Fresno, CA, where he was listed as a stray. \n\n? Barney is a chihuahua mix and probably only weighs about 7-8 lbs. Barney came to the rescue very emaciated and scared. Trying to put some meat on his bones...\n\n? Barney is neutered and will be all up to date on shots! I\u2019m guessing Barney is around 10 years old. Barney is very mobile but appears walk slowly as his hind legs look feeble.\n\n? Barney\u2019s past is completely unknown, but it seems obvious that we was most like neglected and abused, Barney takes while to warm up. Barney likes to stay in \u2018the mix\u2019 and follow you around, but at this point he prefers not to be let or touched unless he initiates it first. \n\n? Barney has no teeth so he needs some soft food as an option but he had been seen gumming small bites dry dog food.\n\n? Barney is good around my other dogs, large and small, as long as they don\u2019t invade his space.  Barney will correct other dogs appropriately with a low growl. Barney is not aggressive.\n\n? Barney us a special little old man, and will need to go to a home that is quiet, without small children and preferably with experience with abused dogs. Barney loves nothing more than cuddling on your lap or the bed, but only when he chooses it.\n\n? Barney is very intelligent and observant.\n\n? Barney is extra gentle with my blind fister babies and seems to enjoy looking after LuLu, as he can be seen gently guarding her as she sleeps quite often. \n\n? If you\u2019d like to meet Barney, please contact me, Anderson Rose, in a PM.\n\n? Applications can be completed via:\n\nhttps://animalrescuerelay.org/adoption-application/\n\n? Adopting seniors, or dogs with disabilities takes very special homes... please consider the rewards of taking in a soul that other threw away carelessly. \n\nHeidi Neilson, Kelly Pettit-Lopez, Vanessa Jennings",

And you will love this handsome fella who has been affectionately called Pickles and who was found abandoned and starving in a rural area of Tennessee. . This young boy is a Pit mix that is only one year old and weighs in around 55 pounds. After he was found in such bad shape, he immediately became affectionate, giving slobbery kisses to his new foster mom who found him. He was so grateful and thankful to not be scavenging for food and water or a place that was safe to lay his head at night. Pickles does great with other dogs but isn't impressed by cats or chickens. He is a bundle of energy and excitement and he would do best with older children that can handle his affectionate jumping for attention. We are looking for a home with a fenced yard so that he can have the freedom to exercise and explore with no confined boundaries like a small kennel. If you need love, kisses, adoration and fun in your life, Pickles is the guy for you! Foster Jessica would be happy to speak with you about how wonderful this boy is!

There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test; and most mixed-breed dogs may have 3, 4, 5 different breeds in their mix!\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nSUPER SNUGGLER ALERT!  \nRanger is a handsome, unique young man who is looking for some new faces to kiss with his crazy tongue!  He's 18 months old, a great/compact size at 35#, and believed to be a mix of Dachshund and American Staffordshire Terrier (we aren't kidding)!  He is a very loving, loyal, and wonderful companion to his person/people. He adores climbing into your lap, burrowing under the covers with you, or fitting himself in just about anywhere he can to give you some love!  \n\nIf you're working at home, he's happy to lay by your feet or curl up on the couch chewing a bone until you're through. If you need a movie-watching buddy or a napping partner to keep you warm, Ranger's your guy! Up for an adventure? Ranger loves to see and do new things, and enjoys exploring trails on a hike, or going for walks down a quiet road!  Any activity you can dream up, Ranger is willing, ready, and happy to join in.  He is super friendly and sociable, and greets new people with excitement and happy wags!  Due to his exuberant greetings, we are recommending an adult family for Ranger, preferably without other animals so he can get the lion's share of affection!  He is extremely smart and easy to teach (especially with the promise of a treat, which he takes oh-so-gently!). If he's sitting in your 'spot' on the couch, just point to where you'd like him to be -- he will move there so you can sit down, then this little lover will smoosh in close to you.  \n\nHe's house-trained, and will wait by the door to ask to go outside.  He knows 'sit', 'stay', and is quick to pick up on cues.  Ranger would love a family who wants to teach him tricks, do different types of activities, and keep his mind engaged.  His ideal family will give him the opportunity to experience new things and to use all his senses. He loves to sniff and investigate his world, and a forever home with some fields and woods would make his heart happy!  Ranger does not enjoy a crate--he is happiest on the couch or a dog bed, and he'd love a family who is home more often than not. Ranger is looking for an adult person or adult family he can give allllll his love to, and who will make him their best friend!\n",

            "description": "Frankie is a 2 year old, White Shepherd mix that was surrendered to the rescue for having a pinched nerve. After several weeks of laser therapy and rest, he is now symptom free. Now that Frankie is feeling his best, he is ready to start the search for his FURever family. \n\nCharacteristic of his breed description, Frankie is loyal and loving. He is affectionate towards people and loves the company of other dogs. Frankie enjoys running outside and going for long walks. He is excellent on a leash and is very responsive to commands. As with any dog, Frankie would benefit from a structured daily routine and continued training once he settles into his new home.\n\nIn order to be considered as a potential adopter, we will need you to complete our online application at www.arrus.org. Should we choose to move forward with your family, you will be notified via email within the week.

We apologize in advance for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. \n\nAdditional information and/or medical records for this rescue pet are available and will be reviewed in person should we choose to move forward in scheduling a meet n\u2019 greet.

He has gotten along with other dogs, but he wants to choose his dog friends. A dog intro is required.

He knows sit, takes treats gently.\n\nNo apartments/condos/townhomes- he needs home with a backyard\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please text 480-359-7109 for any questions or fill o t the online application www.underdogaz.com He is with Freedom Brothers Rescue\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "Meet Bo!\n\n12-year-old Bo was brought to the San Diego Humane Society after his owners passed away. He had a full veterinary work-up at SDHS and is quite the healthy senior gentleman! He needs dental surgery to remove a few fractured teeth and clean the others. Bo also has cyst on his eyelid that is in a good location for removal, likely at the same time as his dental. Otherwise, his bloodwork, urinalysis, and ultrasound came back normal.\n\nA few hours after arriving on January 27th, Bo was scooped up for a two-week Frosted Fling! We received this great update from Bo's Fling Mom: \"Bo is such a fun and loving boy! He loves toys and can entertain himself with a ball for quite some time, but he also LOVES a good game of fetch and will keep nudging at the ball for you to play with him if you stop. He has a great appetite and is super food motivated and will sit almost instantly if he thinks he might get a treat. He knows sit, down, and seems to know his name and have some recall. He loves all the people he's met and will throw his whole body at you for pets. He walks great on a leash and has a good pace - I think he would make a great hiking/adventure buddy. He definitely acts younger than 12 years old. He seems like he still has so much life left to live, and he has so much love to give to a lucky family.\"\n\nBe sure to watch the video of Bo playing fetch and showing off the commands he knows!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/28/21 KG",

He was rescued after being dumped in a remote area with several other dogs.  He deserves to know the love of a forever home.\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

I may show some herding instincts, which usually come out with anything running around or being too rambunctious. I have a lot of energy, I may be too rambunctious for small children, so a home where any children that are school aged may be best. If you're an active family that looking for a dog to do fun activities with, I'm your kind of canine companion! I need to meet any children and dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Dixie will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Dixie 1341715 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

            "description": "Hi I'm Abby. People might describe me as bashful or maybe a little sensitive to my surroundings. This just means you'll be the apple of my eye and my source of safety and security. I'm looking for a person that will understand me and help me gain confidence at my own pace. I would appreciate a quiet, low-traffic home, as a busy household may be overwhelming for me. I need a home where any children are at least in their teens. Because I get a tad nervous with noises and meeting new people, I'm probably not cut out for apartment-living. I'm a dog that needs to be the star of the show. This means that I need a home where I'm the only dog so your attention will solely be on me for your canine companionship. I need to meet all family members in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Abby will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Abby 1370120 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

Then someone finally put a plea on social media for rescue to help because by then she had lost trust in people. Thankfully after sitting in an old dark crowded barn for 20 hours, our volunteer was able to rescue her and her 5 babies. The babies have been adopted and our sweet but shy Lu is ready for a nice quiet home with a family who will give her the time and space she needs to form a bond. If you are interested in this lady please visit funnyfarmrescueranch.org to find the adoption application and to read all about the adoption process.",

He loves people, and loves to be loved on. We think he'd be okay with another small dog, or fine on his own. Bigger dogs make him nervous. Sprout is 2 years old and fully grown at 14 lbs. He's fine on a leash and we think he'd be okay in an apartment or condo. Some of Sprout's coat was dyed pink at some point, and his nails had been painted pink as well. Whoever styled him did not care enough to love him furever, because he ended up terrified in a rural shelter. We've promised Sprout we'll find him a home where he will be loved for the rest of his life. If you'd like to meet adorable Sprout, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

They survived for each other. The way they love each other is just unexplainable. They have been through the worst together and because of this, they will experience the best together. Heaven & Angel ARE A BONDED PAIR.\n\nHeaven (IN PINK) is:\n-Playful\n-Loving\n-Submissive\n-Nervous/Anxious\n-Friendly\n-Crate trained\n\nAngel (IN BLUE) is:\n-Energetic\n-Loving\n-Dominant\n-Nervous/Anxious\n-Sweet/Kind\n-Crate trained\n\nBoth ladies are AMAZING with other dogs and do well with children. They tend to play bite and jump so we do suggest supervision if children are under 10 years of age. They absolutely LOVE to play with other dogs as they never knew what fun was until they joined our family! \nThey are SO loving and will love you very much. Although Angel is more the attention seeker, Heaven will never turn down some pets! Heaven is more of the mellow one where she won't bother you for things or chase other dogs. She gives you your time and will accept any love sent her way. These two girls COMPLETE EACHOTHER in every way. \n\nThey would do best with:\n-An ACTIVE family\n-Home with FENCED IN YARD\n-Home with LOTS OF ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS\n-Someone who has enough love for the both of them\n\nIf you believe Heaven & Angel are meant for you, please fill out an adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL INFO@MERCYFULLPROJECTS.ORG\n",

She was surrendered by her family. \nShe's very quiet, observing all that surrounds her, this is probably why she failed as a \"hunting dog\".\nShe just wants to be a family member, she has no interest in chasing anything. \n\nA quiet home would be best suited for her with an understanding family.\nShe had already had a litter prior to coming in but was spayed on Monday, so no more puppies for Lady! and no more hunting trips, just laps, couches & beds are what we are looking for.\nShe walks nicely on a leash & is getting extra TLC from us to build her confidence. \n\nLady is available for adoption now, if interested please apply at www.amherstanimalshelter.org/adopt\n\nAdoption fee & vetting include: Exam, Distemper, rabies, deworm, flea protection, 3 way heart-worm test and alter.\n\nOur hours are:\nMonday - Friday 10-4, Wednesday open until 6 p.m. and Saturday 9-1.\n\n",

            "description": "COURTESY POST (Northern VA) Meet sweet George! He's a 5-year-old pup in need of a new home. He lived with the same couple since he was a puppy and used to be a trusting dog until he was attacked by 2 unknown dogs in a dog park and he became very fearful. He was attacked in his lower back, so he is particularly worried of anyone reaching for that spot. Although his family loves George dearly, his current home is going through major changes and he needs stability and not a lot of visitors. He desperately needs a home that will help him build confidence and learn to trust again. George is a wonderful, intelligent, and obedient pup. He knows his commands and is food motivated.\nGeorge's criteria for a new home include, a calm, low-traffic home, a home with adults only (or older, considerate kids, ages 15+); he is not good around small kids as he does not like sudden movements or loud noise, someone that is home most of the day, a home with a fenced yard.\nGeorge LOVES cats!!! He has had canine BFFs in the past, so he has been socialized and is fully capable of accepting certain dogs, but since he is dog-selective, a meet and greet with the resident dog is a must.\nHe is vaccinated, neutered, and house trained. His adoption fee is $300. If you're interested in adopting this sweet boy, please complete an adoption application at lovepawspg.org.\nNote: George is not a LOVEPAWS dog. We are courtesy posting him for his family, so we will share all adoption applications with the person helping his family find him a new home and she will reach out to applicants directly.",

So right now I am in the rescue learning that when a hand reaches out to me they are not going to hit me.  I was alone with my babies when someone found me and gave us all to No Greater Love. I was a very good mom.  I wanted my babies to know that their Momma loved them so much.  They have all found homes but I am still waiting.  I am a small girl at only about 25 lbs. Please help me to trust humans!  \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have! If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement! \n\n Adoption Donation: Unless otherwise stated in the pet's bio, our standard adoption fee is $250 which covers age appropriate vaccines (DHPP vax) and (Rabies vax if 12 weeks and older), utd on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, worming, heartworm test @ age 6 months or older, microchip, fostering costs and health certificate.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!\n\nWe do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21",

            "description": "Meet Nicholas and Noelle! They are 4 month old husky/pitbull mix puppies. We would love to see this brother and sister pair adopted together. They will grow to be large size dogs and will need a fenced yard. They are typical puppies. Very sweet, cuddly and playful! They will need a home where they will have plenty of room to grow, and a patient household to help them learn the do's and don't of puppyhood! If you would like to make Nicholas and Noelle a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org.\nAdoption Fee For Pair: $250The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

She was all matted, so recently shaved, freezing and skin and bones. We got her on a feeding schedule and got her strong enough for a spay and some lower teeth extractions.\nMiss Cloud also known as Bean is 7 years old and fully vetted.\nShe is being fostered in Randolph MA with 7 other dogs and a cat. She can chase the cat so recommending no cats for her forever home. She exists well with other dogs but does want to be the center of attention. If not a single dog home than an experienced home with multiple small dogs a must.\nShe is used to being in a fenced yard or being carried. She sleeps on the bed at night and will need that accommodation moving forward.\nBean is an early riser and wants breakfast around 630AM so non morning people do not apply :) \nDr Cornelia Cloud is an amazing pup and the family we pick will be filled with daily smiles and cuddles.\nOur application can be found on our website on the available dogs page.\nThank You!",

He is 5 years old, a great weight at 45 pounds, and he has that classic black and white Border Collie coat and a full tail.  Martin is housebroken, create-trained and knows some basic obedience commands.  He rides great in the car and walks pretty well on leash.\nMartin is shy when he first meets someone new, but he warms up quickly and then it is game on!  He loves to play with his foster family.  Martin is a medium energy guy who loves to play catch and will return the ball or toy and drop it in your lap every time!  He also loves to play tug of war with rope toys but he is not pushy about play \u2013 he will wait until you invite him.  Martin also loves to play with other dogs, and when not playing he loves to just hang out with his dog pals.  He really enjoys their company.  Martin stalks the resident cat.\nThe ideal home for Martin is friendly and loving, shared with people who are ready to welcome a great guy like Martin into their lives.  A fenced yard is important, another playful dog would be welcome, and children over the age of 12 are fine with him.  Martin would also do best with a family where someone is home during the day.  He is such a \u201cpeople dog\u201d, and the more time he can spend with friendly humans the better!  This amazing guy will add so much to his next home.  If you are \u201cin the market for a Martin\u201d, apply today!  Martin is fostered in West Jefferson, NC.\n",

Well....here's where the trouble started.....The landlord would not let them keep me inside so they put me in a pen outside.  This MIGHT have been ok except that there were these things with horns (goats) running around in a pasture not 15 feet from me!  What is a bored girl to do??!?!?  I kept breaking out and chasing them. I wasn't going to hurt them.  I just loved to see them run from me.  The landlord said if they did not get rid of me he was going to shoot me.  So....here I am homeless again.  If you let me be inside with you I promise I won't chase your other pets with horns!  \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have!

DOB: 12/01/12 Approx Weight: 75 Lbs\nAdoption Fee: $150 includes a 2 week trial to ensure everyone's happiness!\n\nAre you looking for a Sweet, gentle, senior who is very handsome? Then I might just be the guy for you!!!\nI am completely housebroken. I don't enjoy being crated, but I am really well behaved in the house and free roam at my foster home. I do well with other dogs I have met in foster so far, but should be fed separately as I tend to really not want other dogs around me while I munch on my food. I am a really loving guy and would be so happy just relaxing on the couch while my humans watch TV.\nWhen I came to FKR I had happy tail.... because I was always wagging it and hitting it on all objects in my way which made it bleed on the end. I had to have my tail amputated and feel much better now. I am strong on a leash and would benefit from obedience classes and a harness. A fenced in yard is required for me please.\n\nI have been neutered, vaccinated, heartworm tested negative, wormed and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting me, please complete the adoption application located at www.furrykidsrefuge.org/adoptadog and a dedicated volunteer will get back to you as soon as possible.\nFurry Kids' Refuge is in need of good quality dog and puppy food with meat as the first ingredient. You can drop off donations at our weekly adoption events at the Lee's Summit Petco (1860 NW Chipman Road, Lee's Summit, MO), Saturdays only from Noon to 4:00 p.m. Donations are tax deductible as allowed by law.\nWould you like to foster a Furry Kid? Furry Kids' Refuge will supply the food & vet care while you supply the basic house rules & love.......win-win for all!! Just visit our website http://www.furrykidsrefuge.org/category/fostering/ for more information. Thanks for your support!",

He loves to play tug and fetch and get his excited growls going.  He also loves to eat! He currently eats a raw diet, as well as raw marrow bones and treats. Cucumber, carrots, and romaine lettuce are his favorite vegetables, but he\u2019ll take any dog friendly snack you\u2019re offering! \n\nStu requires a predictable lifestyle, with no children. He has had a few incidents of aggression in the past, where he has bitten people on the arm or hand. It is usually related to resource guarding, and he seems uncomfortable in large crowds. An experienced, compassionate, and dedicated owner is essential for Stu to feel safe. \n\nStu would do well with a single person or couple who do not frequently have children over. He is crate trained and does well in the crate during times where he needs a safe space away from the action. \n\nStu\u2019s Temperament \n\u2022\tVery sweet, snuggly, and affectionate\n\u2022\tLoves to play, growls excitedly while playing \n\u2022\tObedient \n\u2022\tFood motivated\n\u2022\tExcited to see you but calms quickly, rarely jumps, if ever\n\u2022\tLow prey drive \n\u2022\tLoves to be at home, on walks with his humans, or running around  \n\nStu\u2019s Training \n\u2022\tObedience \n\u2022\tGood recall\n\u2022\tCrate trained\n\u2022\tE-collar trained\n\u2022\tSome muzzle training\n\nOwner Suitability\n\u2022\tExperienced with large breeds  \n\u2022\tAble to put him in situations where he will be successful\n\u2022\tExperienced in handling dogs who have shown some aggression in the past\n\u2022\tAble show affection as well as set appropriate boundaries \n\u2022\tFenced in yard or other appropriate boundaries\n\nTo apply or ask questions about Stu please contact stuart.ottawa@gmail.com \n",

            "description": "Morgan is a big boy weighing in at 100 pounds!  He is quite handsome and is estimated to be between the age of 1-3 years old. \n\nHe is very connecting and craves closeness, he is just happy to be by you.  Morgan is all loose, wiggly and outgoing too, just a silly boy.  He will definitely need a fun, active home with a lot of playtime and walks though, as he has a lot of energy.  He absolutely loves toys, so he would appreciate it if his new home could maybe have a few of those!  \n\nIt would be wonderful if his new family could work on some basic obedience with him, he knows sit, but he is in need of leadership and someone to set limits.  Morgan really needs an experienced adopter, this sweet guy has just never been taught how to conduct himself properly.  He doesn't seem to realize his size and strength.  Morgan would also do best in a home where any children were at least 13 years old, he can be a bit mouthy with toys and jumpy for attention.  It wouldn't hurt if he had a little help with losing a few pandemic pounds too, which we can all understand!  \n\nWe also have exciting news to share about Morgan and 3 other dogs at our rescue. They are participating in a Teacher's Pet program in which they travel twice a week to Crossroads, an at youth risk center, and are paired with a youth. They will be working with our pups on some obedience training and giving them some much needed one on one time. What a wonderful program, we are so happy about it and thrilled for our dogs.\n\nIf you are interested in Morgan and are at least 21 years old, please fill out an application at K9stray.com and we will be in touch. \n\n\n",

            "description": "Cereza / Female / 5 Months / 27 lbs / Street Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Cereza! Cereza is described by her fosters as an oversized lap dog, who loves to be as close as possible to her people! She will roll over for belly rubs every time she thinks there\u2019s a chance for one. She loves to be a part of her pack and does best when her canine pals and humans are near. Her puppy cuteness comes out when she boops things with her nose to figure out what they are. Still very much a puppy, she is playful, loving and is excited everyday to explore the world around her!\n\nWith new people, Cereza can be timid and may chose to stay in her own space. She takes time to realize people aren\u2019t a threat but she wants to make new friends. Once she warms up she will come over to give gentle kisses. She knows a dog lover - and warms up much quicker. Potential adopters should have realistic expectations when meeting her and building a relationship with her.\n\nCereza is gentle with all children, but she likes when they respect her space. She has been known to bark at come children if they move too quickly or take her things (toys). She is never aggressive but given she is just 5 months, proper socialization will be essential for her success. Her forever family will need to find ways to create positive social experiences and confidence meeting new people. Once she trusts children, she wants nothing more than to their best friend for life.\n\nFirst thing in the morning, Cereza gets a potty break and then tries to go right back to sleep on the couch. She is walked every 2-3 hours and will go up to 9 hours (at night) without a break. She never marks but she will have accidents if her humans are not paying attention to her signals. She is still potty training and will need to continue in her forever home!\n\nShe is very fearful of loud noises so she needs to be safely secured at all times while outside. She is timid and stubborn on leash, but walks much better when she is part of a pack. When walking one on one, she will generally chose to do her business and their usher her humans back inside. Although she loves other dogs she may take time to warm up to them. Once she feels safe, she will happily approach and play with other dogs.\nCereza is very smart and she has already learned sit. She is currently learning paw and stay! Further obedience and trick training has been great for her confidence overall.\n\nCereza\u2019s ideal home would be outside of the city, so she can learn to be more confident outside. She would love to have a fully fenced backyard to play or do her business; but its not essential if her humans are home to work with her potty schedule. She would absolutely love to have another dog to follow around and boost her confidence.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Cereza please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nCereza\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

            "description": "This little ball of fun is Mobley. He has been with PawsUp since early Dec. He came to us covered in mange and missing most of his fur, but it is really starting to fill in now!  The mange is gone (and was not of the contagious variety).  He will have a full coat soon and man is he cute.  His personality shines.  He is a happy boy with lots of love to give.  Mobley is a 5 month old MinPin mix, at best guess. \n\nThis little guy is the best. He makes me laugh every.single.day!!  You know that friend that sees the good in everyone and wants everyone around them to be happy?  That\u2019s Mobley!!  You know those dogs that spend more time on their back 2 legs than all 4 and you see them bopping up and down trying to see things twice as high as them?  That\u2019s Mobley!!  \nHe is the happiest little guy you\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s loving, gives never ending kisses, he sits for treats, but then gets so excited, that he has to help you give him the treat with his paws. He is doing better with his potty training, but still needs positive reinforcement and lots of treats!!\n\nMobley sleeps all night (in our bed). He is not a fan of the crate, so he would do best in a home where his people are home a majority of the time. He loves all the dogs in his foster home and loves people, but is hesitant at first. If his foster home pups aren\u2019t into playing, he entertains himself. He loves his toys!!  When he\u2019s really into playing, he gets a little crazy and the gremlin in him comes out. He makes the cutest little gremlin noises!!\n\nTo be considered the first step is to apply here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton \nWe are located in Joliet Illinois and require adopters be within a 100 mile radius to adopt. If your app is picked we will be in touch by phone to set up a private meet.  If the dog is adopted we will post the adoption pic. Information on fees can be found here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/",

Jack enjoys people and affection but tends to be bossy with other dogs and has an alpha personality, so we think he'd enjoy being the only dog in the home. He will require a quiet, dog savvy family without young kids and with the patience to allow him to explore new surroundings on his own time. We are estimating he is apx. 3 years old.\n\nThank you for showing interest in our dogs, however due to the recent influx of applications and emails we ask that you avoid sending emails asking if: a listed dog is still available, if we received your application, or if we have additional photos (we always post whatever we have). Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. You may call 559-393-1946 between 6PM and 9PM if you have additional questions AFTER SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment. \n",

His rescuer was told he had a doggie friend, but he was no where to be found. This sweet boy is so gentle and loving. He enjoys car rides and walks well on a leash.\n\nBuddie was born around 9-2016 and currently weighs 47 lbs., he is neutered, current on vaccines and micro-chipped. Buddie can be protective of the ones he loves, we need an owner who will be the alpha in their relationship. When company comes over, Buddie will need to be put away or wear a muzzle, to ensure he doesn't fail.  \n\nBuddie is currently in Houston boarding facility waiting for a home of his own. We have adopted to many very happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month.\n\nPlease fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com to find out more about this handsome short legged dude!",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nLebron is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~8 months \nWeight: ~39lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be on a strict schedule\nCrate trained: \nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Friendly with kids, but can be mouthy/jumpy/humpy - so recommended for older kids only\nIdeal home: An active home that can work on training as he is an energetic and adolescent pup!\n\nIf Lebron could spend 80% of his time outside - he would! This young guy loves to play with all the dogs and humans alike! He is a young dog - so lots of good energy and will need an adopter that can exhaust his exuberance in healthy ways. He thrives when given jobs to do such as enrichment toys. Roll some treats up in a paper towel roll, or sprinkle some snacks on the ground and let him \"find it! Lebron would thrive with a dog pal either in his home or access to nearby friends/doggy daycare. When he gets overly amped up, or if he gets bored, his adolescent tendencies may appear. He also loves to chew and may need to be redirected to the right items to chomp on. This kid has been learning a lot in foster care and would love an adopter committed to working on his training.\n\nLebron's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date (3/4/21) and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Haiku gets along with both dogs and cats. She is extremely mild mannered and barely makes a peep.\u00a0 Haiku is potty trained and sleeps through the night.\u00a0 She thrives with a consistent schedule.\u00a0 Although she is older, Haiku is in great spirits and in generally good health.\u00a0 Her main age related issue is arthritis in her spine and hips.\u00a0 For this reason, she will need to remain on an aid, such as Rimadyl, for the remainder of her life.\u00a0 Will you give this girl a chance to show you she\u2019s worth it?\n\nNote: Haiku is a bit on the skinny side currently, but continues to gain!\u00a0 With her being older and having arthritis, gaining weight is something that takes time.\u00a0 She has made great progress, but due to her age, we felt it was more important for her to find forever vs spending months gaining weight in her foster home.\n\nPlease visit halfwaythererescue@gmail.com for information on meeting and/or adopting Haiku!",

            "description": "Meet FatBoi. He had a difficult start after coming to us from a hoarding situation, but has made a lot of progress and is doing well with people and other dogs under our care. He will still require a patient home with dog experience and no young kids to help introduce him to \"real world\" things like walking on a leash and living indoors, but we are confident that with the right family he will continue to thrive. FatBoi is apx. 3 years old and has a moderately active energy level. \n\nThank you for showing interest in our dogs, however due to the recent influx of applications and emails we ask that you avoid sending emails asking if: a listed dog is still available, if we received your application, or if we have additional photos (we always post whatever we have). Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. You may call 559-393-1946 between 6PM and 9PM if you have additional questions AFTER SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment. \n",

He had alot of contact w/ his owner, was trained to do darling things, but his owner has died. Check out the picture of Jody making  himself comfortable w/ his foster (on the sofa on him!) He is house & crate trained.  I hope to help him survive the health needs (he is heartworm positive & may have cancer, the neuter is being biopsied..did not spread~! )  Jody is a sweet, quiet, unassuming hound dog !!\n**\nThank you for your interest in our rescues ! Events most every weekend to meet some. All may be met by appointment w/ approved application. Facebook posts who will attend (currant week).\u00a0 Available dogs, donation button(we are non-profit) & links to adopt/volunteer  www.lovemuttsrescue.org . We will email you our process & fees. When one is in \"foster to adopt\", they are taken off our website, but may be relisted w/in 2 weeks, if not a final adoption. Blessings, The Love Mutts Rescue Team",

His rescuer was told he had a doggie friend, but he was no where to be found. This sweet boy is so gentle and loving. He enjoys car rides and walks well on a leash.\n\nBuddie was born around 9-2016 and currently weighs 47 lbs., he is neutered, current on vaccines and micro-chipped. Buddie can be protective of the ones he loves, we need an owner who will be the alpha in their relationship. When company comes over, Buddie will need to be put away or wear a muzzle, to ensure he doesn't fail.  \n\nBuddie is currently in Houston boarding facility waiting for a home of his own. We have adopted to many very happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month.\n\nPlease fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com to find out more about this handsome short legged dude!",

            "description": "This puppy is in Tennessee. Adoption Donation $250 if picked up in TN, $300 plus transport fee for out of state adoptions.\n\nWonderful puppy Wren is a fun and active 5-month-old, Pit Bull Terrier / Australian Kelpie mix (best guess). She is 23 pounds and a fantastic canine companion. Wren is seeking an energetic family where she can go for walks, hikes, and lots of adventures. She is working on basic training in her foster home, and is treat motivated, so a continuation of this would be ideal. Wren is already crate and house trained, and is learning sit. She is a big fan of toys, and says any and all kinds will do. Wren has a stunning look that is quite unique, and we think she will be a gorgeous adult dog. She is good with other pets when given a slow and proper intro, so a playmate of her similar temperament and size would be okay for her new home. If you think you might be a perfect fit for Wren, apply to adopt today!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

Pre-Adoption means getting your app in, approved and paying the adoption fee to secure the ride. His adoption fee is $450 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too! If you are interested in pre-adoption you can click the link here or copy/paste and fill out the app to get started: https://form.jotform.com/PNWdogs/ttrt-pnw-ap",

            "description": "Meet Otis. He came to us from a hoarding situation and has been slowly learning to trust people and enjoy affection. Otis likes to play with other pups but he tends to have a rough style of play (lots of chase) that is overwhelming for certain dogs. He is shy with new people but is highly food motivated and has a moderately active energy level. Otis needs a quiet home with dog experience and without young children that will be patient with him as he learns how to be a household companion! He is apx. 1.5 years old. \n\nThank you for showing interest in our dogs, however due to the recent influx of applications and emails we ask that you avoid sending emails asking if: a listed dog is still available, if we received your application, or if we have additional photos (we always post whatever we have). Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. You may call 559-393-1946 between 6PM and 9PM if you have additional questions AFTER SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment.",

He loves other dogs and easily makes friends at the dog park. At home he would do well having another doggie sibling who loves to play. Clay is a little shy with humans at first but just needs time to warm up and know you are his friend. Once he does, cuddles and belly rubs are his favorite. Clay is almost potty trained and improving on his leash manners. J\nust take one look into this handsome boy's golden eyes to know he would make a wonderful addition to a lucky family.

Some have tan fur and some have red coats. They came to us a little shy but have warmed right up with the TLC they are getting in their awesome foster families! They are big, playful puppies will be good-sized dogs when grown and will need fenced yards. They are very loving and affectionate and will make good family dogs with gentle children over 7 because they are such big puppies. Let's find the happy endings for these sweet pups!\n\nFor more information about this animal and our adoption process, please visit our website to fill out an adoption application: https://www.homecomingsrescue.org/adoption-process.",

Some have tan fur and some have red coats. They came to us a little shy but have warmed right up with the TLC they are getting in their awesome foster families! They are big, playful puppies will be good-sized dogs when grown and will need fenced yards. They are very loving and affectionate and will make good family dogs with gentle children over 7 because they are such big puppies.

            "description": "Sayan is a happy-go-lucky Husky mix. He loves going on walks just as much as he loves to lay around. He is playful, but not huge on puppy-play. He is not crate trained and does not do well in all metal ones, but does well being left out. He is a very loving and affectionate boy who appreciates good snuggles and belly rubs. Probably best with older kids and older more laid-back other dogs in the home. He is a heart on his sleeve pup and attaches to his people pretty easily. He has some separation anxiety, but should be an easy fix.

Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** No obvious health issues found during vet exam *****\n\nTemperament: -- Shy at first but warms up after you hold her for a little while. An adopter will have to be willing to give her a few days to trust before she blossoms into a sweetie. She uses a dog door very well but she doesn't like to be outside without you. She likes to sleep in your bed and she's quiet all night long. She's easy to bathe, brush and blow dry. We are working on leash training. She was a picky eater at first but maybe she was just too fearful to eat. She doesn't have the problem anymore.\n\nWhere did she come from: Owner surrendered when she was evicted from her home.\n\nAdoption: ***** $433.00 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 12 lbs.\nApproximate DOB: 11/27/2013\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

There will be an adoption fee of $200 to be donated to EAPL.\n\nWillow is a 4-year-old white shepherd mix that is about the cutest dog you have ever seen. Our family rescued her about 3 years ago and we live in Evergreen. She loves her humans and is very playful, energetic, and super smart, so she learns tricks very quickly. She also loves to snuggle and play with her toys (she is particularly fond of playing tuggie). Unfortunately, Willow does not get along with other dogs or cats in the home and needs to be an only dog. She is also an anxious dog, so she will need lots of love and patience. It breaks our heart to have to rehome Willow as she is a part of our family, and we want to ensure we find her a loving home where she can thrive. Willow is spayed and weighs about 45 pounds. Her shots are up to date. If you are interested in learning more about Willow, please call Annette at 713.416.9563 or email\n\njamm0808@gmail.com\n\nwith your contact information.

Please DO NOT CONTACT EAPL about courtesy listings. The pet owner/rescue/shelter and new owner shall make all arrangements on transferring the pet, information on history, vaccines, etc.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Willow, please call Annette at 713.416.9563 or email\n\njamm0808@gmail.com\n\nwith your contact information. There will be an adoption fee of $200 to be donated to EAPL.\n\nWillow is a 4-year-old white shepherd mix that is about the cutest dog you have ever seen. Our family rescued her about 3 years ago and we live in Evergreen. She loves her humans and is very playful, energetic, and super smart, so she learns tricks very quickly. She also loves to snuggle and play with her toys (she is particularly fond of playing tuggie). Unfortunately, Willow does not get along with other dogs or cats in the home and needs to be an only dog. She is also an anxious dog, so she will need lots of love and patience. It breaks our heart to have to rehome Willow as she is a part of our family, and we want to ensure we find her a loving home where she can thrive. Willow is spayed and weighs about 45 pounds. Her shots are up to date. If you are interested in learning more about Willow, please call Annette at 713.416.9563 or email\n\njamm0808@gmail.com\n\nwith your contact information.

She is very smart and food motivated so she should be highly trainable. Laney is about 2 years old, up to date on vaccinations, flea treated, wormed, heartworm negative, lymes positive (currently being treated for the lymes), and microchipped. She will be spayed soon and will then be available for adoption. She is good with most dogs but can resource guard (only with dogs, not people). Laney is a wonderful dog and will make a great loving companion for a family willing to help her gain her faith back in people. Training/socialization class is a requirement for her adoption. **Applications will not be screened if they do not meet adoption requirements. **",

Sheldon is itchier than an average dog and may require long-term care by a dermatologist. The adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org.

I am 11 months old and 30-35 lbs (and growing!) but in such a short time I haven't been treated very nice by humans. I came from a home that liked to keep lots of doggies but not care for them. As a result I have been working on growing my hair, gaining some weight, and confidence back. I've been doing a good job of that with my foster the last month; went from 22 lbs to at least 30!!. I am a sweet pup and with a little time and patience will be ok.  My fur foster sibling Maddie, my gosh I like her she is really helping me. Because of that,  a home with a second dog IS A MUST for me.\n\nI sleep in the crate ok. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night and then crept in foster mom's bed and cuddled up with her until the morning. I am a sweet baby! Oh and I am fine with cats!",

PLEASE CONTACT THE OWNER DIRECTLY AT Ladonna102460@gmail.com.\t\n\t\nGabe is a happy, healthy, young Australian Shepherd/Husky mix who needs to find a new home.  His current owner must move and the new landlord does not allow dogs.  Gabe is not yet 2 years old, he weighs 60 pounds, and he is neutered and up to date on all of his vaccines.  He has a nice blue merle coat, partially blue eyes and a full tail!  Gabe is super smart and he knows a lot of obedience commands.  He is also housebroken, crate-trained, loves to ride in the car and he walks very nicely on leash.   \nGabe loves people and is comfortable with adults and children.  He is a medium Velcro, medium-to-high energy young guy who loves to play fetch, chase a ball around the pool, play with toys, go for walks, have his feet washed, you name it!  He just loves people and attention!  Gabe has had no exposure to other dogs other than a very small dog in the home, and he has not been introduced to cats.\nThe ideal home for Gabe is fun and active, shared with someone who has the time to spend with him and who is looking for a forever best friend.  A fenced yard is important and children over the age of 10 are welcome.  If Gabe sounds like YOUR new best friend, please contact his owner directly at Ladonna102460@gmail.com.  Gabe currently lives in Pilot Mountain, NC.\n",

Copy and paste the link to access the sign-up genius for an appointment: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet for dogs \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to adoptioncenter@homewardtrails.org \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nMeet Lucy! She came to Homeward Trails from Fayette County, WV where she was originally found as a stray. After not being reclaimed by her previous owners, she was lucky to go to a foster who took great care of her and helped learn more about her. \n\nShe is a playful gal, a herding type who likes to run and chase other dogs and toys. She is best with another active and higher energy dog, and best in a home without cats or little animals. Isn't she adorable? Make an appointment to meet her this weekend! \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center staff\nLocation: Adoption Center\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

She is extremely food motivated and, because of that, easy to train; her behavior is already improving and she is learning new tricks with the help of tasty treats. She is house broken and on her way to being crate trained. Frankie wants to be a lap dog and is never far from a human to pet her and rub her ears. She is a playful girl and gaining confidence at the park and in the home. She loves to snooze on the couch and follow her human around. She is untested with cats but excellent with other dogs, men and kids. She will be an excellent pet.\n\nFrankie will need a home with another confident dog.\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Lauren T\nLocation: Foster\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog/puppy is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\n We also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters.

Discount if adopted together\nContact: Mickyrescues@gmail.com\n\nThese two adorable gals were welcomed into rescue after their owner moved into a senior living home.  They are a little confused right now, but they are slowly settling in to their new environment.  They will both be seen by the vet this week.  They will surely need to have some dental care and will likely lose all their teeth.  They are crate trained and are quiet sweet girls.  They will potty outside but have had accidents in the house.  We are not sure if they are bonded, but given the amount of time they have been together, we would like for them to be adopted together.  More information to come soon.\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "TILLY is affectionate, smart, playful and friendly.  She has good play skills and she's good with dogs and cats. She loves to be cuddled and petted and play. Tilly was born on one of the reservations we work with. Under her beautiful black coat is an even more beautiful tan undercoat :-) She's eager to learn, good candidate for agility.\n\nHer adoption fee includes her spaying, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, microchip. She was born Sept 16, 2020.\n\n** Do you live in our adopting area? ** Do you have another young playful friendly male dog of similar adult size? ** If yes to both questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Puppies MUST adopt to families that have another young friendly playful dog of similar breed size when grown. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n",

Let me tell you a little about me...I am about 10 years old, I weigh appx 20lbs, I am good with kids and other dogs and I think cats too but I would have to ask my foster mom what she considers good. I am mostly housebroken but still learning. I hate being crated and I will definitely let you know that. I do much better with a baby gate in a room if you don't want to to roam the house at first. I have old man issues...I have arthritis and need pain meds when the weather is bad. It's actually best if I have them all the time for awhile. They aren't expensive and they make me feel so much better. I had a horrible ear infection but that is gone now. My foster mom says I am the cutest dog ever created, there's not an aggressive bone in my body, I am a very happy boy and I love to eat. I also love watching TV.. and snuggling on the couch, of course.\n\nIf you would like to meet Hugo send is an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can. \n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam.",

Discount if adopted together\nContact: Mickyrescues@gmail.com\n\nThese two adorable gals were welcomed into rescue after their owner moved into a senior living home.  They are a little confused right now, but they are slowly settling in to their new environment.  They will both be seen by the vet this week.  They will surely need to have some dental care and will likely lose all their teeth.  They are crate trained and are quiet sweet girls.  They will potty outside but have had accidents in the house.  We are not sure if they are bonded, but given the amount of time they have been together, we would like for them to be adopted together.  More information to come soon.\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

Dunkin is a total charmer and ladies man (just ask the ladies at our vet who were fawning all over him), he loves other dogs, and doesn't mind cats that don't mind him! We have Dunkin on a strict diet and activity schedule as he weighs in at 95 lbs and needs to lose at least 20 of those. But we love a chonky boy and are thrilled to help get him back to his healthiest and most fit self! He needs a family that is as dedicated to keeping him active as they are giving him endless love. Message us here, text, or call us at 904-392-3416 to learn more about Dunkin and his needs!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.\n\nBe sure to read ALL information provided.\n\nA PET IS FOR LIFE -\nTHINK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT!\n\nKHUSHI was saved by a small rescue based in Kabul, Afghanistan. She had a severe case of pyometra (an infection of the womb) her womb was so swollen that it was starting to literally fall out of her. Emergency, life saving surgery was made and this lucky girl is alive due to the care and expertise of the rescue and veterinarians in Kabul.\n\nOnce recovered Khushi and her friend Noqrah were flown into the US where they waited in a boarding facility for transport up to Maine. They arrived at GaDaH on 25th January 2021.\n\nKhushu is spayed, rabies, core vaccines, de-wormed, heartworm and tick disease tested negative, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of her export/import examination she weighed she weighed around 43.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 15 March 2018.\n\nWe cannot say for sure what breed she is, so we expect families to do their own research on her look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for her needs.\n\nFor all that this sweet girl has been through, she is doing amazing, to think just over a week ago she was in Afghanistan, endured 48 hours traveling to US, then in a boarding facility for a few days and then driven for 1.5 days up to Maine and is a happy-go-lucky girl.\n\nKhushi is a dog that you can not look at and not smile, she is so happy, she is so loving and affectionate, she has beautiful thick, soft fur and loves to cuddle and give kisses. Khushi lived with some female dogs whilst in Kabul and travelled to the rescue with Noqrah a young female dog and was great. At the rescue she was in the house and did seem to be a little protective of her area and would bark at the other dogs. This didn't seem to be an aggressive manner, but more of warning them to keep out of her space - which the dogs respected. After a couple of days I relocated her to the back sectioned off part of the kennel communal area, she has more space, a sofa, I put the TV on so she can used to that and she can interact with the other rescue dogs through the gate panel.\n\nThis girl is beyond a sweetheart, she would be happy to be the only dog, or with a bit of slow introductions share her new family and home with another dog, I think the rescue with so many dogs it is somewhat overwhelming for her, which again considering all she has been through is to be expected.\n\nIn Kabul, Khushi was around cats and she was great, however, we cannot say how she would be around livestock. She has a very sweet demeanor and deserves the best life has to offer.\n\nWe are looking for a family that go on hikes, walks, treks, adventures, to the beach, the lake, anywhere and everywhere that is fun and would give this beauty a wonderful fun filled life. She is going to need training, she is not fully house-trained, but does use pee-pads if they are put down - she just needs to learn to let her family know she needs to go outside. Khushi\nis going to be a medium/large high energy dog and so she needs an active family who already have an adventurous and active lifestyle they can incorporate her into. She is a smart girl and so training and continued mental stimulation is also very important to make sure she gets the healthy, both physical and mental lifestyle that she needs and deserves.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nKhushi is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $750, the higher adoption fee is to help cover the costs of her going through all the import/export certifications and the cost of her flight, boarding and transport to the rescue. This fee, obviously doesn't come close to covering these costs, but is a help.\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing. Animal Welfare is deemed essential in the US, but quarantine rules entering back into Canada must be followed.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 1-2 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend.\n\nClick here to watch a video of KHUSHI - Afghan pup.",

            "description": "8lb, 5 year old Grant is a fun loving, energetic, spicy little boy. With a short black and tan coat, ears with a mind of their own, and enough personality for 3 dogs, we guess he is a mix of chihuahua, miniature pinscher, dachshund, terrier, or something in between.\n\nGrant is most often found bouncing around the house gathering up any toy in sight, or relentlessly asking the other dogs to play. He acts like a puppy and gets along with tolerant dogs that match his energy.\n\nOriginally a stray with an unknown past, he can be unsure of new people and will mouth or nip at hands and feet that move too quickly towards him, and although this behavior is mild at the moment, we strongly urge his new family to enroll in some positive reinforcement obedience and behavior training. We do not believe he will be a match for homes with children or cats at this time, but he has the potential to be a great family dog with the right guidance. Currently, he will bite out of fear when being picked up, but if someone sits on the ground he will often crawl into their lap and allow being picked up that way. He just needs time and consistency to overcome his fear.\n\nGrant would make a great agility, flyball, or barn hunt dog - he definitely needs plenty of exercise and a job!\n\nHe is a healthy boy - up to date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, and has had a recent dental with full bloodwork. All he needs now is a great adopter with the energy to match!\n\nPlease fill out an application and we will call you once approved to set up a meet and greet. If you have any questions, email director@canineestates.com or call 727-412-0558",

Sidney had some benign facial papilloma tumors which we had removed and although her fur is almost completely regrown, her pictures do not do her justice.\n\nShe is a little bit anxious when left alone, starting to show some signs of dementia, but friendly with all people and some mellow dogs; she would likely be fine with kids and cats as well. We would not place her with younger dogs as she has some balance issues and does not take kindly to rough housing. Sidney had to have an eye removed under our care, and has a cataract in her remaining eye that is beginning to interfere with her vision, but she gets around very well, and her nose works just fine(she is VERY food motivated)! She has a slight heart murmur that does not require medication yet (common with older dogs) and has had full bloodwork with a recent dental.\n\nAll she needs now is a comfortable bed and lots of love fur-ever. She is also available as a hospice foster, where you provide love and a home, and we will take care of her medical expenses for her remaining years.\n\nVisits by appointment for approved applicants only, call 727-412-0558 or Email director@canineestates.com",

Lobito was abandoned in Ajijic together with a female cattle dog and then rescued.\n\nThis handsome fellow is good-tempered and gentle; he walks well on leash and loves to be taken care of and adored. He is great with other dogs, not sure about cats but squirrels take all his attention. A home with a fenced outdoor area would be ideal for Lobito to play and run around. He will be a great addition to any loving family. Are you ready to welcome Lobito into your life?\n\n***THE DOG IS CURRENTLY IN MEXICO.

He is about a year old and is a German Sheperd/Black Lab mix! \n\n \n\nBefore considering adding Sora to your family, please note that KPAL Rescue has a mandatory adoption process in place which includes a background check and a home visit. More information on our adoption process can be found in our pinned post, please read that (and this adoption post) in their entirety - our process cannot be waived.\n\n \n\nSora is a sweet, young boy that would love to have a big yard to run around in. He would do best in a home that could give him structure; a schedule with daily physical and mental stimulation would help this boy thrive. Sora is leash-trained, potty-trained, and knows basic commands. When left unattended, Sora does best in a kennel as he has shown signs of being destructive when left home alone to free roam. He would need further training if his family would like him to free roam the house. Sora does well with most dogs, has never met cats, and has been great with children! \n\n \n\nSora is being by fostered by Karen, we appreciate her so much! \n\n \n\nIf youre interested in adopting Sora, our adoption process is outlined in our pinned post and on our website: www.kpalrescue.org/pet-adoption/.

As always, donations are also very appreciated.

I know exactly where to go pee and poop if you take me often! Not sure how big I'll be but I'm from a litter of 12 so I know I won't be small! I recently discovered toys and love them!! Sticks are really cool to eat too. Please don't adopt me if you don't have time or patience for me! I am super sweet and will need lots of attention \n\nJessie James is a female Shepherd/Cattle Dog mix puppy with estimated DOB of 12/1/20.",

Pearl is incredibly \"wiggly\" and her tail is always wagging. She has a lot of energy and will need adopters who are very active. We describe Pearl as an affectionate bulldozer, always ready to give massive hugs. Pearl seems to do well with most other dogs, but can be picky at times and she does not like cats. Pearl will give her whole heart to the perfect family and can't wait to enjoy her new life out of the shelter! She is spayed and current on vaccinations and preventatives. For more information on Pearl and our adoption requirements, please give us a call at (209) 984 5489 or visit our website: www.hsotc.org.",

She walks great on a leash but since shes in her golden years she only needs a good walk or two a day. She does great with older kids and is fully house broken. She isnt being fostered with cats but her foster mom thinks shed be fine with them. \n\nHer fosters favorite thing is how she always follows the sun beams in the house to lay in them. \n\nIf you are interested in Nala please apply at https://www.nickelcitycaninerescue.org/adopt-a-dog or message the rescue if you are already pre-approved.",

He hasnt been around kids or cats in his foster home, but he is so sweet so we dont see that being a problem.

            "description": "Shelby is quite the velcro dog! She wants you to be near her person at all times, and she's always up cuddling and chin scratches. She gets along well other dogs and is excited to meet new people. Shelby is excellent on walks (loose leash the entire time) where she uses her hound nose to explore the outdoors. She doesn't seem to know what to do with toys, but she's very food motivated and will work at a puzzle toy to get treats out. Shelby is quiet and calm the entire time she is in the crate, and she knows \"sit\" and \"paw\". She is currently working with her foster mom on potty training. Shelby's favorite activities are snuggling, going for short walks, and following her humans around. If you are interested in meeting Shelby, please submit an appointment request here:\n\nhttps://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lsJ_8Hpq8k2OaDbCdJiGnZ0KUdNlMOxGs9o3MWhive1UOFRNUUhQMlFUSlM4UU04RUdEQ1dQNUFWTC4u\n\nCurrent weight: 55 pounds\nCurrent age: 2 years old",

We thank you for your understanding. The adoption application link is posted below and the adoption process is outlined on the website.  Animatch asks that you read the Adoptee\u2019s bio in its entirety before applying to ensure you meet the requirements for the dog.\n\nWell, hello there, I\u2019m Doe from Whapmagoostui and I rolled in with my two pups (Stag and Buck) who already have homes all lined up).  Guess what?  I\u2019m ready for my next big adventure.  No need to worry about me coming out of my shell \u2026. I\u2019m turbo charged and ready for some action.  I\u2019m an 80-lb dog who acts like a 10 lb pooch.  Because I am such an attention hog, I am always ready to launch myself at humans (in a friendly way, of course).   Animatch does not want to see anyone get bowled over or have their arm pulled out of its socket, so let\u2019s sign me up for obedience training using positive reinforcement asap. Show me a tasty treat and you will soon have my full attention.  Having a safe enclosed yard where I can get rid of some of my energy before my walk would be ideal.  I just need to find a loving home with patient people who will have the time and compassion to help me be the best dog that I can be.  Since I\u2019m not completely finished taking care of my pups, I have not been tested with other dogs.  But one thing I know for sure \u2026. no cats or small critters allowed in my house!  Kids should be older because until I get some training under my fur; they will spend a lot of time being knocked on their butts.  I am not a dog for the inexperienced and if you know Shepherds that would be even better.  If you\u2019re ready for a hilarious, fun-loving, huge bundle of joy then you\u2019ve got to meet this girl!  Fill in the Adoption Form and ask for Doe.\n\nNOT SUITABLE FOR APARTMENT/CONDO LIVING\n\nPlease share photos of Doe with your\nBreed:  German Shepherd\nSize:  Large (80 lbs)\nAge:  2 years\nGender:  Female\nGrooming:  Low\nEnergy:  High\nChildren:  12 and over\nCat friendly:  No\nDog friendly:  tbc\n\nTO APPLY FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE VISIT OUR WEB SITE: www.animatch.ca AND FILL THE APPLICATION ON LINE.\n*** calls and e-mails will not be answered ***",

I was turned in to an animal control facility when my owner was no longer able to care for me. This is what my foster mom says about me.....\n\nSergio is a 5 year old Chihuahua/doxie mix. Sergio weighs about 11-12 pounds. He is a very unique reddish brown. He is very sweet and loving. He is house trained if he is taken out regularly. In yucky weather, he sometimes prefers to be leash walked. He is learning to not fear the leash. It takes him a little time to warm up to a person but once he does, he will be the most loving and loyal companion ever! He likes to play spend his days playing with his stuffed toys and cuddling. He likes other dogs just fine but can also be an only as long as his isn't home alone all day every day.\n\n\nIf you would like to meet Sergio, please send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n His adoption donation pays for all vetting... neuter, microchip, all vaccinations, a heart worm test, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam",

We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico.

I have a funny personality and am full of love, all I want to do is give you all the kisses.

            "description": "Handsome Mr. Debo finds himself in-search of a new forever family of his own. Debo is 3 years old, and is THEE happiest and cuddliest pittie boy around! He loves his people (and loves to just be around them) so much that he smiles every time they come home for the day. He could spend hours on end just lounging on the couch, cuddling and napping (on the lap of his person, of course!) the day away. Debo also love, love, LOVES his toys! Although, it has been determined that he can typically only have hard/durable toys and chew toys...as he will destroy any other kinds of toys and attempt to eat them before his humans can get them away from him. One of Debos favorite pastimes is playing fetch, and he would love to have a fenced-in backyard where he could run freely and play fetch with his human to his hearts content! Because Debo can get pretty possessive over his balls/bones, and because he doesnt fancy sharing his toys (with other dogs and/or human strangers), we are recommending that he be the only dog in the home. He is currently in a home with other dogs, and has been in several scuffles over his unwillingness to share. We truly believe that he would thrive going to a home where he could be his humans one and only...to soak up all of the attention and live his best life. He also needs to go to a home either without children, or with children who are old enough to understand not to attempt to randomly take his toys away from him. Once he trusts people, he will drop and leave his toys/ball for his human friends when he is asked. Debo is completely potty-trained and crate-trained, knows his basic commands, and loves to just be in the presence of his humans. He typically does ok encountering other dogs (out on walks, etc.), but does need to be introduced to them slowly and in a controlled environment. He will also need to go to a cat-free home. Debo is such a special boy who deserves everything good that this world has to offerand we would love to find him a forever where he can be the apple of his persons eye. In return, he promises endless love and cuddles. Just ask for Debo! \n \nIf you are interested in adopting Debo, please submit a general application at https://newleashdogrescue.com/.\n \n**Debos $200 adoption fee includes his neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test, and microchip.",

His previous owner kicked him in the jaw and left it to get infected.  His jaw may have been broken at one time and he's currently getting a work up so that he has a great future. Despite his abuse Howdy is a really happy and very sweet young 12 month old boy.  He is a little unsure of new things at first but he is not fearful. He is a super playful and happy boy who loves to explore the toy box and pick out a favorite or two. He is a quick learner and willing to please.  He is good with dogs and cats.  He likes to have his ears rubbed and to sit by your side.  He is just a handsome little fellow and will make a gentle human a wonderful companion! He is full grown at 28 lbs.\nReviewing applications now. Apply at http://www.saveadog.org/applytoadopt.asp",

Sweet Kit was found as a stray on the streets of TN and a volunteer was trying to feed him to get him into rescue. He has a scar on his head that looks to be from a chemical burn or some kind of abuse he endured on the streets, yet he remains trusting of people and very loving. He was super friendly and was happy to go with the rescuer to get care. He has been loving life in foster care, getting regular meals, and getting love. Kit's foster mom says, \"Kit is a sweet ball of energy, he loves cuddling and will sit and lay down for treats. He likes to be outside but needs practice walking on a leash. He LOVES to play and run. His true personality comes out when he feels safe.\" His perfect fit would be a family he can adventure with! He temp tested well with other dogs, but is currently in a foster home by himself. He is house trained and crate trained. Kit is fully vetted and neutered and ready to go on his next adventure! Kids ages 8+ recommended so he doesn't knock anyone over. He would love an active family or a fenced in yard. To apply to adopt Kit, please go to www.charliescrusaders.org",

I am suitable for single family homes with yards.\n\n\nMeet Kaleb he is around 18 months old. A neutered Aussie/ mix. He is a fun-loving boy and a total sweetheart. Kaleb spent 4 weeks training full-time with the CCI prison training program and has lots of tricks to show you! They taught him how to walk on a leash, basic tricks like sit-stay-down, cool tricks like five bucks (one paw), ten bucks (two paws), roll over, (Hes still working on that one.) . Kaleb is crate trained and house trained. He will make an amazing addition to a loving family. Kaleb loves to play but can settle down and just hang out too. Slow introductions to new humans and other dogs are recommended. But once he knows you he loves any attention. He loves to have his belly and ears rubbed. Kaleb is super smart and is continuing to learn new things every day. He is working on going potty in one specific area in the yard. Sometimes he forgets but it wont take him long to remember. Kaleb would thrive in a home with older children (older than 10 years old) who can work with him on his training and love and play with him. As foster parents we love Kaleb. But feel he needs a bigger more active family to meet his needs. \n\nHe's athletic, so he needs at least a 6 ft fence--anything smaller, and he'll jump it.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR PUPPY ADOPTION:\n1) PUPPIES WILL ONLY BE PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL, DOGS. This helps integrate the dog into your household easier by giving the pup a mentor.\n2) In addition to the youthful playful dog, someone MUST also be home at least part of the day. Please do not apply for a puppy if you are gone 8-10 hours a day. It is not a good situation for you or the puppy.\n3) You must have plans in place to socialize your puppy properly.\n4) Our puppies are not livestock dogs. They must be family pets that are allowed inside the home.\n\nPlease watch this short video which demonstrates how puppies learn polite behavior from their adult dog mentors. https://youtu.be/R6N8STRl2aI\n\nMeet Duffy! She is a sweet young thing who loves life! Born about May 2020, Duffy is a well-proportioned pocket Pyr, weighing about 55 pounds. Full of energy and curiosity, she will keep you on your toes as she gets comfortable in your home.\n\nDuffy gets along well with dogs of all sizes, especially if they're playful! Duffy would probably do better in a multiple pet home at this time, because she loves to play. She must have a large, playful doggy companion in her forever home.\n\nShe has not been tested with cats.\n\nDuffy can be a tad stubborn when she's afraid, and she's perfected passive resistance! But when she gets over her fear, she's a loving companion with a willingness to please.\n\nBeing a little on the smaller side, she'll sometimes need help loading into the car, but she rides well once inside.\n\nDuff-Duff enjoys the merits of a good water puddle, so if fastidiousness is a must for you, she may not be a good match. But if you can overlook a little dirty fun, she'll make a wonderful addition to your family!\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

When he came in he had no manners and was deathly afraid of other dogs. We do believe he can overcome this with time, but for now, he will be in need of an only dog home. He just needs time and patience. You see, Moose is a 1-year-old chocolate lab pup born to an Amish Breeder. He was given to another young Amish man, because he had something wrong with his eye. The defect made him unsellable, however, it was just cherry eye that could be surgically fixed. He had the surgery and it was a complete success. We can just thank God this kid stepped up. Normally these pups are killed. No $$$...no worth! The fact that we have built a rapport with the Amish community saved this boy's life! One of our previous surrenders gave this young man our information. If you think you can give this boy everything he needs, applications are available on our website www.onedogatatime.us.",

            "description": "Gonza is a true lap dog who loves endless cuddles. She is three years old and an absolute sweetheart who is quiet and calm, with a very wiggly body and waggy tail when excited. She is likely a Beagle/Corgi + a decent mix of breeds and weighs about 30 lbs. Gonza is hesitant around strangers, but warms of quickly. From the first day she arrived she was friendly with our large breed dog, and enjoys his company, although she is not interested in playing with him. Gonza is 100% potty trained and sleeps quietly through the night at the foot of the bed. She also does well on walks and car rides. Gonza is looking forward to a loving home where she can snuggle and be your constant companion.\n\nWe would like Gonza's adopter to have a fully fenced in yard - and likely she would do better in a home with kids 10+. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adoption fee of $400 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! And that is the BEST breed!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup!  (the Facebook application will not load from a mobile phone, you must be on a desktop or laptop for this)\n\n*please note that we are a foster home based rescue and we do home visits as part of the adoption process - we are unable to adopt to families who live outside of the Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Thank you for your understanding.",

Nina is small, weighing just 24 pounds - she needs someone to love and to love her.\nIf you would like to meet me, please visit our website and complete the pre-adoption application. Once it has been processed then we can make a date to get together!\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm tested (if over 2 years old), vaccinated, dewormed, flea and tick treated, microchipped and more before adoption. Our adoption policies include: Application, Vet Reference, Landlord approval & Criminal Background Check. We do not do same day adoptions. We request that you call for an appointment after your application has been approved to come and visit the dog of your choice. If you have a dog currently, you should bring him/her along to meet the new dog so we can see how everyone interacts. Please visit our website for additional information.

            "description": "NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS\n\nAnimal Profile: Sonny is an adorable, 3 year old Chihuahua/dachshund mix. He will be joining us from California on January 10th. He was in the shelter with another female Chihuahua that we also will be bringing to Seattle. Sonny, like most little dogs, was pretty overwhelmed at the shelter (can we blame him?). He is very happy to be in safe hands now. Sonny is still a bit overwhelmed, and will need someone to go slow with him at first so he can decompress and settle in. We have no doubt his personality will quickly flourish in foster care! We will post more info as we get to know him.\n\nSeattle Foster Update: Sonny is really settling in well in his foster home! He was shy when he arrived (as expected) but is getting more comfortable each day. He is a total snuggle bug, and often finds his way into his foster's lap whenever he gets a chance. The outside world can still be a bit overwhelming for Sonny, so he has been skittish on walks around loud noises. Sonny would prefer a quieter environment, and an adopter who is committed to working on his training to help build his confidence. Sonny has been all about his humans when he is home, but when he has had a chance to play/interact with other dogs he has done great! He recently had a playdate with a playful puppy and they played great together. Sonny would likely enjoy a canine companion in his forever home. More info to come as he continues to settle in!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

His adoption fee is $380. Please fill out an application if you are interested in meeting him.\n\nPlease do not send inquiries asking if animals are still available, if you see it online, that means it is.  We only post available animals.  In order to adopt one of our puppies or dogs, an application must be filled out prior to Being invited to meet the dog.\n\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.

He is crate trained and working in learning to tell you when he needs to go out. He is 6 years old and because he was a matted mess we were forced to give him a new haircut. Frank is neutered and up to date on vaccines. He deserves his forever home. Is that you? His foster mom says his personality comes out more and more everyday... \nhis adoption fee is $600.

I had a family but they unfortunately passed away but thankfully, this nice rescue took me in! They say I\u2019m a shih tzu mix. I look the part but am a little bigger than the average shih tzu so maybe I have something else fun mixed in! I\u2019ve been in my foster home about a month and have finally started coming out of my shell. I\u2019m an old man so I like my sleep, but I still get small, short bursts of energy, which my foster parents really love to watch! I\u2019m fine with other dogs as long as they\u2019re not set on playing with me and could be fine as an only dog as well. I\u2019m a little different because I am deaf but I\u2019m such a good boy! My ideal home would be one with no other dogs or ones that don\u2019t pay me much attention. I\u2019d love to just have a super cozy bed to rest in and be able to come out to explore when I want. As far as potty training goes, I\u2019m really good at giving signals to let you know I need to go. I wear a belly band now just in case and am happy to do so. Mom and Dad don\u2019t crate me now but they think I\u2019d be fine in one although I don\u2019t have a destructive bone in my body. As far as health goes, I am deaf and will need eye drops for the rest of my life, but other than that I feel and have been doing great!! If you\u2019d like to meet me, please message the rescue page! Otherwise, these foster parents of mine may just try to keep me!\n\nIf you would like to meet Jiggs send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back to you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

Her ideal person would be someone that is just as active as she is, maybe a home with a big yard to run around and play. Dora adores women and has done will with older kids. She does need a little bit of time to warm up to unfamiliar males faces but she she knows they are her friend Dora's sweet personality will shine. Dora is a very smart girl as she is already is potty trained and knows; sot, stay, down, come, spin and jump. Dora is still working on her leash training but does enjoy going for long walks or runs. Dora has lived with dogs in the past and would do well with another dog who appreciates her energy level and playing style. She does like to chase after cats and ideally a cat free home would be best for Dora. When Dora isn't out exploring you can find her happily chewing on deer antlers or bones and playing with her favorite squeaky toys. There is so much to love about Dora, send in your adoption application today: https://www.underhoundrailroad.org/adoption\n\nDora is currently being fostered in Maine. 2/2/21 1:04 PM",

He is a friendly, affectionate, loving little cuddly bear who is still growing into his head & his feet and can be a little bit clumsy with both!  He is a playful, social, medium energy boy who has good leash manners, knows basic commands, and likes other dogs, cats, & kids (age 10+ recommended).  He is a curious, submissive, people pleaser looking for an an active family with a fenced yard and lots of playtime. He loves to be outside so a person/family that likes to hike or camp and will continue to socialize him around people & other animals would be ideal!  Woody is crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated, microchipped and is currently being housebroken in his foster home (about 90% complete with just a puppy accident here & there).\n\nFor more information about Woody, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

Molly is three years old, dog friendly but way too interested in kitties to safely live with them.  She would likely be fine with kids but because of her large size we do not feel comfortable placing her with little ones.\n\nIf you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application on our website:                          https://.barkdogfarm.rescuegroups.org/forms/ \n\nBefore applying be sure you have thoroughly researched the breed and will it be compatible with your lifestyle.  \nPlease be sure all family members are in agreement to adopting and your family is ready to bring dog home now. \nApplicants must be at least 21 years old. \nA volunteer will be in touch to discuss your application and the dog to determine if it is a good match. Your vet and two references will be called.  A virtual home visit done. Once approved a meet and greet at the farm will take place.  If all are in agreement and the animal has received its NH health certificate an adoption contract will be signed and adoption fee paid.  \nAdoption fees for dogs are $450. for adults over 12 months, $500 for puppies 12 months and younger.  Fees for seniors, special needs or harder to place dogs will be determined by our Board of Directors.\n All dogs will be altered when adoption is finalized, up to date on age appropriate core vaccines, negative for parasites, heart worm and lyme tested if 6 months or older, microchipped and have a current health certificate.  \nProof of a basic obedience course completed is part of our adoption contract within six months. \nOur descriptions are based on shelter evaluations, input from foster homes and interactions with our volunteers therefore are in no way a guarantee of temperment. \n\n! Please know we practice Covid-19 guidelines for mask wearing and social distancing.  Only approved applicants are allowed to meet our dogs outdoors at this time.

Our veterinary partner estimates that River is 8 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. River is good with people and other dogs. This adorable guy found himself homeless in a kill shelter, and when we heard about River, we immediately broke him out of there and now he's a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup! River is super laid back and has terrific manners for such a young man. River is a smart boy and he absolutely LOVES his doggy friends.

He is not your typical hound with his nose to the ground following whatever scent he caught a whiff of. No, this hound prefers cuddles and smooches. He can be a bit shy when you first meet, but he warms up quickly and is super friendly. He becomes your best friend fast and wants to be by your side all of the time. He loves that all encompassing type of hug that a person gives to a loved one who they haven't seen in ages. When he gets the zoomies it's as if his hind legs have a mind of their own and it's funny to witness his Gumby-like zoomies when they happen. \n\nHe isn't a vocal dog, which is also uncharacteristic for a hound, except for when it's time to eat. When it's time for his breakfast and dinner, he will call out to you continuously until you feed him. This boy loves mealtime! Otherwise, you don't hear a peep from him.\n\nIs Omelet the one you've been hoping for?",

With my husband staying home with the girls and my working, with his fear of doorways and men he would sit outside all day until I got home and we decided that he needs to go somewhere where he's more comfortable and not too scared to come inside when it's so cold. And somewhere without goats because he is not a fan. When he got inside and relaxed, he was fine with my husband, let the girls play with him, and snuggled us including the kid, other dog and cat. We just couldn't figure out how to get him inside when I'm at work and don't want him to freeze.!\nIf you would like to meet me, please visit our website and complete the pre-adoption application. Once it has been processed then we can make a date to get together!\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm tested (if over 2 years old), vaccinated, dewormed, flea and tick treated, microchipped and more before adoption. Our adoption policies include: Application, Vet Reference, Landlord approval & Criminal Background Check. We do not do same day adoptions. We request that you call for an appointment after your application has been approved to come and visit the dog of your choice. If you have a dog currently, you should bring him/her along to meet the new dog so we can see how everyone interacts. Our regular shelter hours are Tuesday through Friday noon to 5pm and Saturday 11am to 3pm. The online application can be found at :https://hsburnettcty.org/adoption-guidelines/ 2/2/21 10:01 AM",

She takes a little while to warm up to her surroundings but once she is comfortable, all she wants to do is lay on the couch and have her belly rubbed!  She is great with other dogs and so gentle. She is super smart and has already learned to use the doggy door to potty outside and to walk on a leash.  She is so grateful to have a safe place to be and a human to cuddle up with.\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nMeister is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February.\n\nMeister, 2 years old, male, pitbull, 43 lbs. This adorable dog was brought to our attention when he was placed on the euthanasia list in San Antonio, TX. We were able to spring him from the shelter life and are hoping to find his forever home in the PNW. \n\nMeister has been friendly with every dog he has met. He has been in a foster home with both male and female dogs. If the dog does not want to play with him, he leaves them alone. When Meister saw the dog in his foster home his face lit up and his body didn't stop wiggling. We think he would love a four legged friend to have as a companion. He does not seem overly playful and isn't needing an active playmate. \n\nHe is friendly to both females and males and we've seen no aggression, fear or anxiety. We have no history with kids so we recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nMeister is housebroken, but has had some accidents when first in a home. He has done some marking as well, but we know he is a smart boy & will easily catch on once he's taught! He walks great on a leash. \n\nMeister loves to snuggle, give kisses and lounge around the house. He appears to have low/moderate energy and is not super active. \n\nMeister would make an amazing emotional support animal as he just loves being with his people! Meister does have separation anxiety and has managed to escape from several crates.  In doing so he has several cuts on his face as we believe we squeezed through  or pushed through the door. He has scratched up a door to get out of the room he was in to find his person. He will need someone who is home more than they are away. He will also need a secure crate/area where he can't get out or destroy anything in trying to get out. \nWe would be willing to pay for one training session to help with this behavior with an agreed upon trainer in your area. \n\nWe have no history with cats. \n\nMeister is an incredibly sweet dog who wants to be loved. We are hopeful someone will be willing to help ease his separation anxiety and will be able to see what an amazing dog he is.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

She is a special girl and needs soft food due to having only 2 remaining teeth. She has had bloodwork done by our vet - all results have come back okay so far but we are awaiting the results of some of the tests. If this doll could be the perfect companion for you, please fill out an application today.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

If you take me home with you, I'll let you read Shakespeare to me while I lay by the fire on a wintry night where the snow-covered hills lighten up the night sky. Doesn't that sound nice? I'm a pretty relaxed dog. I'd love it if you read me stories and cozied up next to me. I ask that my family have no cats, but if a cat exists in a storybook that's being read to me, that's okay. \n\nWe are located at 8172 Washington Church Road, Washington Township, Ohio 45458 and are open Monday-Saturday, noon-7pm and Sunday, noon-6pm.

When I\u2019m really excited, I jump up on all 4 legs. I get so excited to see my foster family when they come home. I\u2019m always full of energy, but also love to snuggle. My favorite blankets are quilts; I like to curl up and take naps in them. My foster family says I am so much fun and I can\u2019t wait to find my furever home with my new family. \nAll of our animals are fixed, microchipped, started on age appropriate vaccines, dewormed, and on a flea/tick and heart worm preventative prior to adoption. Please note that all of our animals are in foster homes, and you must have an approved application to meet any of them unless at a scheduled meet and greet event.

She also likes slower movements when handling her. She came to us with a hernia and a mammary mass. Her surgery will be on the books soon. If this cutie could be for you,  please fill out an application today!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

He loves to give hugs and walks well on a leash. He can be timid about new thing so will need a home with patience. Odie is heartworm positive, but do not worry.... we will pay for his treatment and make him brand new again! Who is ready for kisses and hugs??\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Tonka has had a bit of rough go of it. She was adopted as a puppy from a shelter in Ohio and living the good life until her human adopted another puppy and because they didn't get along, Tonka was dropped at another shelter. She was adopted again and she and her human moved to Texas where he fell on hard times and had to give her up to another shelter. She sat for 6 weeks unloved and waiting. Tonka lost weight, her tail became bloody from constantly wagging it against the kennel walls in hopes that someone would pet her. Her spirit darkened and she became depressed. That's when DAWG stepped in and got her on the road to health and then sent her to us .\nTonka would really love a forever home that won't leave her again-where she can feel loved, needed and safe. Could that be you?\nWe do recommend no cats and is iffy about other dogs.\n\nIf you would like to meet me, please visit our website and complete the pre-adoption application. Once it has been processed then we can make a date to get together!\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm tested (if over 2 years old), vaccinated, dewormed, flea and tick treated, microchipped and more before adoption. Our adoption policies include: Application, Vet Reference, Landlord approval & Criminal Background Check. We do not do same day adoptions. We request that you call for an appointment after your application has been approved to come and visit the dog of your choice. If you have a dog currently, you should bring him/her along to meet the new dog so we can see how everyone interacts. Please visit our website for additional information. The online application can be found at :https://hsburnettcty.org/adoption-guidelines/",

For animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to lindsay.homewardtrails@gmail.com\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nMeet Todd and Diana! This sweet bonded pair comes to Homeward Trails from Fayette County, WV. Unfortunately, they were surrendered to the shelter (through no fault of their own!) after some hardships with their first family. Their story is sad, but they are clearly a fun and health duo, used to playtime and very sweet with new people. \n\nTodd is about 5 years old, 60 lbs and a neutered male, while Diana is 2 years old, 80 lbs and a spayed female. Check out this cute video of them as well. Their foster says they have settled in well, they love to play outside, go running, explore the backyard and snuggle up indoors. They seem sweet and resilient, with some minor signs of previous trauma, but very adaptable and happy dogs!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Lindsay\nLocation: Foster Home in DC\n\nThe adoption fee for Todd and Diana is $815. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip for both dogs.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",
