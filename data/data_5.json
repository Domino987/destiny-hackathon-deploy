It is our hope that we can find a happy, loving home for her.\n\nMiss Lady knows lots of tricks like sit, down, paw, high-five, come and stay. She gives soft, gentle kisses and always has a big smile on her face. She is eager to please, and loves to go for runs!

I know tricks such as sit, shake, down, speak, and roll over! I'm pretty treat motivated and always willing to learn. I came into the shelter because I got lost, but then I was surrendered anyways. I used to live in Stockton, but Chico is much nicer! I love all the space and open area around here! I'd prefer a home with a yard, but it's not a must have. All I need is someone to love and who will take good care of me for the rest of my life. I have lived with other dogs before but prefer to be the only dog in the home. I'd also prefer to go to a home with children over the age of 14 years old. If you are looking for an affectionate new family member ask staff about me today!",

            "description": "Sunshine is a 29 pound, 3 year old beagle that was surrendered with her sister Susie when they both flunked out of rabbit hunting school. While she is not going to give Elmer Fudd a run for his money, she most certainly could find a chicken nugget hidden in the house in 15 seconds flat! Sunshine walks nicely on the leash, and she is working on her potty training. She doesn\u2019t mind being crated and she is SUPER food motivated but doesn\u2019t have any food guarding issues. She will need regular exercise and to have her food intake carefully monitored because she would gladly eat her weight in dog food three times over daily. She really enjoys the company of other playful dogs so she would be happiest in a home with another dog (or her sister Susie). As is typical for a beagle, she will also follow an interesting scent anywhere so she will need a fenced yard or to remain on leash to keep her from  following her little nose off into far away places.\n\nThis dog is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested negative for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $450 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.  This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05. \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \n\nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!  If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

We will not be taking specific reservations for the individual puppies but rather appointments to have you come in and pick from the litter, so please be open minded to any of the pups. We will go in order of who asks for an appointment to see them first, second, 3rd, etc. but you must be able to come at whatever time is allotted to you on Thursday. \n\nThe pup's mom is 60 pounds, these pups will be large!! We are guessing anatolian shepherd/mastiff mixes. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our application with their name on it. Please note we respond to applications very quickly and if you are interested & have questions, we recommend doing the application first! We have availability every day to meet our pups! https://www.bordertailsrescue.org/adoption-application-for-dogs\n",

            "description": "Relinquished by his owner, King is an exceptional dog, who was unfortunately not given the time and care that he needed. He spent the majority of his time in a kennel, which is not ideal considering he enjoys spending his time being active. Brought in by a woman who got King for her son but things did not go as planned and King was not receiving the attention he needed and deserved. Being so young, he is smart and very receptive to training which is fortunate for a family who is willing to give him the love and care needed. He loves to be the center of attention and is a huge fan of belly rubs and scratches. King has been neutered, vaccinated including Rabies, wormed, tested for heartworm, and Micro-chipped.\n\nNote:  To adopt, you must live within approximately 100 miles of one of our adoption sites (Benld, O'Fallon or Springfield IL), and be at least 18 years of age.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Maya! I was rescued by a shelter in Georgia before arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. I am a truly beautiful and sweet girl who just wants your love. I like to play with all other dogs, regardless of their size, and I think that I could make an excellent family pet for any family with children. I'd be a perfect pick for a first-time adopter who's just looking for a loveable, quiet, and clean girl to add to their family. I could be very happy residing in any type of home, whether it is in an apartment, a big house with a yard, or a farm. Either a busy or quiet lifestyle would be just fine by me, as long as we can have plenty of snuggle time! I may be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you in public, if you wanted to. I appear to be mostly potty-trained and I love to go for long leashed walks around the ranch.",

Yes, they also rescue HORSES!~!!!\n\nHe would be a great addition to a home that wants a love muffin snuggler lap dog ! NO young /small children that scares most small dogs., See his very detailed description below!\n\nThank you for wanting to adopt! Our application can be found at haydudeequine.org\n\nIf you have any problems with the application link please email jminarcin@hartjobs.com\n\nAdoption fee $525 includes her transport, health certificate and ALL his medical, neuter, shots, chipping etc. done by Hey Dude Equine Rescue.\n\n  If you have issues with the application please email the rescue at the above email. . We MUST have an application first thank you. We have a very detailed description.\n\nHi! My name is Benny! I am a super sweet boy, and love pretty much everyone I meet, I just take a little time to warm up. I show no aggression towards anything or anyone ever . I weigh approx. 10 or 11 pounds.  I am at the very most 4 years old (what the vets who examined me have said). Maybe I\u2019m younger? They do not know. I am a total lap dog. I love being on your lap and I will be very quiet and easy and just sleep there w/o disturbing you. My foster home says I am so wonderful I have not pottied at all in the house!\n\nI can be a little shy with new people, but will be their best friend soon! I was saved by my rescue from a hoarding case in south Texas. There were over 70 of us dogs in a little house with 2 humans. When foster mom got me, I had never even seen grass before! Even though I was not exposed to much in my early days, I am very human centric.  I am great with puppies and other small dogs, I haven\u2019t met BIG dogs! I love love my humans and graze when I\u2019m hungry. Im not a big eater and just love hanging out with my humans and will sleep on your lap if you let me. \nPlease a winter coat and rain coat would be great for me in the PNW.\n\nI am a pretty white and brown likely chihuahua terrier mix. . I sleep in a crate unless you allow me on your bed/furniture!!!  and get on and off the furniture. Please make sure the furniture is not too high so when i jump down I don't get injured. Even though everything is so new, I get along  great with all I have met. I do understand no , so if you don\u2019t allow your dog on the furniture just tell me no. If you don\u2019t want a dog on your lap then I\u2019m not the right dog because I do love human laps! \n\nI am a professional snuggler. I love other dogs, and do ok with kids as long as they are older kids, dog savvy and gentle with me. NO little kids they are too enthusiastic sometimes in their snuggle efforts, so I would do best in a home with kids over the age of approximately 8 or 10. Depends on the children. However a quieter home is likely best for me.\n\n I am so deserving of a forever after. Please apply to adopt me",

But it's no big deal because I'll stay close to you and watch you carefully. You can 'talk' to me with hand signals. My foster mom says I'm the sweetest, calmest Rat Terrier around. (Since I'm around 7 years old, the indiscretions and misbehaviors of youth are a thing of the past.) I'm a good girl, who knows how to sit for treats and who walks like a dream on leash. I'm also house-trained and crate trained. I get along fabulously with all the inhabitants of my foster home, including the other Rattie, the big dog, the cat, the guinea pig, and the young human. In fact, I like just about everyone I meet. And best of all, at 18 lbs., I excel at being a lap dog. Do you have a lap for me? You can find more photos of me at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/gracenc .\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

He is a bit on the shy side when first meeting people, but warms up quickly and enjoys being pet. He'll nudge and ask for more petting if you stop. \n\nMax won't require a lot in the way of exercise; shorter walks to explore and sniff will suffice. He would definitely love a soft bed and blankets to snuggle into while hanging out with his people. He's been neutral about seeing other dogs, and would probably do best in a home with other mellow dogs or by himself. \n\nMax is a medium to large sized mixed breed, approximately 7 years young, and is full grown at 44 pounds. \n\nPlease email: adopt@gigis.org to inquire or apply to adopt this special, handsome guy!",

            "description": "Meet Cherry (aka Lilly), a sweet, beautiful girl looking for her furever home!  \n\nLilly is getting along well with her foster's resident dog.  She plays well with the neighborhood children ages 5 and up, walks well on leash and is house-trained!  She loves car rides and just hanging our with her humans!  She isn't a fan of her crate, but has proven to not be destructive when left alone.  And...she talks back to you! I included a video of her \"talking\" to her foster mom, it is VERY cute!  \n\nLilly came to us very underweight and emaciated.  With some TLC she has gained some weight and is doing very well.  For the time being, she should be fed small amounts of food and water throughout the day.  Since she was not fed much in her previous home, she will eat too fast and cause her stomach to become upset.  She needs to slowly get her tummy used to eating on a regular basis.\n\nThis poor girl has obviously had a rough few years behind her, but she is still a sweetheart in spite of it.  She will make a wonderful addition to your family! \n\n\nApply at: http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/\n\n\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nShe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\nApplications are required before meeting a dog. To fill out an application go to\n http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org\n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

To begin the process please fill out an application here:  http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\nThis is my foster dog...if you or anyone you know is interested in adopting this dog please contact: www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nName: \t\tSaint \nGender: \tMale \nColor:\t\tRed Sable\nDOB:\t\t01/28/2015\nBreed:\t\tPomeranian  \nWeight:\t12 lbs\n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog's age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon't forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com/DogGoneInn",

I had them in the side of a building at a farm that I wandered in to, I am a very happy girl and I just want to be where you are! I love to have toys around to play with so I don't get bored, they have to be durable toys though or I will tear them up! I am not a fan of other dogs at first, and if there are any in my new home I will have to meet them at the shelter first to make sure that I like them. I would get along with children but I will need to be trained not to jump up on them. I have seen cats here at the shelter but I would need supervision around them at first to make sure we would get along. My puppies have all moved on to their furrever homes and I can't wait to find a family to call my own!",

            "description": "TO CONTACT THE FOSTER HOME, email applications@acdra.org. DO NOT use the Petfinder form. Inquiries don't reach us.\n\nMeet Summit! A 5 month old male Red Heeler!  Summit is 35lbs & still growing! His name is a great indicator of one of his favorite activities, hiking. Summit also enjoys lounging & quiet time, structured leash walks, training/learning new commands, playing with a softy, fetch, belly rubs, & getting kibble out of his kong.  Although Summit enjoys and is fast friends with humans & dogs alike, he\u2019d be best as the only dog in the household. Once Summit has bonded with his adopter and established a solid recall, he might enjoy off leash walks and play with other dogs.\n\nSummit has a great temperament, lots of energy, is curious about the world, & is very smart. He is crate trained, housebroken & knows basic commands.  Sit, lay, drop, leave it, are ones he has down pretty well. We have Summit sit before he eats his meals & he waits until he is told to \"get it\". He is working on stay & his recall is great! Summit\u2019s manners will need continued work, as with any heeler puppy.  He practices sitting before exiting doors, eyes, & responds well to his name on walks. We are working on his leash pulling & so far he is doing incredible in public places. He is able to pass people no problem. Summit will need help with his leash reactivity on walks when he sees other dogs and when in the car. Positive reinforcement & redirection seem to be key.  He\u2019s a quick learner & I am sure with time he will be a great companion to jog or run with. He has not been socialized with cats or small children.\n\nSummit is a really incredible dog! He needs human companions who will exercise him & train him regularly. If exposed to new experience in an intentional & timely way, I am sure he will be able to go anywhere & be comfortable in many situations standing proudly by your side. \n\nSummit will be adopted on a neuter contract.  He also is microchipped and up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. Summit is being fostered in Cambridge, NY. Please email applications@acdra.org with any questions.\n\nCOMPLETE AN APPLICATION\nhttp://www.acdra.org/adoption-application\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "All interested people should submit an adoption application as their first step.\n\nMarnie is a very sweet but very shy 5 yr old beagle. She was found in the south with 7 newborn puppies, whom whe was an excellent mother to. All of the puppies got adopted, and Marnie stayed to be surrogate mother to additional litters with no mother. She is quiet, and she love love loves to shred her stuffed animal toys but doesn't mess with anything in the house that isn't hers. Marnie is housebroken and loves to be outside (when it's not snowing)! She pulls very hard on leash, and we don't think she had much experience with being leash walked in her life. A fenced-in yard is a must for her. She warms up to women most easily but is suspicious of men. We feel she may have had some trauma at the hands of a man at some point in her life, so a female home is ideal for her. However, she currently has a foster dad who she is fond of but also weary of him at times. She has never growled, or even raised a lip at a human though. When she encounters someone she is shy around, she finds her bed and lays down preferring to be left alone. Fireworks and loud noises also send her cowering, but if you are willing to give her some time, she returns your patience with lots of love! Her favorite thing is following her foster mom around and hanging out next to her desk when she works. She is great with all dogs (very submissive) and is currently living with 4 of them. We feel living with other dogs is beneficial to Marnie so she can gain confidence. If you are looking for a sweet, easy dog who just needs some time, please check out Marnie!\n\nAll pets adopted from GDHS are spayed or neutered, have vaccinations brought up to date, are on heartworm preventative (dogs), FIV/FELV tested (cats) and microchipped.\nThe Greater Derry Humane Society does not have a physical shelter, and all visits are by appointment only.\n\n2/2/21 10:31 AM",

He is 1 of 7 siblings surrendered to the shelter, so they all came to Illinois to find a forever home. Though from Arkansas he loves the snow and his toys. He is an energetic puppy who adores attention and a lot of love to give. He does great with everyone, kids and other dogs. He is learning basic puppy manners, crate training and potty training all of which are going well. He will need someone home (not left alone more then a few hours) to continue with these basics and socialization skills. With love and patience he will make a wonderful addition to any home.\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8. WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS \n \nMedical included is as follows:\nSpay/Neuter (age appropriate) *Forever Home uses Fox Valley Animal Welfare League in Aurora, IL\nAge appropriate core vaccines\nFecal testing and deworming\nFlea and tick preventative\nFree 1st Vet visit at one of our participating vets\nMicrochipping\n \nForever Home Dog Rescue reserves the right to deny any applicant.\n\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

We rescued her from a shelter and was told she was good with dogs, cats, and children but found out very quickly she is not okay with being friends with a cat. I have a feeling she may have been a coon dog at one point in her life and I think cats symbolize a small prey animal too much for her to ever reconsider being friends with one. She has however been magnificent with both of my young children and my older large breed dog. She has quickly become quite the bed bug and lazy girl. She is amazing in the crate and doesn't make a peep. Potty training would be the only challenge for this sweet girl. I don't think she's ever lived inside but is very smart and I'm sure will pick it up rather quickly. If your looking for a low energy couch potato, she is your kinda gal! (NO CATS)",

I love to follow my foster mom around the house and I do well with her dogs and cats. I am not the type of dog who would be a playmate to other dogs - I prefer CALM dogs. Hyper, rambunctious dogs make me nervous.\nI have been potty trained in my foster home, which is great, but please note that it is normal to have accidents in a new environment.\n\nNo apartment/condo\nFenced in yard required\nNo children under 16 (now and in the future)\nI require a home with a calm dog or cat\n\nMy adoption fee is $350, which includes my neuter, shots, heartworm testing, and microchipping. You can find the adoption application and process on our website www.orphanannierescue.org. \n\nYou must live in metro Atlanta to adopt me.",

We could see what a sweet gentle soul he is (Tigger calmly greeted the dog we were saving with soft body language and accepted petting happily) that we came back the very next day and got him. And boy are we glad we did. He is THE perfect dog - the total package. He's great with people, dogs and kids. He absolutely loves to snuggle with you anywhere, anytime and enjoys the company of of all pups big and small (he's fostered with two resident dogs and they get along great -- even the shy one).\n\nTigger also enjoys a good frolic in the park and long walks he's great for the outdoorsy/active types. But, he's super calm while at home. Despite being neglected in his previous home -- he sustained an eye injury that went untreated and he now has limited vision in that eye -- he is the happiest, most open hearted dog you could meet. We will make the perfect family pet. Inquire about Tigger today!",

Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nPuppies - We do not adopt puppies under 16 weeks to out of state adopters.  This is due to our spay/neuter policies, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered before leaving Georgia state lines.  We do not adopt siblings to the same household.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with the next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nLeo is a sweet boy from a rural shelter in VA. Leo can be shy with meeting new people but once he warms up to you he is your best friend! Due to Leo's shy behavior he would prefer a home with no kids under the age of 15 years old! Leo loves other dogs and loves to play! Leo has shown some signs of separation anxiety so he will need a home that is willing and able to work on it with him so he feels more comfortable being alone! \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Katie R\nLocation: Foster Home\n\nIncludes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital, and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.",

Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nPuppies - We do not adopt puppies under 16 weeks to out of state adopters.  This is due to our spay/neuter policies, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered before leaving Georgia state lines.  We do not adopt siblings to the same household.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

I am doing well on housebreaking and house rules.  I have learned to go outside when a bell is rung and come in to a whistle where I sit right inside the door \u2013 and get a treat. \nI love to play with any toy around and I don\u2019t mind the cold and snow at all.  \nThe resident cat looks really interesting and I wish he would play with me but I can be distracted. \n\nWill you be the family to love me and teach me everything I need to learn ?  \n\nGo to Spotslaststop.org  to fill out an application if you would like to meet me.\nNote: We consider potential adopters only after an application has been submitted.  A PetFinder inquiry could slow that process down.  A dog will be set to Adoption Pending once we have at least 3 valid applications.\n\nNote:  Puppies this young will not be adopted outside of Minnesota.\n\n",

He is 1 of 7 siblings surrendered to the shelter, so they all came to Illinois to find a forever home. Though from Arkansas he loves the snow and his toys. He is an energetic puppy who adores attention and a lot of love to give. He does great with everyone, kids and other dogs. He is learning basic puppy manners, crate training and potty training all of which are going well. He will need someone home (not left alone more then a few hours) to continue with these basics and socialization skills. With love and patience he will make a wonderful addition to any home.\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8. WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS \n \nMedical included is as follows:\nSpay/Neuter (age appropriate) *Forever Home uses Fox Valley Animal Welfare League in Aurora, IL\nAge appropriate core vaccines\nFecal testing and deworming\nFlea and tick preventative\nFree 1st Vet visit at one of our participating vets\nMicrochipping\n \nForever Home Dog Rescue reserves the right to deny any applicant.",

Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nPuppies - We do not adopt puppies under 16 weeks to out of state adopters.  This is due to our spay/neuter policies, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered before leaving Georgia state lines.  We do not adopt siblings to the same household.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

No apartments!\nFence Requirements: Preferred\nSpecial Info: Nala is well behaved, already housebroken, and has been well cared for since birth!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nPuppies - We do not adopt puppies under 16 weeks to out of state adopters.  This is due to our spay/neuter policies, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered before leaving Georgia state lines.  We do not adopt siblings to the same household.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Eloise is a little sweetie pie who came to us from our friends at the Rescue Network after she was rescued from a reservation in South Dakota. She is approximately 6-7 months old and currently weighs 26 pounds. She does have some growing left to do. She will need to be vet checked and spayed and her fee is $125.\n\nEloise is friendly and affectionate. She does need some basic obedience training but is smart and eager to please. We do think she would be okay with other dogs but have no way of knowing about cats. She should be fine with kids.\n\nNOTE: We are doing adoptions via private appointment only, once an application has been completed and approved. Applications can be submitted at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

This sweet girl was picked up as a local stray and sat waiting in the shelter for someone to claim her to no avail.\n\nIn her foster home she is working on her basic manners and social skills. She loves to play ball and can keep herself occupied while chewing on a bone. Being full of personality, Cassie does have a few bad habits, but she is working on getting better every day!\n\nCassie is crate trained, but is still working on her potty training when she is loose in the house. She LOVES everyone she meets, but can be a bit nervous in unfamiliar environments. Cassie does best with dogs her size or larger. She has met a few cats and is curious, but does not fixate on them. Cassie's perfect home would have kids over the age of 12 or an active family who wants a dog that can keep up with them during the day, but snuggle up on the couch at night.\n\nPlease fill out an application if you would like to add this perfect girl to your family!

The poor dog came in with a severe ear infection in both ears and could not walk three steps without shaking her head.  Thankfully a vet visit solved that problem and some food should solve her other problem of being thin!  She currently weighs 52 lbs. and we would like to see another 10 lbs. on her.  She has a strong and smart personality and learns new tricks quickly.  She knows sit, down, and come and is treat driven.  Bella will make a wonderful new family member.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nPuppies - We do not adopt puppies under 16 weeks to out of state adopters.  This is due to our spay/neuter policies, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered before leaving Georgia state lines.  We do not adopt siblings to the same household.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in one of our Hero Babies!  Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  \n\nPuppies - We do not adopt puppies under 16 weeks to out of state adopters.  This is due to our spay/neuter policies, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered before leaving Georgia state lines.  We do not adopt siblings to the same household.  \n\nYour Current Pets - We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  \n\nAdoptions - We do not have a shelter and are a foster-home based organization. We do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet. You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt. Once your application is approved it will be sent to the foster family that is currently caring for the dog. They will be able to provide information on likes, dislikes, personality, etc. They will also schedule a time for you to meet the dog. We do require a homecheck prior to adoption.\n\nInquiries - If you would like more information on any dogs in the rescue, please email us at info@herorescue.org.",

            "description": "Courage is a 1 1/2 year old male Chesapeake Bay Retriever mix that came to us as a stray.  There had been multiple sightings of him as he roamed the countryside on his own where he learned to defend himself from other dogs and other unknown predators.  He was not as easy catch as life on his own had taught him to run away first and ask questions later!  Now that he is safe, he is very glad for human attention, but other dogs make him nervous and we think he would be happiest as the only dog in the family.  He will need time and patience and we recommend no children under the age of 10.  Courage weighs 70 lbs. and will need a fenced yard so he knows his roaming days are over.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations. \n",

Some leash and basic command training would be very helpful! There is some mild cage aggression, but he is fine once he is out of the kennel. He did fine with our shelter cat. Because of his energy level and jumping, he would do best in home with older children.",

Since he has been in our care he has quickly become a staff favorite. He is attention demanding, very curious, and overall just a huge goof ball! We don't know much about his past... We are requiring all humans to be over the age of 6 since Dallas' past is such a mystery. He will need an active family that will be able to provide him the physical and mental stimulation he needs. This big boy will keep you on your toes and will shower you with kisses. If would like to meet this chocolate chunk ask a kennel staff member to meet him!!",

I love to cuddle and get belly rubs and will paw at the door to let you know I need to go out to potty! My huge smile lets you know I am a happy dog. I hope you will let me put my smile on your face, too. I do best as only pet or with dog similar size as me. No cats or small dogs. Love, Rocky.\n\n\n\nI qualify for Foster First, which means you can foster me for 14 days prior to adoption to ensure I'm the perfect fit for your family!",

Cooper is a big ole teddy bear who will crawl right up onto your lap if you let him. He LOVES being outside and going for walks and does really well on a leash. He would do great with an active family and one with a canine brother or sister to play with would be even better! Because he forgets his size sometimes, a family with older children would be best for him but he is overall very gentle and sweet. \n\nCooper has had hardly any accidents in his foster home and has been doing great learning some basic commands. Hes a silly boy and might try to steal a slipper or two when youre not looking, but overall seems to understand and respond well to no. He loves his toys, napping next to his foster mom while she works and watching out the window throughout the day. He is crate trained and neutered. \n\nHis foster moms favorite thing about him is how he thinks hes a lap dog and will scoot up right next to you or on you when hes got the chance! \n\nIf you are interested in Cooper please apply at https://www.nickelcitycaninerescue.org/adopt-a-dog or message the rescue if you are already pre-approved.",

            "description": "Penelope is a chi mix who is about a year old and 11 pounds. She may have applications in progress but is currently available. Penelope is a shy girl, but just bursting with love when she warms up. If you're looking for a sweetheart of a lap dog, she's well worth the wait of letting her get to know you at her pace. She is blossoming in her foster home, and coming out of her shell more each day. \n\nAfter some slow introductions with her foster fur siblings, Penelope is now happy to play and enjoys it. She is equally happy to snuggle in your lap all day though. This pretty girl is potty trained and would do best with a secure fenced in yard to help her comfort level and prevent her from escaping if she gets spooked. She also needs a home without small children as their unpredictable nature can scare her. And while she's a worthy and happy playmate for other dogs when properly introduced, she can be too rough with kitties, so should have only canine fur siblings. \n\nBecause of her lack of confidence and fearful nature, she will need a fur friend. She takes their cues and really needs one to learn that the world isn't so scary . With that said, she will need decompression for a day or two, with a new friend, and slow intros. Because even new friends are scary at first. Once shes settled in, she's great and will follow their lead! \n\nAdoption fee is $300 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.\n\nSTS is a foster-based and volunteer-run rescue. We do not have a physical location or set hours for you to meet dogs, and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in foster homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is completed you will be able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs. We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A Petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application.

Matilde is STILL AVAILABLE for adoption if you see her posting. We \n     promptly update when our pups are adopted. No need to email asking.\n\n     As we are an all volunteer rescue operating with a shortfall of volunteers, we \n    may NOT BE ABLE TO REPLY TO INDIVIDUAL INQUIRIES in a timely manner, \n    HOWEVER... please know that each and every APPLICATION SUBMITTED is \n    thoroughly looked at and considered.\n\n3. A fully fenced yard is necessary for adopting any of our precious rescue pups. \n    Homes with electric fences will not be considered for adoption.\n\n\nMeet little Matilde.... 6 week old Jack Russell Terrier and just the cutest little thing.\n\nMatilde will be arriving, with her brother Spud, at the end of the month. We hope to have the pups forever families waiting to welcome them home.\n\nIt is always appropriate to consider the needs of the pups breed that you will be welcoming to your family. Thank you. \n\nMatilda's adoption fee is $550, plus a $75 spay retainer which will be returned to you upon proof of spay.\n\n",

My name is China. I came from Texas originally.\n\nFrom Her Texas Foster:\n\nChina is very shy and afraid and will need time to warm up to her new family.\n\nShe is timid and shy and will need a patient family that will allow her to warm up and come out of her shell. She is afraid of being touched at first, but after a few weeks she is ok being held. She came with another dog and follows him for confidence, due to that she will require another confident dog in her forever home. The first week she did not want to eat, but eventually and with enough bribery she ate.\n\nShe will need a family that is willing to give her the time and patience to be the best version of herself. Due to her shyness a fenced in yard will also be required in order to keep her safe.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website,\n\nwww.ruffstartrescue.org\n\nfor more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota.

He is your typical Weimar, so he's looking for people who have experience with his breed so they know what they're getting in to and will love his quirks. Bert's favorite activity is fetch, and he gets a bit intense when playing. He would probably play fetch all day as long as someone is there to throw the ball! He's looking for an active home that can give him ALL the exercise and training. He will need some work on his basic manners, as well as self control and management for potential toy guarding. Bert wants to be with his people as much as possible due to his separation anxiety. Bert is picky with the dog friends he wants to make. He would enjoy having a smaller, relaxed, dog friend. Bert also wouldn't mind living with dog savvy kids aged 12+ or kitties. He is not appropriate for apartment living. \nHave an inquiry? Want to adopt?

            "description": "Hi there!  My name is Jasper and I\u2019m waiting and hoping for a forever home.  You see, one day I found myself wandering all alone.  I think my people went off and left me, but I don\u2019t know why because I do try my best to be a good boy.  Lucky for me, a kind person came along and brought me to this rescue and now I\u2019m safe in my nice foster home where I\u2019m getting lots of TLC till I find  a family that will never leave me on my own again.\n \nHere are some things I can tell you about me:  I\u2019m about 1 year old and weigh in at 55 pounds.  My breed is a best guess, but my foster mom says I am a hound mix.  She tells me whatever I am doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m a handsome, lovable boy.  That makes me happy.  I am house trained, crate trained and coming along nicely with my leash training.  I like to please my humans and I listen well.  I am not fostered with children, but I\u2019m an easy going boy with medium energy and I love all people so I think I\u2019d enjoy having kids in my family.  They should be over 5 because I\u2019m still young yet and wouldn\u2019t want to get too playful around little ones.  I also get along great with other dogs and behave well around cats.\n \nYou\u2019ll be glad to know that I am neutered and up to date on my vaccinations.  I\u2019m also micro-chipped and on monthly flea/tick and heart worm preventative.  My doggy bag is packed and I\u2019m so excited to get the word that my forever home has been found.  If you think I may be the boy for you, please email Laurie at lovelabs816@gmail.com for an application and she\u2019ll send one right out to you.  My adoption fee is $400.  Can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n \nLike us on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PawsClawsNewEngland\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne\n\nLaurie Terebesi\nAdoption Coordinator Northeast Region\nlovelabs816@gmail.com\n \n",

Ryder's owner had Covid and was unable to continue to care for him due to the Covid lingering effects.  When we were contacted Ryder had gone to stay with friends but they only allowed him to stay in the cold garage, which was not what Ryder's owner wanted for him.  Ryder's owner contacted us and asked if we would be able to take him and find him a new home so that he wasn't staying in a cold and lonely garage.  Ryder was thought to be a Lab/Rottie mix, but he is a very smaller sized lab.  Unfortunately, his tail was docked when he was young,  He is a very sweet boy who even smiles at you.  He needs a home with a loving family who will allow him to be part of the family.  No more being left outside where he will bark out of frustration from being lonely.  Ryder is active and in great physical shape.  If you are looking for a companion who is very loving, easygoing, enjoys walks, playing fetch, and cuddling on the couch, Ryder may be a great match for you.  If you are interested in meeting Ryder or learning more about him, please go to our website, goldenrescue.com.  Please read our adoption process and then complete the online application. https://www.goldenrescue.com/adoption-process/ Please note we DO NOT adopt outside the state of Colorado.",

Unfortunately they are moving to Florida and cannot take the boys with them. They have wonderful personalities! Very bonded. We would like them to go to a furever home together if possible. \n\nHe is 2 years old. His current weight is around 15 pounds. He is neutered. \n\nCharlie's adoption fee is $150.00. The adoption fee includes the initial vaccines, spay/neuter surgery, microchipping and a deworming. \n\nWe are currently only open by appointment. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our workers/volunteers that are there to take care of the animals. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nPlease visit our website to fill out an application so we can better assist you in your search for your next fur baby.  http://www.achs-pets.com/Application.html \n\nWe are a BEST MATCH facility. We try to match the pet\u2019s personality and needs with the family\u2019s needs and lifestyle to increase the likelihood of a lifetime happy relationship for the whole family. The online application we provide on our website, achs-pets.com, is a preliminary application. After you have completed the application, please give us 3 to 5 business days to process it. We check vaccine records for current & past pets as well as Landlord approval if you do not own your home. We hope you will understand our effort to provide our animals with the best new situation that is possible.",

Please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process at newhoperescue.org. \n\nThis dog is being fostered with New Hope Dog Rescue (Saskatoon).  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an Adoption Application. Meet and greets are by appointment only and done so after an adoption application has been submitted. A successful applications will be contacted by the foster home to discuss further. We are volunteer run so please be patient.\n\nHi my name is Julez. I am about 10 weeks young. I am a mixed breed and think i will be medium to a large dog.\n\nI can sit and lie down and \u201cgo kennel\u201d 85 Percent of the time. I am very food motivated and take my treats gently. Actually I love my treats!\n\nAt night i stay in my crate all night without any accidents or crying.\nDuring the day I stay in my crate for 2 hours sometime longer with no accidents. Then have a playtime outside, weather permitting. \n\nI am working hard at outside training but will need some additional, consistent guidance.\n\nI have no other animals or children to play with now but i think i would be more than happy to be with a larger family. \n \nI love to meet and greet new people at my fosters clinic. They say I am very smart and after a few minutes, I am very caIm. However, when i am excited I tend to nibble and chew on my fosters hands but i am easily redirected with toys or reassurance if i stop.\n    \nI do have lots of energy but i am a puppy, once I play and do some training I am completely happy to lie on my mat and chew on a toy while I hang out with my fosters. I am very calm and love to snuggle close to my foster people. \n\nJulez has been microchipped, dewormed, current on age appropriate vaccines and has received a health check from a vet. adoption fee is $495 (200 is refunded upon proof of spay).\n\nTo view more dogs go to http://www.newhoperescue.org/adopt/available-dogs/\n\nDisclaimer: in most cases we are guessing the breed mix. These are best guesses on our part. For puppies it can be extremely difficult and we are also guessing on what size they will be. \n\nNEW HOPE DOG RESCUE is not a shelter. Our dogs are placed in loving foster homes. WE NEED FOSTER HOMES TO HELP MORE DOGS - CONTACT US TODAY!!!\nDefinitions:\nPending - means that we are working through the adoption process with the 1st applicant. We usually don't add the pending until we are pretty sure the adoption will go through (like at the home visit stage)\nAdopted - you know!! A happy ending for a homeless dog.",

            "description": "Jack is a spunky brown and white Jack Russel & Chihuahua mix. He lived in a home with a wonderful family with his brother Charlie. Unfortunately they are moving to Florida and cannot take the boys with them. They have wonderful personalities! Very bonded. We like them to go to a furever home together if possible. \n\nHe is 2 years old. His current weight is around 15 pounds. He is neutered. \n\nJack's adoption fee is $150.00. The adoption fee includes the initial vaccines, spay/neuter surgery, microchipping and a deworming. \n\nWe are currently only open by appointment. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our workers/volunteers that are there to take care of the animals. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nPlease visit our website to fill out an application so we can better assist you in your search for your next fur baby.  http://www.achs-pets.com/Application.html \n\nWe are a BEST MATCH facility. We try to match the pet\u2019s personality and needs with the family\u2019s needs and lifestyle to increase the likelihood of a lifetime happy relationship for the whole family. The online application we provide on our website, achs-pets.com, is a preliminary application. After you have completed the application, please give us 3 to 5 business days to process it. We check vaccine records for current & past pets as well as Landlord approval if you do not own your home. We hope you will understand our effort to provide our animals with the best new situation that is possible.",

He is also neutered and microchipped. \n\nZeus has been raised with a littermate which has caused him to wander and not always return when called. Especially if he and his brother were loose together. \n\nOn leash, he is very well behaved and enjoys going on walks. He is an outdoor dog and has successfully been around goats, a calf, ducks, chickens, and cats. They do seem to successfully keep coyotes and other predators away from our property even though they are confined to a paddock or tethered run. \n\nZeus is also familiar with adults and kids. Does not exhibit any bad behaviors around humans. Has spent some daytime hours indoors, but has never spent the night in a house. \n\nZeus is still at an impressionable age of 3 and can be used as a working guardian dog or a family pet with additional obedience training.\n\n\n",

He is neutered and microchipped. \n\nApollo has been raised with a littermate which has caused him to wander and not always return when called. Especially if he and his brother were loose together. On leash, he is very well behaved and enjoys going on walks. He is an outdoor dog and has successfully been around goats, a calf, ducks, chickens, and cats. They do seem to successfully keep coyotes and other predators away from our property even though they are confined to a paddock or tethered run. \n\nApollo is also familiar with adults and kids. Does not exhibit any bad behaviors around humans. Has spent some daytime hours indoors, but has never spent the night in a house. Apollo is still at an impressionable age of 3 and can be used as a working guardian dog or a family pet with additional obedience training.\n\n",

She came to us from someone that was using her for breeding and were told that she was a beagle, but we think she looks more like a beagle basset. Pansy is the sweetest girl you could ever meet. She gets along well with everyone. We were told that she is about 7 years old, she was very overweight at 40 pounds when she arrived. Her foster mom has been working on getting her to slim down and she is starting to enjoy going for a walk. Pansy has now been spayed and she did have a hernia that they found when they spayed her. New Britain did reduce the hernia and they do believe that since she will no longer be able to have puppies that she should be just fine. If you are looking for a very sweet girl for your family, Pansy is it. She is now up to date with vaccines for, microchipped and tested negative for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $300.00. If you are interested in adopting Pansy, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

Winona was much more shy then her siblings and her foster has been working hard to get her used to being on a leash and meeting new people. Winona as a very sweet girl about 9-10 months old and 55 pounds. We were told that she is 3/4 Pyrenees and 1/4 Anatolian Shepherd. Winona is going to need a home with another dog friendly dog to help her transition and a fenced in yard. She will not make a good apartment or city dog. Experience with large guardian breed dogs is a plus. She will be very loyal and get attached to her family. Winona is now spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped and tested negative for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $450.00. If you are interested in adopting Winona, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

            "description": "This is Maxine, she is a 12 week old Pittie/lab x puppy, she weighs approximately 17 lbs.  Maxine came into rescue with her brother after being tossed in a field in AL. They were found by nice lady who brought the puppies into her home and drove them to TN.    Maxine is a very happy and snugly little girl.  Typical puppy, working on potty training and crate training.  Interested applicants should fill out an application!    \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

If you are looking to meet new friends, my ears will be a great conversation starter, or you can just admire them yourself.  I\u2019m a good boy. I have been in a loving foster home, but I would really like a forever family of my very own.  I\u2019m medium to large sized weighing about 65 pounds of unconditional love. \u2019m a friendly boy who loves all people.  Sometimes when I get excited I will jump, so I\u2019d probably be best with kids 9+ unless they are dog savvy.  I listen well though and when told no, I will stop.  I am food motivated, smart and eager to please so a little direction could remedy that.  Otherwise, I\u2019m a mellow energy boy who is cuddly and loves giving kisses.  I enjoy being up on the sofa or in bed snuggling.  I\u2019m goofy and playful and also love going on adventures with my person in the great outdoors, as you can see from my pictures.  I\u2019m crate trained, housetrained and I\u2019ve even been neutered, up to date on my shots, so I\u2019m ready to go.  I\u2019m just looking for a loving family of my very own who will play with me and love me as much as I will love them.  I\u2019ll give you the best kisses and cuddles you\u2019ve ever had.  Check out my pictures, I\u2019m adorable and again, those ears!  If you want to know more about me or meet me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at martinaanimalrescue@gamil.com.\nLove, Bubba",

He is a friendly 3 1/2 year old mixed breed dog. He is 60 lbs. Mark is a nice dog and he gets along with other dogs. He is not at all a fan of cats. \n\nMark is at Homeward Trails Adoption Center in Fairfax Station and is eager to meet you. \n\nMark was brought to a rural shelter as a stray before coming to Homeward Trails. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center \nLocation: Adoption Center\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program.",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nZEKE Is a happy, smiling Aussie mix dog. His age is listed as 1 to 2 years and he weighs 48 pounds. He is mostly a creamy white color with touches of tan and black markings. This is another dog that staff really likes. They think he is a doll! Unfortunately, he has not yet been neutered. So, please read the important information below. Then, call the shelter staff to schedule an adoption appointment if you would like to add this boy to your family.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you. \n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

            "description": "Sweet Ghost is a gorgeous 3 year old husky boy, who literally was saved the last minute from a highkill shelter. Ghost is very loving and super friendly, who is great with people and gets along with other dogs. He is friendly with young kids but can get anxious with sudden movement and being touched from the back, so preferably a family with older kids.  As a typical young husky, Ghost needs at least 1-2 hours of daily exercise to get his energy out, then he will be super calm, chill and mellow for the most part, His wonderful foster family recently potty trained him and taught him sit, but he definitely needs more training for other commands. Ghost is a quick learner, curious, and playful. A sweet home with other doggie friends for him to play with and a decent secure yard would be best for this energetic boy, \nGhost is neutered, microchipped and current on vaccines. Please email Alljoy4paws@yahoo.com to spoil this precious boy!",

            "description": "Pistachio is a beautiful female German Shepherd estimated around a year of age. Pistachio was a stray therefore we do not know her history or background.\n\nPistachio is a sweet girl with those she knows but is very timid and unsure of new people. She can be vocal and skittish initially when meeting especially in new places. Pistachio does well going through pet stores and parks but during focused meetings she does not handle the attention well. If she is ignored and allowed to check someone out from afar first she does better but if she is rushed or has all the attention on her Pistachio will bark and be defensive. Once Pistachio gets to know someone she is an affectionate, goofy, and wicked smart girl. She loves to play, get belly rubs, and cuddle on the couch. She is going to require a lot of patience though as even with those she knows she occasionally is sure they are aliens trying to kidnap her. Please research the 'fear period' of German Shepherd behavioral development and understand that in addition to being in the midst of that stage Pistachio also has the added stress of transitions being in rescue. Pistachio loves toys - Kong's, jolly balls, and in a pinch her leash - and is figuring out the premise of fetch. Pistachio has limited experience with children 8+ years of age and given her hesitation towards new people she is not currently recommended for a home with children.\n\nPistachio lives with other dogs in her foster home and does a generally good job. She is unsure of new dogs and tends to be more avoidant initially. She is slowly figuring out how to play and can be a bit rough at first but is also learning how to respect the boundaries other dogs set for her. She currently lives with an adult cat and does a good job respecting her space. She has not been around any young/active cats but as of now we have no reason to think she would do poorly adjusting to a new home with cats.\n\nPistachio is a young girl who is looking for guidance and patience as she figures out her role in a family. She is going to require structured socialization, patience, and lots of love to help her discover the world doesn't have to be scary.

We will not respond to petfinder inquiries regarding any information already publicly posted.** Please take time to read the information provided and complete an application if interested.** Incomplete applications will not be considered.**\n\nHi! My name is Rori! \nI am about 10 months old and I weigh around 32 pounds. I am spayed, current on vaccines, microchipped, and on heartworm and flea prevention. I am a super social girl that is looking for an active home. I am still very much a puppy and need adopters willing to continue socializing and working on all aspects of basic training to help me be the best girl I can be! \nMy adoption fee is $395. \n\nPlease submit an application if you want to make me part of your family! \nMeet and greets are scheduled with approved adopters. \nCopy the link below and paste it into your browser for an application:\n\nhttp://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/wACc22HN2JDb60dtb465Z \n\n\nOur adoption process consists of an application, and reference checks. We do home visits when a reference check is not enough. You must be at least 21 years old to apply to adopt.\nPlease fill out all fields as accurately as possible. We will not process incomplete applications. \n\nAdoptions are made on a best home basis. If two excellent applications come in for the same dog, our policy is first in time, first in line. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs. Our dogs are in private foster homes waiting to be adopted. Due to limited foster space, we are unable to hold an animal to be adopted out at a later time.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents of our dogs and puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. \n\nWe rely solely on adoption fees and donations to provide care for our rescued animals, many of whom have incurred medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The fees received act to help support the organization as a whole, allowing them to continue efforts to rescue animals from high-kill shelters in South Carolina and Georgia.",

If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nIf you are looking for 1 (or 2!) fun puppies, look no further. Trinket and Triscuit are adorable 10 week old female beagle mix puppies. Trinket has an all black head and weighs in at 9 pounds. Triscuit has a white stipe on the face and weighs in at 12.5 pounds. Given their age estimate and size, they could grow to be medium sized dogs, under 50 pounds. They are currently being potty trained, but are pretty good at hitting their pee pee pads. They are super playful and friendly and LOVE the snow! They do fine with other dogs and have not been tested with cats, but are young enough to be ok. They love human interaction and belly rubs!\n\nThis pup is micro-chipped and up to date on all vaccinations, and spayed/neutered. The new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing. The pup's adoption fee is $375. Please note ARF does not approve applications for any puppy under 6 months of age to families that live outside of Illinois and/or beyond 100 miles of Wheaton or Glen Ellyn, IL. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting this pup fill out an online application today! https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/ Once your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting. ARF is an all volunteer organization. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions until your application has been approved. Thank you for your patience!\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nSkippy is a friendly and affectionate 3-4 month old terrier mix puppy. He is around 15 pounds and probably will grow a little more. He is up to date on shots and is microchipped. He will be neutered as of 2/3. He is an active puppy and will require regular walks and exercise. He is working on potty training. Skippy would be a perfect family dog!\n\nThis pup is micro-chipped and up to date on all vaccinations, and neutered. The new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing. The pup's adoption fee is $375. Please note ARF does not approve applications for any puppy under 6 months of age to families that live outside of Illinois and/or beyond 100 miles of Wheaton or Glen Ellyn, IL. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting this pup fill out an online application today! https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/ Once your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting. ARF is an all volunteer organization. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions until your application has been approved. Thank you for your patience!\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thanks for your interest in a pet from A.R.F.! If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nIf you are looking for 1 (or 2!) fun puppies, look no further. Trinket and Triscuit are adorable 10 week old female beagle mix puppies. Trinket has an all black head and weighs in at 9 pounds. Triscuit has a white stipe on the face and weighs in at 12.5 pounds. Given their age estimate and size, they could grow to be medium sized dogs, under 50 pounds. They are currently being potty trained, but are pretty good at hitting their pee pee pads. They are super playful and friendly and LOVE the snow! They do fine with other dogs and have not been tested with cats, but are young enough to be ok. They love human interaction and belly rubs!\n\nThis pup is micro-chipped and up to date on all vaccinations, and spayed/neutered. The new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing. The pup's adoption fee is $375. Please note ARF does not approve applications for any puppy under 6 months of age to families that live outside of Illinois and/or beyond 100 miles of Wheaton or Glen Ellyn, IL. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting this pup fill out an online application today! https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/ Once your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting. ARF is an all volunteer organization. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions until your application has been approved. Thank you for your patience!\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

She\u2019s a Cairn Terrier/Glen of Imaal Terrier mix estimated to be about 5 years old.\nRuffles was dumped at a Walmart parking lot with a softball size lump on her side, curled over claws, and tons of matted hair. She\u2019s always smiling and will give sweet kisses though! Everyone is her friend!\nShe\u2019s been on a weight loss journey starting at 40 pounds and losing about a pound a week (now at 36). One of her fat rolls had caused a yeast patch making her very itchy, but that\u2019s almost gone now! The lump has been removed as well. It was found to be a SCT which is cancerous, but it\u2019s all gone with low chances of coming back or spreading. The vet said it shouldn\u2019t affect her length or quality of life. The removal and weight loss have given her even more vibrancy in her personality! She now plays with toys and her furry foster siblings!\nThis girl loves walks. She lives for walks! And she is just the friendliest wanting to say a sweet hello to all she meets, humans and dogs of all sizes. She\u2019a also an excellent skating partner!\nShe\u2019s a very well behaved pooch. She\u2019s never had an accident. She can go just about anywhere with you which is her greatest desire! She\u2019s been to happy hour, farmer\u2019s market, hikes, boat rides, you name it. She likes to snuggle on the sofa too and is very content in her dog bed at night. She\u2019s really a very adaptable dog as long as she\u2019s with you. \nShe has already been spayed and up to date on shots and is heartworm positive. She has started treatment which is covered by the rescue. \nYou can see more of her foster life on Instagram: @pawsomefoster\nRuffles is ready for a furever home!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nKEANO is sweet, Blue Heeler mix dog. He is about 1 to 2 years of age and his blue merle and tan markings, with a little bit of white, make him a great dog to photograph. Staff likes this dog!  He likes to reach through the bars of his kennel to kiss the hands that are held out to him!  He weighs 46 pounds and he has not yet been neutered. So, please read the important information below.  Then called to schedule an adoption appointment if you would like to meet him in person to make your adoption decision.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you. \n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

            "description": "Dolly is the most affectionate dog you will ever meet! She is never out of kisses for her people and will gladly spend all her time cuddling with you on the couch! Her love for you knows no boundaries and personal space is not something she is very familiar with! She is super dog friendly and loves playing with her foster siblings! She has a major sweet tooth and loves peanut butter treats whenever she can get them! \n\nDolly was kept outside before coming to the rescue. She is house trained but has had an occasional accident when not able to go outside. Side Note: she really does not like going out in the rain!!! ? She does really well out in the house and is content to nap the day away on the couch or on her bed! She is not a big fan of crates, but we have been working with her to be ok if she needs to be in one! She is however, such a good girl that she really does not need to be in one!! She loves car rides and meeting new people! Dolly is such an incredible dog and despite everything she has been through, she is so sweet, gentle, and literally love everyone!! Dolly would be an amazing addition to any home!!\n\nDolly will be spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines prior to adoption. She is currently going through the beginning stages of heartworm treatment.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Dolly, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.",

He is great with other dogs, however we haven\u2019t tested him out around cats. He would be a great family dog, but we haven\u2019t tested him around small children. He is nervous with fast movements or being approached quickly, but hasn\u2019t shown any signs of aggression. He might be better in a home with older children who know how to be gentle. \n\nOtis is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and i the process of heartworm treatment. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Otis, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.",

            "description": "My name is Baby, I am a sweet and gentle 1 year old.  I have not had much attention in life, so I am also quite timid and a bit shy.  My rescuers are not sure what happened to me in the past, but they say I\u2019m a good boy.  I don\u2019t bark or whine and I am super easy.  I am good with other dogs and will be neutered on 2/4.  I\u2019ve also had all my shots.  I am looking for a patient home where I will be loved and will learn that I\u2019m safe.  I\u2019m about 50 pounds right now, but could probably go for gaining a few more pounds.  I like people and children, but would probably do best in a home with older children or with well trained and gentle younger kids who won\u2019t jump on me or scare me.  I do not pull on leash and although I\u2019m a bit scared to go in my crate, I\u2019m great and sleep like a baby once in.  I look forward to having a family of my very own who will love me, play with me and teach me that the world is not a scary place.  In return I will be a great companion and will love you unconditionally.  If you want to know more about me or meet me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com, or text my foster mom, Linda at (707) 326-6114\nLove, Baby",

Hazel is around 5 yrs old. She has the kindest soul and sweetest face ever. She came to us from an overcrowded shelter in the south. She has had some turmoil with dogs attacking her and so she is a little bit on the defensive. \nIf Hazel trust you, she will basically hug you and kiss you. It takes her a minute but we know there is someone out there who can give Hazel what she deserves. She deserves Love, a home with patience and a family that adores her like we do.\nHazel came to us Heartworm positive and has since had her treatment. She is on a 30 day regimen of antibiotics and steroids. She will need to be retested and started on HW prevention ASAP.\nHazel needs to go to a home where she is the only dog. \nShe is spayed, UTD on Vaccinations, and Microchipped.\n",

He is quite active. He enjoys walking in the neighborhood at least twice a day. He is curious and enjoys being outside.\n\nHe can run like the wind to fetch his toy. He is playful with his toys and enjoys a good game of tug.\n\nFranklin is friendly to other dogs that he meets while walking. \n\nHe has not been exposed to cats, however, we do think he would do okay. \n\nFranklin has been around children ranging in age from 15 months to 8 years. He does just fine with children. Tolerant of their noise and fast movements. \n\nHe settles easily in his bed at night beside mine and sleeps through the night. He is eager to meet new people. \n\nHe is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and heartworm negative.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Franklin, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.\n",

She is now 5 months old, thriving, and ready for her forever home. Kaiya is still a puppy so going through the puppy stages but has master potty training and is a very good girl. She is not in a kennel much so that would be a new thing for her, she is out most of the day with me, while I work from home. Let's talk about this \"wiggle butt\" of hers, she is SO happy to greet all the dogs and all the people. She loves other dogs, might even say a little obsessed, she wants to sleep with them, eat with them, and run around with her dogs friends. The perfect home for Kaiya would be one with another dog and a fenced in backyard. Due to her leg injury she would need lots of walks, exercise, and special attention. Kaiya's adoption fee is $300. She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccinations and kept on preventatives. Please apply at www.adoptapal.org/adopt\n\n2/2/21 8:46 AM",

            "description": "This little girl is LULU.  She is available for adoption, but isn\u2019t ready to go home with anyone for about 2 weeks.  She is still being treated for Demodex mange. Demodex is a mite. She isn\u2019t contagious, but needs to get her skin healed up and then spayed before she can go to her adoptive, forever home. \n\nLulu is cute, smart and very lovable and sweet. She is already learning how to sit for treats.   She is about 3 months old.  She is a white Pit Bull terrier.  She will be a big girl when she\u2019s grown.  She\u2019s a puppy so she loves everyone and everything that loves her and is good to her. Dogs, cats, children would all be good for Lulu if they love her right back.   \n\nLulu would love to have a cushy, safe indoor home filled with love and treats. No roaming around for this girl! A safe place to go potty or always on a leash with you to keep her protected - just like all dogs need.   Her fully vetted adoption fee is $95. \n\nVisit Lulu & the others here at the shelter 11AM - 3PM Tuesdays - Saturdays.  If you make a love connection, applications are here at the shelter.  It will not speed up the process to fill out an application ahead of time. Visits are required and all applications are reviewed with the goal of always placing our dogs in the best home for them.\n\n*****\nIf don't have room in your home but do have room in your heart, you can help one of our homeless pets find a home of its own by sponsoring them. By sponsoring, you will be paying part of the adoption fee, making it possible for them to be adopted much sooner. \n            \nFor Adoption or Sponsorship  Information please call 270-586-3125.  \nADOPTION HOURS:  Tuesday - Saturday 11 am to 3 pm Central Time. Adoption Fee for our dogs is $95.  All dogs will be adopted fully vetted.  Spay/Neuter.  Wormed.  Heartworm tested and heartworm preventative administered.   Upon adoption, monthly preventative medications are available at a discounted rate.  \n",

            "description": "Hi my name is Emmy, I am a beautiful 2-year-old female Mountain Cur mix. I love peanut butter,  car rides, walks, and belly rubs. I get along well with my foster brothers and sisters and I can run very fast (which keeps my girlish figure at 45lbs). When I play tag with my brothers and sisters they can't catch me, it is the best game ever.  I am good on a leash, crate trained, house trained and I know my basic commands. I am up to date on my vaccinations, heartworm free, microchipped, and spayed.  I'm good with children of all ages and I like goats but I'm not sure about cats. I'm looking for my forever home, a family that will love me as much as I will love them. I will be loyal and love you forever.  If you have any questions please contact the Hickman Humane Society or ask my foster mom Sheri. If you are interested in adopting me please follow the link listed below. Thank you I hope to see you soon.\nhttps://www.cognitoformsPawzNClawzK9Retreat/.../AdoptionA...",

He likes walking so we do lots of that. Paxton is dog and cat friendly. No small children. He needs slow introduction to new people and is wary of men and loud voices. Once he warms up he is sweet and loves to cuddle. He is being fostered in Naples, FL.  Please call Megan to meet this precious pup 239-963-5367.",

I\u2019m an energetic 45ish pounds that loves to play fetch and playing in the kiddie pool.  I love the water!  Being a curious pup at just 2 years old, there is a whole world for me to experience.  I\u2019m looking for a family that is active and that will play with me, do fun things with me.  I am very sweet and will make a great companion.  In my foster home, I currently have a dog friend and we get along fine, but since I\u2019m young I could use some social skills.  I can be a bit awkward trying to play with new dogs, so well balanced, well socialized dog friends might be best.  I love treats and my foster dad says I am smart and eager to please.  I love to get tummy rubs, and I often will run up to you, roll over on my back and wait to get my tummy rubbed.  I can be very silly around my humans, but that\u2019s because I love them so much!  I am crate trained and I\u2019m a good girl.  Some of the words my foster dad uses to describe me are cuddly, gentle, goofy, playful and very sweet.  I am hoping I get a family of my very own who will love me, play with me and give me the attention I so enjoy.  In return you will get the most sweet and cuddly companion you ever had.  If you want to know more about me or meet me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com.\nLove, Jazzy",

He does want to chase cats and chickens though, so NO CATS OR CHICKENS.. He is doing wonderful with his house manners and is crate trained and housebroken. He is 1.5 years old. He can be shy with strangers ( especially men ) as we are sure he came from an abusive situation and his previous male owner dumped him down a side road. He just needs the chance to warm up and then he will be your 65lb lap dog best buddy. He is doing well with his basic obedience, food motivated. His biggest accomplishment has been learning to walk nice on a leash and not drag a human. He is very strong thus we found a no-pull easy walk harness is the perfect solution. He does wonderful in a fully fenced yard, he doesn't try to climb over or dig under. Bear loves children but may do better in a home that doesn't have toddlers because he doesn't realize he is a big dog. He is wonderful at the Vet clinic, to bathe and trim nails . Since Bear is the happiest in the colder weather, snow days are a blast, we feel that TN is not where he needs to reside forever. He does take a bit of extra bribery to get him back inside when the weather is cool. He loves to just lounge in the yard contently and is such a great outdoorsy dog. Colder weather states will be his new BEST FRIEND place to live! Bear is a big fluffy ball of fun and entertainment and is looking for his forever home.",

            "description": "Are you looking for a little moppy haired pooch?\nCheck out Chewie!!\n\nThis boy has stolen his foster moms heart and he could steal yours too in time. \n\nChewie is not the most sociable pup right now but that's because he's been conditioned to stay out of the way by his former family. They couldn't give him the attention he deserves so they surrendered him to us to find him a perfect home. \nThis poor guy spent the first 3 yrs of his life crated or left outside. He will often go lay in a corner or another room by himself. He frequently wants to go out, in any weather, probably because he spent so much time loose outside he's comfortable there. \n\nChewie loves to be cuddled and pet, as long as your standing. It seems he wasn't allowed to cuddle on the couch and he will immediately jump down if he's taken to sit anywhere. Maybe you could teach him it's ok to cuddle on the couch!\n\nChewie was never fully housebroken, but has made huge strides in his foster home and rarely has accidents. He is crate trained and sleeps in his crate. He's okay on leash and working on other manners. \nAs of yet, he shows no desire to play with toys or interact with the resident dogs, but that could change over time as he's young. \nHe would do well being with another small dog to learn from, or he'd be ok alone with proper attention.\n \nA fenced yard or area is a MUST since he has a need to be outside often and would wander the neighborhood, if given the chance. \n\nAre you up for the challenge to help Chewie be the best dog he can be? \nDo you have the time, patience and love to give this little guy? \nChewie has so much potential to be a great companion in the right home. \n\nHe's bound to be popular so get your application in soon!\n\nName: Chewie\nBreed: Pekingese - Chihuahua mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 3.5 yrs\nWeight: 10 lbs\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Neg.\nMicrochipped: Yes\nMedical: Chewie has a grade 3/4 luxating patella in his right knee that may need attention as he gets older. \n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Yes\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

Adapting to a new situation takes a \"minute \". But henceforth has had no further accidents. She's a good pal to my Blue Heeler, and my cat is cool with her. She's very eager to please. She knows \"sit\", \"down\" (lay down),  \"off\" and comes to calls, whistles or clapping. We're working on \"stay\" and we're so close. She loves cuddles and lovins. She needs to run and exercise every day. She loves busy toys like antler. She's just a swell little dog. Apply to adopt at fromforgottentoforever.com/adoptionapplication/.\n",

I MUST return to our AHC for my scheduled appointments. I will have to be leash walked only and kept calm. I may be a little bit more work than some of the other dogs here, but I know I am worth it.

            "description": "Copper the wonderdog is ready for you! This 17 year old sweet as pie scruffy boy has received a clean bill of health and is now looking for love just in time for Valentines day. Copper loves to shuffle around and explore his surroundings and although quite an elderly gent has been newly housetrained (who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks), and is busy learning all about the importance of the odd snuggle and cuddle too. Copper is a fairly independent fellow but he is always up for one of his favourite snacks or belly rub too. When Copper arrived into care he was a bit of a disaster medically but thanks to a lot of love and work on the part of his foster home he is now able to live his best life. In his previous home, Copper lead quite a secluded life so it took some time to build up trust and a relationship in his new home. But now- he's just one of the gang and lives happily with the other dog in his home. Copper is also cat friendly and apartment friendly too. Once in a while, due to a weak back end (which is getting better with movement and exercise), Copper will have a slight poop accident if he is super relaxed. But at 17, sometimes accidents and poop happens. It's an easy clean up and isn't often at all. After many discussions with our vet clinic, it was in Copper's best interest to not neuter him at his age. He's just looking for a quiet, hanging out lifestyle with chances to explore his surroundings at an old man pace with plenty of naps in between. Copper loves his mealtimes, is good in the car, and did we mention he loves snacks? So if you think he sounds like the quiet older gentleman who would be perfect in your home, applications to adopt are available on our website at www.happysplace.ca. Copper is being fostered near to London ON and is $450.00 to adopt.",

            "description": "My name is Nova and I am 5 years old and a 70 pound squishy bundle of love.  I am a smart and affectionate girl who is eager to please.  I am a lover of people and will pull to get close to them so I can curl up at their feet for love and affection. I am also a protector of my family.  I enjoy being pet, scratched and loved on.  If I don\u2019t\u2019 get enough affection, I can be pushy about letting you know I want more.  I\u2019m a girl who knows what she wants.  I\u2019m pretty much a puppy in a big, goofy body.  I am energetic and playful.  I love being a lap dog, but my foster mommy says I can\u2019t be a lap dog because I am too big.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good reason.  I think the bigger the dog the more to love!   Since I don\u2019t seem to know my own size, I am working on boundaries.  I\u2019m a smart girl, I love treats and am eager to learn new things.  I am looking for a family of my very own that will give me the love and attention I so desire, will play with me, and will have the patience to continue my training to make me the best girl I can be.  In return you will get a fun, playful and loyal best friend who will always be by your side.  Check out my pictures, I\u2019m pretty cute.  If you would like to meet me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at: martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com\nLove, Nova",

            "description": "HANK! What a perfectly wonderful houndy face! This 8 year old, 59 pound hound boy is described by his foster family as the most snuggly and sweet boy ever. Hank adores people and is the perfect blend of let\u2019s get up and go on an outdoor adventure and let\u2019s snuggle and snuggle even more on the sofa too. Found as a stray, Hank arrived into our care with some fur loss and a cough. With both of those well behind him now, he is a healthy fellow who is ready to live his best life with you! We can\u2019t stress enough that although senior in age, Hank LOVES his active lifestyle. He loves walks and hikes and is happiest after he has had the chance to burn off some energy. Hank will require an adopter who is okay to help him work through a bit of his anxieties. He is overall a bit of a nervous dog until he settles into a new space and although we don\u2019t know for sure, we imagine it is because he was not well socialized before. So what this means is a lot of things startle him. For instance- his own reflection in the mirror and loud noises. Using a calm and reassuring voice as well as time for positive experiences to grow his world has and will continue to help Hank become more and more comfortable too. Hank is a curious boy with a the nose of a hound so a fenced yard is an absolute must for him please. Sometimes Hank can be a bit mouthy when he gets really excited in his play but his mouth is always very gentle. Through an adopter who will remain committed to positive reinforcement training and relationship building with Hank, this handsome boy will continue to blossom and thrive. Known currently as a \u201cVelcro-dog\u201d meaning he always wants to be right by your side and as close as possible, Hank will also be looking for an adopter that doesn\u2019t mind this part of him too. Hank has not had cat experience at all so to be safe we will be looking for a home without cats. Hank is very curious about dogs he sees on walks and was temperament tested in shelter as friendly with dogs, however does not currently live with other dogs. Due to the amount of snuggling he likes to do with his people, he may prefer to be the only dog in his home to continue to soak up all of the cuddles he can too. If you think Hank might be the perfect dog for you, you\u2019ll find applications to adopt on our website at www.happypslace.ca where is adoption fee is $450.00 to adopt. Hank is currently being fostered in the Burlington ON area.",

This is his past story ( 3 years ago)\n   My mom found out she had a very aggressive form of cancer and went for her first chemo on October 8. She came home and I kept her company until Oct 13, when she went to the Emergency Room and then to ICU. I was sure she would be back soon. Friends came and stayed nights with me at the house. Then more time passed, and days became weeks, and I just found out she is not coming home to me.\nMy mom was single and there is no one to take me. \nA friend found me a most awesome foster mom, who is being very patient, loving and nurturing, but she too has other animals to juggle, so I cannot stay long. I love to snuggle, am very quiet and sweet. I love to play with my favorite toy, squeaky cow ball, and sometimes I like to play a little keep away. Belly rubs and long walks are 2 favorites and I am learning to walk very well on a leash. I used to have a big fenced back yard and that would be cool to have again !  I am house broken and am used to being inside as much as I was outside. I am 80 lbs and very strong. Up to date on all my shots. I can sit and shake, but that is about the extent of my education, but I want to be the very best dog I can be, so I am going to a local training facility starting December 5, for 2 full weeks of Boarding and TRAINING !  So, whoever is lucky enough to adopt me is going to get not just a great snuggler, but a well trained pup !\nFast forward, Bounder found a wonderful home, and his training went great.  He is a great boy, who until COVID, was being walked, going with his new family places, and living a great life.   \nHis human family feel they cannot give Bounder the true home he needs to thrive now.  Bounder needs an active family that wants to go hiking, walking, and playing with him.  Bounder's current mom and dad are doing the best they can, but are unable to keep up with his activity level needs and want only what is best for him\nBounder loves loves loves all people, including kids, does well with other dogs and did I say he loves his spot on the couch.  He is crate trained but his crate stays open as he uses it for his safe place as so many dogs do.   He is such a good happy boy, who is ready for his family.. house trained, basic commands,  ( On my first meet with him, he sat, shaked, down, stay, and heeled walking with me)  Oh and I got kisses.\nIf you think Bounder is the guy for you, please fill out the on line application, link below\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/\n",

            "description": "Dallas is around a 1yr old, 56lbs and a Catahoula mix. He has the most adorable heart on his belly! This sweet boy came to the Humane Society after being picked up in Monroe. He had been wondering the streets for a long time, often spotted throughout the town until one day he was finally captured. Although shy at first, Blue quickly bubbled into a loving, bundle of joy. Blue has done great in his foster home! He is fairly potty trained but does enjoy frequent potty breaks\u2014 as he is not used to living inside. This sweet boy will do wonderfully in a home without cats or other small animals and finds it easier to play with any new brothers or sisters after getting used to them first. Blue has grown to love being inside with a warm bed and plenty of food and treats. While he will always be ready to play with his favorite ball or go on walks, his favorite pastime is snuggling up for some pets and a nap next to his caretakers. You\u2019ll find that Blue is happiest by your side wherever you may be going. He would love to be a part of every adventure that his future family goes on. Please fill out your adoption application today at www.hsuc.org.\n\n",

            "description": "Have you ever met a dog that's, well, REALLY mischievous and you think-\"hoo that dog is a LOT\"-- So, take your estimation of \"a LOT\" and multiply that by like, 100 and you might come close to the BALL O' PERSONALITY that is Buckaroo \"Buck\" Rogers.  Buck may look full grown but he is alllll puppy (We estimate that he is less than a year old). He is really good about being housetrained, Is an awesome snuggler and has really gotten down the phrase \"WHAT IS IN YOUR MOUTH FOR THE LOVE OF..\"  Buck likes toys, people, people giving him toys, toys that are not really toys, but are actually things like hairdryers or that old pot that you had tomatoes in last year.  Buck tries VERY hard to be a good boy and most of the time he gets pretty close and even when he's not particularly succeeding, he's such a funny boy that you can't help but love him. He loves other dogs, but they like to tolerate him in smaller doses as he still thinks playing Bitey Face is hilarious. He's a Springer Spaniel, so close to 50lbs of goofiness.  Buck would REALLY appreciate a home were he can get a lot of play time and exercise! (he's good on a leash, go figure!) \n\nInterested in adoption? We are not currently accepting out of state (Texas) applications. Springer Spaniel Experience is a definite plus!  Adopters must have an approved application on file with us. You can find that application on our website at www.austincockerrescue.org",

Mom is a cocker spaniel (who also weighs 25 lbs/Dad is the yorkie who is smaller). Whoever adopts Buddy Luv will need to have knowledge and/or experience with separation anxiety. Although it's not as bad as it once was, the issue still needs to be addressed.\n\nHe is very energetic and  needs a fenced yard so he is free to run and play as much as he wants.  The family we got him from has his best interest at heart. They were very upfront that they are not the best family/home for him. And they love him enough to reach out to us for help. So NO negatives please.\n\nThings were good when they were working from home and were able to spend time with him. But recently, they had to return to work and that was very hard for him.  He started acting differently. Without warning, he has snapped at different family members, biting two of them. They took him to the vet to see if maybe there was something wrong. Possibly there was an issue  causing him pain, thus making him lash out. The vet found nothing.\n\nOur rescue took him with the hope of finding him the right home with a family who knows his story and still wants to do whatever it takes to help him with whatever he needs. \n\nThis person has to be a patient individual/family who is ready to welcome him into their family/home and give him the love and attention he deserves.\n\nWe feel like being able to have outside time and be with his owners all day will help things.. *We ask that no bashing be done towards his former owners. They truly want what is best for him, as do we.*\n\n Thank you!",

            "description": "Spongebob is a 15 year old sweetheart who is looking for a retirement home. He is a very sweet boy who was dumped on a road by his \"owners\" is horrible condition. Our wonderful foster, who is also a groomer, got him all fixed up and looking good again. He seems to feel a LOT better, too! \n\nWe think Spongebob would do best in a quieter home without children, only because we believe he deserves to be the \"baby\" of his family for the remainder of his life. He has done well with other dogs, but calmer dogs who can give him his space would be preferred for this little guy. We think he may have some vision problems, but that isn't unusual given his age, but another reason to get him into a quieter, calmer home. \n\nHis foster mom does use a belly band on him when he is in the house, but that is only because with old age, comes a little incontinence. It is completely normal, and shouldn't deter anyone from adopting. If you're looking for a cuddle or nap buddy, I can guarantee that Spongebob is your guy! He is said to sleep most of the time, so a nice couch, or a comfy doggie bed to crash on would be perfect!\n\nInterested? Great! Submit an application at www.caninecastawaysrescue.org. The application approval process can take up to 7 business days. Once approved, we will contact you for that highly anticipated meet and greet with your whole family, including any existing dogs in your home!",

            "description": "Ollie is a drop-dead gorgeous 2-1/2 year old Pyr, weighing in at about 110lbs. Ollie loves people and enjoys playing with other dogs, but he would prefer to be the only dog in his home and not have to share his toys or people with another dog. He is good with dog-savvy cats, but will chase to play. He LOVES to be outside (typical Pyr), walks well on a leash, and needs a home with a fenced yard that he can hang out in during inclement weather when any sane animal would be inside. No kids under 12 for this big boy. Pyr experience is preferred.  He is currently is but can travel anywhere we do. If you want to learn more about Ollie, please complete an applicatio and then reach out to Jen.Lu@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

He loves to play with other dogs and is all things puppy. Lock up your shoes!. If you would like to learn more an=bout Ralphie, please complete an application and then reach out to Mandy@bigfluffydogs.com.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "Kennedy is a 1-1/2 yr old Aussie/GSD mix and 80lbs of hunka-hunka gorgeous. He Loves people, loves other dogs, dog-savvy cats only, and kids over 12 because he will knock them  down in his youthful enthusiasm for life. He needs a home  with a fenced in yard, another dog to play with, and humans who are home more often than not. He is currently in Knoxville, TN but  he can travel anywhere we do along the east coast and into the Midwest.  If you would like to learn more about Kennedy, please complete an application and then reach out to Jen.Lu@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

A  good Samaritan  took  her  in, but does  not  have  the resources to  keep  her permanently. \nGypsy is a 1 1/2 year  old  female  GSD.  She is up to date on vaccines and is spayed.   \n\nGypsy  is  described as  passive  and friendly, to people  and  dogs.  However,  she  is  fearful in  new  situations  and  people,  she  will  run  and  hide. \n\nGypsy  likes  other  dogs but we  are  not  sure  about  cats.   \n\nShe  would  do best in a  home  with  some  GSD  experience. We are  unsure  if  she  is  good  with  kids,  she  has  lived in  an  adults only  home. She  will  climb a  fence  and  should  not  be left alone  unattended outside. \n\nShe is  used to  living in a  home.   Since  she is  young  she  will  need a home  where she  can  stay  active. \n \nGypsy is housebroken, leash  trained, and crate trained.  Her ideal  home would  have a stable routine  and  consistency,  with few  people  coming in  and  out of the  house so  she  will be  comfortable.\n\nTo meet Gypsy,  please contact  slcwiggins@gmail.com directly.",

She loves hitting the trails and the lakes. She does get a long with most dogs, but can be dog selective. She has lived with cats, but Carla does love to chase. With that being said she needs to be monitored in a fenced in yard, unless the fencing is higher. She gets along with kids and all adults, but does do much better as the dominant dog in the home. Please only serious inquires only. She will only go to an approved home, and like I stated. Must be an active home.",

He is a lab/shepherd mix and we expect he will be a big boy in the 50-60 pound range. Clyde is still working on his potty training, is sleeping through the night in a crate with his sister, and will need to start his leash training in his forever home. His foster mom says \"\"he is very sweet and loves snuggles and belly/face rubs. He is playful yet can be a bit lazy as he loves nap and snuggle time. He can be a bit goofy and I find myself laughing at some of the things he does, never fails to put a smile on my face!\"\" Clyde is still all puppy and has a lot to say, so he will need structure and work on his basic commands. He is a typical mouthy puppy so older kiddos or a family who can work through this phase. He loves to be outside wrestling with his sister, lounging in the grass or on plants. He would love a canine sibling and a yard to play in with humans who will introduce him to the outside world on many adventures. \n\nIf you would like to meet Clyde please fill out an adoption application on our website and an adoption coordinator will be in contact.http://therescueddog.org/dog-adoption-application/",

I came to these nice people at FDHS after my previous owners could no longer care for me. I did live with another dog in my previous home, but can be selective with some of the other guys here in the kennels. Loud noises and sudden movements do tend to make me nervous, so I'm looking for a slower-pace lifestyle. But don't let my passive nature fool you entirely, I can be a bit of an escape artist, so supervised outside-time would be necessary. I am very sweet with all of the humans I have met here so far and don't seem to have much of an issue with anything, other than not wanting to be alone. I am estimated to be around 8 years old, am spayed, and am up-to-date on vaccines and prevention.",

            "description": "Hi there, my name is Luna. And like my name I know you'll be over the moon for me. I am a beautiful one year old husky. Like my breed I am a very active goofy girl who will make a wonderful adventure buddy. My ideal family would have a home with a yard and give me lots of exercise. I would be happy to have another playful dog in my home but I can also live alone. I like kids and would probably do best with older or dog savvy children. I am completely potty trained, crate trained and love my dog bed. I am still working to perfect my basic commands and how to walk properly on a leash so a training class will be helpful. Lastly I love entertaining myself with tennis balls and toys.\n\nI really am a wonderful gal. If I sound like your perfect match let's meet. I can't wait to be your buddy, go on adventures and curl up by your side.\n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come first-serve basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal, applications may take up to 48 hours to complete.\n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. Luna's adoption fee is $200. If you are interested in adopting Luna, or another CAWS animal, please fill out an application here: http://caws.org/adoption-application. If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at https://caws.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Hi my name is Magic. If you want a little Magic in your life I'm the girl for you. I'm an 8 month old Australian Shepherd/Heeler/Lab mix. I am house trained. I'm still in my puppy stage and need lots of training and tons of love and patience. I'm so smart and very playful. I'm high energy and need a family that can help chanel that energy. I love to go on car rides, I love to chase the ceiling fan, the airplanes, and I love the snow and I'm so adorable to watch as I chase it. I'm learning to heal, sit and stay. I do like my crate. I love to chew everything like puppies do. Keep your socks put away or they'll become a toy for play.

I am a small, 9-year-old Miniature Pinscher who loves attention and playing with my toys. My favorite thing to do is cuddle with my humans and I would be happy sitting on someone's lap all day. I also love to cover up with my blanket when I sleep or am laying around. I enjoy running around in the yard, I'm really fast, but I do need a fence because I cannot be let loose. I can jump really high and everyone thinks it's quite funny. I do this when I get excited to get a treat. I love to go for walks, but I am a bit of a homebody and don't like going out many places. I am loyal and would love you forever if you choose me to be your new companion.",

            "description": "Zelda is the sweetest, wiggliest dog you'll ever meet! She doesn't know a stranger, and shows her excitement over meeting people by wiggling her whole body. Zelda showed up on someone's property one day and was taken in & loved by the property owner. Her world was turned upside down when one of her owners died - she spent three months acting a bit off, like she was waiting for him to come home. Life happens and the survivng owner is no longer able to care for her. She was heartbroken about leaving Zelda behind, but Zelda is such a sweet girl that we know she will be adopted quickly!\nZelda was taken to obedience classes where she learned how to sit, stay, \"\"wait\"\" for a treat on the ground, and lay down. She also does this very cute low bark when you ask her to \"\"say please\"\" for a treat! Zelda prefers the company of cats to dogs! She will happily share her bed with any feline friend willing to snuggle. She has gotten along with dogs, but she can be a bit picky, so a meet and greet with potential dog siblings is required for her. Zelda walks well on a harness, but she is a strong girl and sometimes gets focused on things out of her path. She'll need to be corrected on this behavior (she's so smart that we don't think it'll take long to figure out). She is house-trained and used to having a dog door to come in and leave as she pleases. Without a dog-door, she will sit by the \"\"outside\"\" door until she is let out. Zelda is also crate trained! She loves sleeping in the human bed, but sometimes prefers the comfort of her own crate (if you leave her crate door open, she'll spend some time in there on her own throughout the day). She does wonderful on car rides! Her favorite toys are anything that squeaks, and cat siblings that will play chase with her - she has never hurt a cat, she just likes to run with them! \nZelda is the sweetest girl and we know she is not her happiest self here. She would be happiest in a home with someone where she can snuggle on the couch and enjoy her people being around.\nDOB: 01/23/2018 Weight: 60lbs...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks.

His perfect home would have a fenced yard for running & playing, another dog to be his partner in crime and a boy or girl to be his best friend. Slate will benefit from puppy training, or obedience classes, this is also an excellent way to bond with your new pup. If you are interested in Slate, fill out an adoption application and make an appointment to come by and meet Slate today!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

            "description": "Snowball is a 6 year old, 65 lb Retriever/Spaniel mix who came to us from a rural shelter where he wasn't having any luck finding a home. He is a very shy guy who will benefit from a patient owner who is willing to give him lots of time to settle in. Snowball is familiar with living in a house, but prefers to have access to outside. He enjoys trotting around the yard, smelling the grass and the trees and watching the world go by. While it takes him a while to warm up to people, he does seem to enjoy belly rubs and will give little tail wags when he is feeling more comfortable. He is exceptionally quiet and doesn't require much; he is a homebody and doesn't really want to go for walks or be a travelling companion, he just wants to lounge at home and be there for you when you get home from a long day of work. Snowball will require a little extra time to familiarize himself with your home and learn to trust, but we think he will bond very closely to the person who can give him that and can be a successful family pet! Snowball does well with other dogs and may even benefit from a confident canine sibling to help him settle in. He would do well with older kids who are familiar with shy dogs and would greatly benefit from an enclosed yard. Snowball will also do okay with dog-savvy cats.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment.

            "description": "Meet Beautiful Omega!\n\nOmega is a Chow mix female, aged 3 years. She has a pretty dark brown coat, blue black tongue and sparkling eyes. She is a sweetie and loves, loves, loves belly rubs! She will roll over and offer her belly to anyone! She is a good dog, but she does have a taste for chickens, so poultry siblings are not in her future. \n\nOmega was surrendered to us for responsible rehoming after her people fell on hard times. She is receiving wonderful care here at the shelter, but she would rather be in a nice, comfortable home! She tested negative for heart worms and is receiving monthly parasite preventatives. She is spayed, fully vaccinated and ready for immediate adoption. Please call us at 580-252-7387 or send us a message on Facebook to meet Omega.For more information, please email Stephens County Humane Society at schs@att.net, or call us at 580-252-7387 (PETS). Our animals are spayed/neutered, UTD on shots, and treated for ticks, & fleas. Cats are tested for FeLV & FIV; and dogs are tested for heart worms.\n\nNormal adoption fee for cats is $75.00; and $100.00 for dogs, but we frequently have specials running and/or animals who have had their adoption fee sponsored, so ... call us! Let us help you find your next fur-baby!",

            "description": "This sweet baby is Daisy she is a Beagle mix around 32#, she is coming from a rural Mississippi shelter where she was hoping to be adopted so we offered to find her a forever home here. She is a sweet girl but can be a tad shy at first, she does well with other dogs but unsure of cats. She has been fostered in a home somewhat but will most likely still need a little direction in this part, along with some leash manners. She has now been completely vetted and is coming to WI and find out how good life can be here for a doggy like her. If interested an online application can be found at SandiPaws.org\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets.
