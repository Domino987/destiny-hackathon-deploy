            "description": "Huey was owned by a ranch hand who left the ranch and left Huey behind. When no one else at the ranch paid him much attention, Huey went wandering. For 4 months, he wandered a country neighborhood alone, following families on their walks with their dogs and playing with dogs along their fence lines, but was unwilling to let anyone catch him. He just didn't trust humans enough to let them come close.\n He spent both excruciatingly hot and freezing cold days laying out in the elements, in plain sight, but uncatchable. Animal control tried for 3 months. Neighbors tried to entice him into yards. The kind neighbors kept him fed, but he still wouldn't trust anyone. \nFinally a trapper stepped in and set a trap for him. A couple of days later, while checking the trap, the trapper was startled to look up and see him watching her. She watched him as he ambled by the trap location and down the street. She followed from a distance and found he had wandered into a neighbors fenced yard to play with her dog. A closed gate, snare, a can of vienna sausage snacks and an hour later, and he was on his way to a new life. \nAt first, he flinched when touched, having forgotten the sensation. But with time and love he has tuned into a big, lovable baby who adores attention. He has no concept of his size and would prefer to be a lap dog. He is fairly low energy and is happy napping on the couch or outside in the sun. He walks well on a leash, but has a bit of fear about getting into the car that he is working on. He enjoys a hike at the park, but doesn't need a lot of high energy exercise to be happy. \nHe loves toys, but mostly just carrying them around and trying to bury them in the yard. \nHe enjoys other dogs, especially smaller ones. He might take a bit of an adjustment period with other large dogs, but he has become friends with every dog he has met eventually. \nHe mostly sleeps on a dog bed, but once in awhile climbs up into bed to cuddle. He will chew on things you leave on the floor if you're not careful, but he's not a destructive chewer generally and does well left out at home unsupervised. \nHe is not a fan of a kennel, but can be kenneled if necessary. \nHuey just needs love and a lifetime supply of dog chow to be happy. He'll even give you the biggest butt wiggles you have ever seen when you walk through the door. What more could a human ask for?\n",

            "description": "Odie was found living on the streets in a neighborhood where loose dogs unfortunately go largely unnoticed. But when a good samaritan realized he was never going to  a home and sleeping on the side of a road, she called us to trap him. He would sit quietly on the side of a busy road as people passed him by, until they looked his way. As soon as someone seemed to notice him, he would take off in fear. Our team set a trap for him and within a couple of days, some hot rotisserie chicken coaxed him into the trap and he was suddenly off the streets.\nIt only took a few days and some serious loving before it was clear that someone had loved him in his life before. Odie was already house-trained, loved snuggles and kids, and could charm the pants off of anyone. But his family has not been found. \nAfter a few months in his foster home. the unthinkable happened. While his foster mom was away, something sparked a fight among his foster brothers. While all of the dogs were injured, Odie took the brunt of it. He nearly didn't make it. It has taken thousands of dollars, 4 surgeries, and 2 long months for Odie to recover and once again become the silly, happy guy we know. Through all of the ordeal, Odie has maintained his usual sunny attitude and never felt sorry for himself. One of his ears has moved high on his head and he got a bit of an unneeded face lift. He is now back to taking walks and living his best life and is once again looking for a new spot to call forever.\n\nFrom Odie's foster mom:\nIt is said that when you adopt a dog, they\u2019re a part of your world, but to them, you\u2019re their whole world. This dog, Odie, is so beautiful, so wonderful, so special, that he will be someone\u2019s whole heart. It is his fate. And he deserves it.  He has been an absolute joy to foster. Zero accidents, zero destruction. He\u2019s a complete looney who can self entertain. He hugs like it\u2019s the last hug you\u2019ll ever have or need. When first leashed, he\u2019ll send you flying down a set of stairs at Mach 3. You\u2019ll want to work on that one. He\u2019s eager to learn and please. He\u2019ll follow you wherever you go, forever.  He\u2019s 45-47lb and is two-ish yrs old. World\u2019s softest fur; low shedder. He gets along well with other dogs, but does appreciate animals who give him personal space. Is fun at the dog park. Want a sensitive, sweet, party animal\u2014 one who has the potential for service work or being a young child\u2019s soulmate \u2014 want someone this amazing in your life?  He\u2019s looking for you, too! \n\n",

Does great with other dogs with a proper introduction and loves to rough & tumble play. \n/Big lover boy, enjoys a belly rub and a good roll in the grass or nap on the couch. \n/Professional sunbather. \n/Thrives on structure and fully obedience trained. Needs a special family (or person) to continue his routine and keep him sharp. \n/Comes with free refresher lessons for life & a trainer who loves him with all of her heart at your beck & call. \nNo kids\nNo cats\n\nHe loves walks, but tires out pretty quickly.

            "description": "Everyone needs a big lover boy Kail in their life! When you walk into foster moms house, you will be greeted by a big wiggly boy holding his latest favorite toy (usually a de-stuffed dog toy thats WAY too small for him). He will prance around the house until youre settled and then sit patiently RIGHT in front of you until you pet him. Take too long? Get ready for him to, gingerly, give you his paw just as a reminder that he is right there (just in case you cant see him). Kail is just like other 75lb dogs - he thinks his rightful place is in your lap. Kail is well mannered though and knows to wait for permission until he can come up on the couch. If he doesnt have permission, he will begrudgingly lay at your feet or on a near by dog bed. If he can come up, he will lay right next to you with at least a paw on your lap. Kails love of humans doesnt stop at adults. He loves any kids he meets and is so incredibly gentle. However, when he plays he doesnt know where his body is. Kail (and young kids) would need more training to make sure hes not knocking anyone over.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to play, he loves to play fetch or tug-of-war with his big rope. Ready for an adventure? Kails in too! He LOVES to go on runs with his foster family, just not every day and slower than 9-minute miles please. Kail also loves to hike and is working on his trail manners. He is also treadmill trained but would much rather be outside on walks and runs with his family for his exercise! Kails also excited to try his hand at cross country skiing once there is enough snow because he LOVES the snow so why not combine two of his favorite things?!? You will know when hes happy and ready to go because he gets on his racer Kail ears.\n\nKail lives with his foster sister, Luna, and loves her! However, he appreciates slow introductions and no face-to-face introductions as the first hello. Kail tends to like confident dogs (no matter their size!), however some smaller dogs might not like when he tries to play. Hes worked SO hard on his dog-friendliness and would love a forever home that will continue to advocate for him, be his alpha dog, and continue to work with him!\n\nKail already knows all of his basic commands - sit, down, shake, and wait. He is currently working on spot and come! He is also leashed trained so no pulling here! Kail will need continued practice to keep his skills sharp!\n\n\nKails story is still waiting to be written by his forever family! His first decided they didnt have time for him anymore. At only 3.5 years old, will you give this lover boy a chance and let him be a part of your family forever?\n \n\n\n \n\nKail playing: https://youtu.be/q9PbozJvkcE\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration",

He is also looking for home without shared walls (no apartments or townhomes). \n\nJake will need consistent training and patience to help him with his uncertainty around new humans. He is a pro at supporting social distancing and takes multiple visits (with lots of high value treats) to warm up to someone. Once he is comfortable with someone, his personality comes through and he loves ear scratches, belly rubs and playing with his toys. \n\nHe will also need a home familiar with the Aussie breed. He has all the traits that have been bred into his Aussie background. A home committed to nurturing his busy Aussie lifestyle, mentally and physically will be important. If you give Jake an inch, he will run a mile \u2013 his forever home will need to ensure he knows that he does not run the house. \n\nJake needs a kid-free and cat-free home but would do alright with another dog in the home provided there are slow, controlled introductions and ample time for both dogs to decompress once Jake is in his forever home. Jake likes to play with other dogs but can be a little pushy around toys when he wants them. \n\nJake is looking for a home where he will be loved, provided with consistent training, and given ample opportunities to get his Aussie energy out!\n\n\n\n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\nInterested in adopting and/or learning more?

            "description": "Born December 2018, Klondike is a 95-pound teen-pup that came to us from a shelter. He probably lived in a home at one time because he is potty trained and will sleep in a crate with no fuss. This teenager is learning doggy manners. With exercise, mental stimulation (enrichment), and appropriate chewing toys like a Nylabone, Klondike is learning what is acceptable.  He enjoys playing with a tennis ball to release energy before a walk. This seems to really soothe him. \n\nHe needs to continue fear-free dog training to help build confidence. New environments and experiences cause anxiety so baby steps for this pup.  He may benefit from having a young female companion but no small pets of any kind. He thrives with structure and enjoys affection.  \n\n**Northern Breed & Force-Free Dog Training Experience Required** \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering Klondike, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application. You may also complete an application online thru our web site, www.CHAAMP.org\n\nCHAAMP accepts applications ONLY from Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington DC. The information on your application will help CHAAMP determine which of our dogs is a good match for you and your family, based upon your lifestyle, other pets, etc. A home visit is required prior to all adoptions. Many of our dogs are fostered in private homes and cannot be visited until you have been approved for adoption. \n\nADOPTION FEE is $275.00  \n\nAll dogs are microchipped, spayed, and neutered and up to date on vaccines. These fees help us cover these costs.  The rates are higher for puppies because they require more visits to the vet and shots. \n\nCHAAMP IS NOT A SHELTER. We are volunteers over a 7-state area dedicated to helping Malamutes in our rescue area. You can read more about Malamutes and about CHAAMP by visiting www.CHAAMP.org",

            "description": "Please note following information of what Lilly and her sister Leah need in an adoptive family:\n\nSINCE LEAH AND LlLLY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE THEY WERE BORN, NOW ARE JUST OVER ONE YEAR OLD, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THEM. SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR A HOME WHERE THEY CAN BE ADOPTED TOGETHER.  \n\nLilly will need a home where the family is patient with her and willing to give her the time she needs to adapt and feel comfortable. It takes her a while to warm up to people and to trust them so it won\u2019t be an immediate or overnight connection. The family that adopts her should be willing to take it slow with her and expect to wait several weeks to months until she shows that she is learning to trust.  Lilly will bond more closely to women, so a relationship with a female could develop fairly quickly, but it will take her a longer time to adjust to any males in the house. When people they know come to visit her foster home, Lilly is friendly with those she knows, but uncomfortable with strangers, especially males. \n \nThe same can be said for Leah, but Leah is less social than Lilly. Leah is more fearful and sometimes will growl when she is unsure or uncomfortable. She will need a longer period of time to adjust to a home. People that adopt Leah need to understand that she is timid and fearful of new  situations and they will have to be willing to be patient over an extended period of time, not pushing or trying to rush her, but allowing her to go at her own pace.\n\nYoung children will be too stressful for the girls. They both will need homes where people are experienced with dogs and are willing to take the time to win their trust. This is going to be a long process and not an immediate bonding.  \n\nThe girls are used to running freely in the yard so a fenced in yard is needed.  Lilly and Leah love to walk and go for daily long walks.  They also meet people along the way, which helps with socialization. They are comfortable in a crate can be crated and for up to five hours daily.  If someone worked away from home, that would be OK, but they could not for be crated for a full work-day.\n\nUpdate 6/13/2020. Lilly and Leah are sisters who had a difficult start in life. They were found under an abandoned building and this is the message \nthat Furry Friends Network received from the shelter that rescued them. \n\n\"They were pulled from under an outbuilding and had not been handled until yesterday. But they are curious little tykes, probably about 8 weeks old. I'm so glad that we got them out from under that building. Poor little things would have died from worms! They were pulled out of some of the worst circumstances ever, but they are now safe. They would not have lived had we not got them from under the outbuilding and treated and cared for them.\" \n\nNow Lilly is a 8-9-month old puppy weighing about 22 pounds, a very pretty girl with beautiful white fur and black and brown markings. It takes Lilly some time to get used to new people. Through the first couple of months of her life, she had no interaction with humans, and she also was abandoned by her mother, so she did not have a positive start in life. Now she needs time to feel comfortable with her humans and to trust them. She is affectionate and friendly with her foster mom, a relationship that was built through several months. Thinking that she and her sister, Leah, would be more comfortable if adopted together, these two girls were placed in an adoptive home with each other, but Lilly, who is somewhat more friendly than Leah, seemed to become more fearful and the situation for both girls was not what we had expected. Lilly is very dog friendly though, and if she lived with a well-adjusted and friendly other dog, that could have a more positive impact on her. She is very sweet and gentle, just needs a home where she will be accepted and understood, a home filled with patience and kindness. Once her trust is won, the relationship with her humans will be intense and never ending.  \n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption fee required.

Contact generalinfo@furryfriendsnetwork.com for questions or if issues are encountered with the adoption application or general adoption process.\n\nFoster Homes are desperately needed in order to help more animals like this one. Please consider opening your heart and home to a homeless animal. To find out more about becoming a Foster Parent, see our website at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under VOLUNTEER tab.\n\nAs part of our adoption agreement, we require that you and your adopted canine attend a minimum of one group basic obedience course within 4 months of adoption. If adopting a puppy under 4 months old, we also require a group puppy socialization course be started immediately upon adoption.\n\nIn addition, we require that puppies under 6 months of age will not be alone for more than 4 hours at a time in an 8 hour workday. We highly encourage working families to consider older puppies and adult dogs, but if your heart is set on a puppy, please consider doggie daycare.\n\nPet ID:",

She is a beagle/border collie mix pup, quite intelligent, and she learns quickly. Leah is looking for a home with people who are willing to continue socializing and training her. She had no human touch through the first two months of her life, then her feral mother ran away and could not be found, so a tough beginning for Leah. She is nervous in new situations and needs time to adapt. She is fearful of men, more comfortable with women. She has spent time with children as visitors on a regular basis, but not 24 hours a day. She gets along with other dogs. She needs a special kind of home where her humans would have patience and a willingness to work with her as she adjusts. This will need time and cannot be rushed. She would probably benefit from having a friendly, outgoing dog as a companion. With time and love her gentle spirit will blossom. She has come to trust her foster mom and is comfortable and affectionate with her  Building a relationship with Leah will take time, but we feel that she will be a blessing to the human who wins her trust.\n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption fee required.

Cooper loves hiking and walking, playing with toys and attention!\n\nCooper is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio. The adoption fee is $150.00. An adoption application, home visit and adoption contract are all required. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations appropriate for their age, microchipped, and wormed for internal and external parasites. If you would like more information or an adoption application, please email us at sgdrsa@outlook.com.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification in rescue dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only GUESSING at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

They need to have the time to hand feed her to help her get on the right track.  She also needs a calm and quiet environment.\n\nAdditional info:\n \nThis 14 lb girl was very shy and scared at the shelter.  She is sweet, loves meeting new people and playing with toys. We're not sure what poor Glitter has experienced in her past but whatever it was, it  gave her some trust issues.  She is not one to be fussed over and will growl to let you know to give her space. She resource guards food and may snap if she feels crowded. She also has some separation anxiety and will bark when left alone and when in her crate, so she may not be good for apartment living. Due to her resource guarding and being a little sensitive she should not be in a home with kids. Glitter Girl needs to be with an experienced and/or confident person who will give her structure, boundaries and space while she learns to fully trust. Someone that is home often would also be best for her.\n\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

Could it be you?\n\nHere\u2019s my stats:\nPossible Breed:  Lhasa Apso\nGender:  Male\nColors:  Black and white\nAge:  4 years\n\nNow for the good stuff!-\n\nI am so ready for a forever home!  I get excited when my foster mom comes home and I want to get excited when my forever mom or dad come home!\n\nI'm a big guy but oh so gentle.  In every thing I do, I'm gentle.  I walk slowly, take treats where you almost don't know I've taken it, and I love to sleep all curled up.\n\nI may be blind but that doesn't stop me from getting around and exploring my environment.  I can go outside on my own and then find my way back in.  I find the water with no problems too.  I wasn't always blind so that has probably helped.  My nose really helps me especially when it comes to finding food.\n\nI'm a quiet kind of guy where you almost don't know I'm around.  I don't make a fuss about anything.  Well, if I'm behind a gate and I want to get out, I will be persistent and let you know in an quiet way but  you will know.  \n\nI'll make someone a wonderful friend.  Are you the one for me?\n\nPS. I've had ALL my vetting, and oh boy, it was a lot. Here's what I had done..\nDistemper/Parvo shots - TWICE (Foster Mom said we have to have two so that we are protected from these horrible viruses. One doesn't cut it.)\nBordetella shots - ALSO TWICE. \nSpay/Neuter, of course.\nA fecal exam so I don't have any bad worms.\nA heartworm test.\nBLOODWORK to make sure my liver and kidneys are working well, because you know, we doggies often have issues in the liver and kidneys.\nA DENTAL exam AND cleaning if I needed it- yep, all my toofies are checked so they can be in tip top shape\nSee, that's a LOT. Ask your vet - that's a LOT.\n\nYou can apply to adopt this adorable little fluff at www.shihtzu-rescue.com.  This adorable little fluff has been spayed or neutered, is up to date on all vaccinations and heartworm negative.",

Sam is also good with children, but we aren't sure if he likes cats. He loves having a companion to play with. Sam has had all of his shots.

In the words of one of his caregivers,\nColt\n\ndoesn't seem to let his inability to hear or see hinder him from carrying out a flawless routine daily. U\nsing his nose, he's able to walk to the door and down the ramp to the park with very little to no complications. What really amazes me is his ability to smell you from the opposite side of the park. As soon as his nose picks up your scent he's headed your way tail wagging ready to play. Watching\n\nColt\n\non his journey to the park you see him rely on his sense of touch. As soon as his paws land on the concrete at the bottom of the ramp he immediately takes a right knowing the vast open park awaits him. Surely\n\nColts\n\nability to use his sense of touch will touch your heart and aid you in deciding whether or not to adopt a rescue. It's a gift that will never stop giving.\n\nContact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

At Straydog, we soon discovered that Joe was deaf. When he's sleeping, he doesn't wake up if you call his name, clap, or make loud noises. You have to touch him. Joe is a very sweet dog. He loves playing with his kennel mate. Joe likes most dogs and he would do well with children. Joe would make a great family pet for any family because does not know that he is any different from any other dog. He would love to be a part of a forever family.\nContact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

They are known as pocket pitties because of their diminutive size weighing about 35 pounds each. They are both sweet and fun dogs, with a great energy about them. When they get excited they wag their whole bodies, not just their tails. They bring you joy just to watch them. Because they must be adopted together, only one adoption fee is required for both dogs. If you would like to give these \"itty bitty pitty sisters\" their forever home, please contact us today.\nContact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

Chestnut is acclimating slowly to the noises of the city--he is still quite fearful of loud noises and sudden movements. He would do best in a quiet suburban home with a fenced yard in which he can run and play to his heart's content. \n\nChestnut is not a fan of other animals, so he would be like to be the only pet. He is also quite shy, so he will benefit from patient experienced adult owners who will provide him time to adjust to his new environment and help him come out of his shell. Interested in meeting his handsome boy?\n\nStop by our Pippen Fasseas Adoption Center at 1997 North Clybourn Ave., in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood today!",

YES\nGood w/dogs?: YES\nGood w/children: YES, older kids would be best\nPersonality: Akira is a one and half year old husky/shepherd mix girl that is good with small dogs and cats. She needs someone with time and patience to help her understand that people just want to love her.\nHer adopter must be very local as it will take multiple visits and time for her to get comfortable before an official adoption can happen. She must have at least one other dog to play with as she is very dog social and comfortable. A six foot privacy fence is a must with her. She needs a person that understands she just prefers to not be pet. She will play/juke/talk/hike with someone, but cuddling is just not her thing. Akira doesn't have an ounce of aggression in her as she is more the flight in fright risk. She is such a unique and beautiful girl with great personality just in her own way.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nHEALTH: All Husky Pack Rescue dogs are current on vaccines, dewormed, microchipped, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption.\nAPPLICATION PROCESS:\n\nComplete Adoption Application at http://www.huskypackrescue.com/adoption-application\n\nWhat we are looking for on the application:\n\nAll pets must be spayed or neutered\n\nAll dogs must be on Heartworm preventative\n\nAbility to exercise your Husky daily\n\nAdoptions can NOT be given as gifts\n\nDemonstrated willingness to take care of your new dog for its lifetime\n\nAbility to pay our adoption fee - cash, check, money order or PayPal\n\nVeterinarian reference is highly preferred\n\nWe will review your application and respond within 7 days.\nIf your application is approved we will set up a time for you to meet your chosen dog.\nEven though your adoption application may specify a particular dog, the result of a successful application only means you are approved to adopt through HPR, not that you are approved to adopt that particular dog.\nIf the potential adopter causes a delay in the adoption after they are approved, we CAN NOT guarantee the dog you are interested will still be available when you are ready, especially if there are other applicants interested in the same dog.\nWe do not adopt on a first come, first serve basis; we choose the best application to match the needs of each of our dogs.\nWe do not have a shelter facility nor do we have any set open/closed hours. We are a foster based program with all our dogs living with a foster family.\nA home visit is required prior to every adoption.\n\nCONTACTS:\nGeneral Questions,Comments, Donations: info.huskypackrescue@gmail.com\nInterested in Fostering or Volunteering: info.huskypackrescue@gmail.com\n12/9/20 3:33 PM",

Neutered and housebroken.\nWhat BLU needs from his people:\nBlu needs a strong experienced person as his owner and one that will continue with his training.. He is a powerful dog.\nIn training, Blu was very quick to learn and did very well once he knew what was expected of him. Blu had a bit of *leash frustration* when he went to Starmark Academy, but once taught to *HEEL* his frustration toward other dogs went away. He was taught what his job was, and it was to *HEEL* His training needs to be reinforced by his people.\nAt this time we feel BLU would work better as an only dog in the home. No cats please.\nIf you would like to meet BLU, please send us an email at:\nangels2therescuear@gmail.com",

Please email fortleavenworthstrayfacility@gmail.com for an adoption application and/or call MSPR for more information: (816) 858-7387.\n\nBelini (aka Bella) is estimated to be about 6 or so years old. She was adopted from another organization about a year before she was relinquished to us, which was about a year ago. (That organization guessed her to be 3-4 years old at the time.) Her former family brought her in to us just before the holidays in 2019 to help her find a better match.\n\nBella is a sweet dog, a very friendly girl. She does her chores quickly when let out, is happy to run around the yard awhile and then kennels up beautifully. Seems to be pretty happy to please if you have a treat. She seems a little deaf if you don't have a treat, ha!\n\nShe does pull on the leash and weighs about 80 pounds, so she'll need someone who can handle her and can give her regular exercise.\n\nShe went for a trial adoption visit to a home that had a dog and cats. She was wonderful WONDERFUL with the humans, children included, but did not do well with the resident dog and cats. Thus, she might do best in a home as the only pet or with another dog she \"chooses.\"\n\nCall 913-684-4939 or email fortleavenworthstrayfacility@gmail.com.\n\nFeatured as the Pet of the Week in the Jan. 2, 2020, issue, as well as the April 30, 2020, online issue, of the Fort Leavenworth Lamp.\n\nBella has been waiting patiently for the right family to find her, but it has been A YEAR (yes, a full year!) since she came into our care and she really should be in a home instead of in limbo!\n\nFeatured as the Pet of the Week in the Jan. 2, 2020; April 30, 2020; and Jan. 21, 2021, issues of the Fort Leavenworth Lamp.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:\nPlease email us for an adoption application form or drop by the facility to fill one out.

            "description": "Meet Athena! This senior girl has quite the story. \n\nThis sweet angel was picked up as a lost dog in mid-October 2019. She was adopted from us shortly after that, but was then picked stray again November 2019. She was never redeemed. She was heartworm positive and we wanted to get her treated, so she went into foster care in February 2020. What should have been a 3 month stay in foster care has turned into 8 months because we found out almost as soon as she went into the foster home that she is a seizure patient. \n\nShe is some type of hound mix , so she lives by her nose. She walks very well on a leash but walks tend to be slow because she is constantly looking for food (earthworms and bugs are her favorites).  Athena is also known to resource guard not only food, but also the couch. She will snarl if you touch her while she is on the couch. She thrives on the attention she gets from her favorite humans. Athena is funny \u2026 she is so clumsy and bouncy as she jumps around the kitchen for food (because true to her breed, it is all she thinks about). Athena \u201cmothers\u201d her foster parents\u2019 dogs \u2026 she just loves to be near them.\n\nSmall children are not recommended because of the resource guarding and she just doesn't know her size. Athena loves people. She is guesstimated to be almost 8 years old. She has finished her heartworm treatment and is due for her heartworm test to confirm she is negative in December 2020. Athena does suffer from seizures but with her three times a day medication, her seizures have decreased in frequency. If medicating as directed, the frequency has dropped to about 1 seizure every 2 months. The medication costs approximately $30.00 per month. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what she went through in her life, but we do not think car rides were a pleasant experience for her. Athena is scared to get in any vehicle \u2026 even treats don't always help. Adopter needs to be able to lift her 50 lbs. body in case she protests getting in. \n",

Klaus ended up at the shelter after his family was evicted and they left him behind in their home. He was adopted out twice from the shelter and returned for being snappy before he came to our rescue.  In his foster home, Klaus is a happy and lively little guy. He is good with the other dogs in his foster home, both big and small.  He loves to play!  Klaus is not great with cats \u2013 he likes to chase them.  Klaus takes quite a while to warm up to new people and will be snappy if pushed.  He strongly prefers women to men.  The best home for him would be one that is fairly quiet, with no small children, and maybe with another friendly dog he can play with. Klaus is housebroken, but he does mark in the house when he is stressed, and he is crate trained.  Klaus has the potential to be a very loving and loyal companion for the right person.",

            "description": "Emmett was found outside a rural home in SE Missouri on December 8, 2018. He was bloody, bony, and shivering with cold and pain, yet he was calm and gentle as I got him into my car and took him home. Emmett is now about 5-7 years old, 70 pounds, neutered, UTD on vax, dewormed, and microchipped. He tested a \u201cstrong\u201d positive for heartworms on 1/2/19 and was still a \u201cweak\u201d positive on 10/1/19 after months of slow kill treatment with doxycycline and Advantage Multi.\n\nEmmett loves every person he meets! He\u2019s very strong and plays rough, so he probably shouldn\u2019t be in a home with small children. He doesn\u2019t get along with most dogs and chases cats, so Emmett definitely needs to be the only companion animal in the home. Emmett has unrestricted access to a fenced yard and always uses the doggy door to potty outside. He doesn\u2019t climb fences or dig holes. He\u2019s crate trained and walks well on a leash. Emmett knows to sit before he gets fed and before exiting the door for walks. He makes the silliest grunting and whining sounds to get my attention. He has a moderate energy level and plays with his toys by tossing them in the air and then pouncing on them. Emmett has a lot of love to give and really needs a home of his own.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n* 6 years old\n* Only been in a crate to travel\n* Uses doggy door\n* Very, very dog selective. Need to be only dog.\n",

Goosie is looking for a calm, stable home where she can settle into a routine, and enjoy her golden years with someone who is home all or most of the time, and with special needs dog experience with ability to make her their priority. She should be the only dog in the home as she guards her food an may lash out at other dogs but she very much enjoys the company of cats. She is house trained but may have accidents due to her age and medications.  Her age-related health challenges have improved through prescription diet, supplements and medications (arthritis, early stage renal disease, liver imbalance, tooth tartar, heart murmur) - she remains a feisty girl despite deafness, blindness in the left and partial sight in the right eye. She enjoys short 10-20 minute walks but due to limited mobility needs to be carried for curbs, stairs and uneven terrain as she may stumble and fall. She loves cuddling and napping with her people when it suits her, playing with her toys, and her treats! Riding in a crate or carrier in the car is best and helps to calm her during short drives (which she finds stressful).  If you think you could be a great fit for Goosie, please e-mail us for more information! therealbark@gmail.com\n",

She would thrive with a fun active but low stress lifestyle with someone who works from home and has time to give her. Harlee also loves a nice comfortable couch and cuddling with her human as well as her daily walks for mental and physical exercise. She has received professional leash and obedience training however she does not do well with other dogs so needs to be an only child.  An experienced adopter(s) who knows how to set boundaries would be ideal. A house with a fenced yard is a  must. Currently Harlee is being fostered in Acton, CA.  Schedule an appointment to meet this fabulous girl. She will steal your heart!",

            "description": "Billy! \nSweet Sweet Billy... this fella is as gentle and calm and quiet as they come. He is shy and takes time to warm up but the reward is definitely worth the wait! Billy came to Save A Pet from animal control in Macon. He was the very last dog to leave before a temporary closing and was set to be euthanized if we did not save him. We knew IMMEDIATELY that Billy was so worth saving. He was so sweet but very guarded. It took awhile for his personality to show. Billy is quiet and extremely observant. We often catch him \"\"peeking\"\" in from the outside of his kennel watching us work. He will come to the front of his kennel and watch everything going on. He prefers to have his bowl outside with him and you can hear him pick it up to eat outside! He is funny to watch!\nBilly enjoys the company of other dogs and would probably do best with a confident companion. He sure does love his Sadie May! She is his best friend and they play together every day. Sadie has really helped Billy come out of his shell!\nBilly is 3.5 years old and weighs about 60 pounds. He is very handsome and is such a good boy!!",

He is under supervision of our vets and behavioral staff, but we would be happy to explain his needs further to potential adopters. He has in the past been great with other dogs, kids and has previously lived with rabbits! He also loves to eat apples and bananas. He also loves to sunbathe outside. He is house-broken and crate-trained and knows Sit and Paw. Since Blaze's estimated birthdate is 04/22/2015, his adoption fee is $275. If you want to know more about him and to speak to an Adoption Counselor, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt. (If the dog you're interested in meeting is living in a foster home, the Adoption Counselor will make an appointment for you to meet the dog at the shelter.)

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!12/30/2019 Ranch evaluation.

Today for the first time we saw him actually playing with one of the younger dogs which was very cool to see :)Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

            "description": "For up-to-date info like events, closings, new animals, success stories please LIKE Manchester Animal Shelter on Facebook!\n\nMiss Fiona is finally available for adoption! This beautiful girl is a 46 pound, 6-year-old, pocket pit looking for her forever home. She came to us as a stray in the worst shape. Skinny, malnourished, and mangey, and that was only the beginning. We believe she was dumped in Manchester and was probably fending for herself for quite some time. This petite gal is nothing short of a warrior, a fighter, a survivor!\n\nOnce she was in our care, Fiona started her road to recovery. It took over a year until she was finally healthy and strong. Finding the right diet and medications &learning to trust people again. Now she goes on outings where she ventures to public places and continues to amaze us with the progress, she makes each time! She was so stubborn at first when we initially started training, and now she thoroughly enjoys it. She is highly intelligent, and she knows it! Her circle of friends continues to grow, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder!\n\nFiona loves to be out in the yard. She sunbathes and rolls around on her back, legs flailing in the air, just soaking up her happy place. She will stalk birds and squirrels and enjoys sounding the alarm, so everyone knows there is a person at the door. Fiona also does well in the car. Whatever gets her out of the shelter is good enough for her! She is recently being fostered with one of her favorite volunteers. We receive an outstanding report every time we check-in. She does well in a home, no accidents, and doesn\u2019t seem too upset being there alone. She makes herself at home, slinking up on the couch and watching soap operas while her foster dad is at work. That\u2019s the life according to Miss Fi!\n\nIntroductions with this beauty will need to go slow to ensure a smooth transition. Once she warms up and knows she can trust you, you are a friend for life. It\u2019s an honor to be her friend. The way she was treated by previous humans, could have left her aggressive and lost. That\u2019s the power of a pit bull though. They are such exquisite creatures and we should all take a page out of their book. \n\nFiona needs to be the only pet in the home. No young kids in the home either. It may be possible for her to live with older, mature, teenagers. Otherwise, Fiona is content being your one and only!\n\nSo, what do you think? Are you ready to meet Fiona? Please contact canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org to start the ball rolling!\n\n\nAdoption fee is based on age:\nPuppies 8 weeks to 7 months are $400\nDogs 8 months to 7 years are $325\nSenior dogs over 8 years are $125\nSenior for Seniors (Seniors 65+ adopting over 7 years): $75\n\nAll adoptable dogs are spayed and neutered, have age and time appropriate vaccines, microchipped and heartworm tested. Other medical care provided might include treatments for fleas, ear mites, dental work or infections or other medical conditions. Additional vaccinations and medical care (including puppies Rabies shots if adopted at under 12 weeks of age) will be the responsibility of the adopter.\n\nIf you have questions you can call our office at 603.628.3544. To complete out an adoption application come to 490 Dunbarton Rd in Manchester, NH, during the shelters open hours. \nWe do not do same day adoptions \n\nAdoption hours: \nSaturday: 10-4\nSunday: 12-3\nMonday and Friday: 12-4\nTuesday and Thursday: 12-7pm\nClosed on Wednesday\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: As with all of our dogs, we strongly recommend obedience classes for new owner and dog to create a life-long bond with the adopted dog based on trust, respect, and rewarding training experiences. Our shelter dogs are strays and we observe and assess their behavior at the shelter which may be somewhat different in a home environment.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!My name is Sadie. I lived with my mommy forever and then her landlord said 'get rid of the dogs' :( Next thing I knew I was scooped up by her son along with my friend who was much younger than me and taken to a very noisy place. Her son seemed really sad for us. I understood why after he left because we got stuck in little cage and that was the last I ever saw my friend :(A nice lady came in that knew I wasn't in a good space and she made a call to 2nd Chance and now I'm a northerner and I have a really nice foster mom & dad :)I have some hip issues but hey at 14 what can you expect!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

She\u2019s shown great aptitude for jumping, so if you\u2019ve ever wanted a dog to take through agility training, Pepper is your girl!  \n\nWe don\u2019t know Pepper\u2019s full history, but we suspect that life hasn\u2019t always been great to her. She is so full of love and adores to be around her humans, but she also has some anxiety in new situations.  Her doggy foster siblings help with that, but Pepper will need a patient owner who respects her boundaries and will help Pepper continue to gain confidence and be her best doggy self!",

            "description": "Olivia has been looking for a forever home for over a year now! Her estimated DOB is 4/2014. She is gentle, calm, loves to cuddle, and enjoys car rides. She will bond strongly to her family and would love to go everywhere with them. While she is calm and gentle, she is a large dog, weighing 106 pounds and can be stubborn so she needs a strong guiding hand. Olivia likes some dogs (prefers easy going males), but would be fantastic as an only dog. She should not be with cats or small dogs. This girl is uncomfortable around small children, so an adult only home or a home with older children (13 years+) is a must. Olivia is housebroken. She does need to be on a special diet for her urinary health. She does fantastic on this food and it keeps her urinary tract healthy and free of crystals. Since she does have to be kept on this prescription food, FOPAS is offering a permanent foster situation for Olivia. You provide a safe, loving home and FOPAS provides food and medical care for Olivia. \n\nIf you are interested in Olivia, fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

            "description": "Meet Dixie Doodlebug!  Dixie is a Hound mix about 1 1/2 years old.  She came into our rescue in December 2018 and was pregnant.  She had 8 puppies on January 4, 2019.  she has since been spayed and is current on her shots.  Dixie still acts very much like a puppy herself.  She has a lot of energy and loves to run in her fenced yard.  She just loves attention and can be very affectionate.  Dixie is fine with women but picks the men she likes.  She does not care for young, active children.  The best home for Dixie would be one as an ONLY pet, a quiet home with a fenced yard.  She will need someone with dog experience that will work with her on her insecurities.  Dixie is just so happy to see people that she trusts.  We are hoping someone will give her the home that she deserves.\n\nIf you are interested in Dixie, please contact Best Buddy Pet Rescue at (248) 622-6097 or complete our online application at:  bestbuddypetrescue.com",

He would do best at a home with other dogs and where people are not gone all day. \n\nKellen Rescue typically require fenced yards and do not adopt out of State with the exception of sometimes to neighboring States.

She needs to be an only dog but she is amazing with people. She loves to play but has no idea she is so strong so she would be better with older kids.  She has a sparkling personality and just wants her own person to love!  She spent her first few years on the streets with her family, often living in a tent.  If you have ever been around a dog who has lived with a homeless person they are generally very affectionate, responsive and well behaved, they learn to be attentive to their owner's needs because they are normally together 24/7.  Her mom loved her very much but realized when Cena got pregnant that she and her puppies needed more than she was able to give.",

            "description": "Hi all!!! It\u2019s Bubbles again. My forever humans still haven\u2019t found me and I really need your help to find them. I am a grown up dog at 5 years old so that means I know where to do my business and I already trained the humans how to give me treats for good boy behavior. I stay off counters and furniture (although sometimes I like to borrow the fluffy blanket off the couch). I am kennel trained and I get along with doggies of all sizes. Also I get along really well with all humans (including the shrunken kind). I am laid back, mild mannered, and low energy. Unfortunately no dog is perfect. I am not very good with the scratchy creatures my foster mom refers to as \u201ccats\u201d but I can behave around a barn scratchy. Also I have this condition called ADOST (attention deficit oh squeaky toy). This means my forever humans need to have an abundance of squeaky toys available at all times. Despite this crazy condition, I am a very good boy who knows how to take care of my squeaky toys so they don\u2019t spontaneously explode. Although sometimes my toys get to talking to much and lose their voice. Other than that I am as close to perfect as perfect gets. I know not everyone can adopt right now so if you don\u2019t mind sharing me out, I\u2019ll make sure to pay it forward by being an excellent advocate for my breed.\nThanks for reading and I can\u2019t wait to meet my forever family!",

            "description": "Oh Bell...we love you but what a Unique girl you are. Bell was transferred to us from another shelter with a friend when they were out of space and out of time. Her friend has been adopted, but Bell is left behind. Bell doesn't necessarily get along with a large number of dogs; we've had her matched up a couple times and it takes just the right mix. Her biggest issue is that she's very reactive to other dogs through the fence. She's a beautiful girl and a very sweet soul and she's amazing with people and she definitely deserves a chance. We are recommending that Bell find a home where she will be an only dog. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhen introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630. You can email us at doitorthepets@gmail.com.",

This meant that they let me have my own space for a few days to decompress and only my foster mom came in and out so I didn\u2019t get too overwhelmed, and because sometimes men freak me out.  A few days later I met my foster dad and I actually really liked him, too!  When new people come around my foster mom tells them to allow me to come to them on my own time rather than approach me because sometimes it makes me feel scared.  I tend to attach to one person who makes me feel confident.  I need someone who is patient and will allow me to open up on my own terms because I promise if I can move slow with introductions and adjusting I am such a sweet girl that gives cute big smiles!\u00a0 \n\nThere are other dogs in the house, but I do not like them at all.  My foster parents keep us separate.  Other dogs are a hard no for me.  I want 100% of the attention from my future family!\n\nI am medium energy, about 60 lbs, crate trained (I like to sleep at night in there), love snuggling on the couch, enjoy belly and butt scratches, drool at the thought of a bone slathered with peanut butter inside, am pretty darn good at fetch, and know how to sit like a good girl.\u00a0 I am okay with cats and haven\u2019t been tested with kids yet.\u00a0\n\nMy foster mom says I act like some other animal called a deer because of the way I leap around the backyard.  Oh how I\u2019d love if my future family had a big fenced in backyard for me to run around in\u2014 I love to run and leap, but not for too long because I\u2019d much prefer to be laying on my back like a baby in the lap of someone who loves me.\n\nBecause I get nervous with new people initially, continual support will be needed post adoption, therefore, upon locating my right family, IBR would like to financially support training classes for me and my new family to ensure I\u2019m set up for a long successful life.\u00a0 I have already been attending some classes to work on my manners.  \n\nIf you think you can give me a no-dog, patient, energetic, loving home please consider putting in an app for me!  I dream of a person of my own one day!\n",

Check their hours online: https://www.manchesteranimalshelter.org/\n\nFiona is a very sweet 6-year old, 46-pound pocket pittie located near Manchester, NH. She\u2019s spayed, house-trained, and up-to-date on vaccines. She has been in a loving foster home during the pandemic which has enabled her to grow into herself after a very long shelter stay. She will need a special adopter to help her continue this journey of discovery.\n\nFiona really enjoys being with people, going on low-key outings, playing, taking walks, and cuddling. Once she knows people, she will wag her tail and give a snuggle. This is amazing considering her background. Fiona was in poor shape when picked up as a stray in 2019. Malnourished and mangey, you would never know she is the same dog today. This petite gal is a survivor who started her road to recovery once under the care of our friends at the Manchester Animal Shelter. \nIt took over a year until she was finally healthy and strong. Finding the right diet and medications, and learning to trust people again. Now she goes on outings where she ventures to public places and continues to amaze us with the progress, she makes each time! She was so stubborn at first when we initially started training, and now she thoroughly enjoys it. She is highly intelligent, and she knows it! \nFiona loves to be out in the yard. She sunbathes and rolls around on her back, legs flailing in the air, just soaking up her happy place. She will stalk birds and squirrels and enjoys sounding the alarm, so everyone knows there is a person at the door. Fiona also does well in the car. Whatever gets her out of the shelter is good enough for her! She receives an outstanding report every time the foster checks in. She does well in a home, has no accidents, and doesn\u2019t seem too upset being there alone. She just settles into a comfy spot, watches Animal Planet, and waits for the foster dad to return home. She\u2019s loves the simple things in life!  \n\nIntroductions with this beauty will need to go slow to ensure a smooth transition. way she was treated by previous humans, could have left her aggressive and lost, but the inner power of a pit bull shines through instead. Fiona needs to be the only fur-kid in an adult-only home. No kids or busy apartment complexes please. It may be possible for her to live with older, mature teenagers, so please email your situation to the address below if that is the case. \n\nTo apply for the prize pittie, contact canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org and tell them ARK sent you!\n\n\n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST ~ PLZ DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~\nIf you are interested in this dog,  Please apply in person during adoption hours at the Manchester Animal Shelter in Manchester, NH.

In fact, he shares a kennel with his best friend. However, around people Rufus wants all the attention for himself and tries to push other dogs away. Depending on the personality of the other dogs, that may or may not be an issue. \n\nHe may technically be a senior but aside from a few flecks of grey starting to show in his muzzle you would never know it. He's ready to play or go for a walk the second you pick up the leash. If you're looking for a well-mannered dog who's outgrown the puppy energy, Rufus is your man!",

            "description": "She is a young two year old, highly athletic, beautiful tri-color bully blend who entered our facility a little over 9 months ago. Zaylee came to us after enduring highly unstable circumstances. Living a transient lifestyle where she was frequently left alone in the woods, tied to various objects when her owners were not around. Understandably, she does not respond well to strangers who approach her kennel and is uneasy around new situations and people she doesn't know. It is important her new family understands this uneasiness, to avoid putting her at risk for a misunderstanding. Zaylee takes her time getting to know you before giving you her immense love and devotion. Given a little patience, respect and kindness she really comes out of her shell and illuminates a heart that is made of pure gold. Zaylee is young with puppy like energy. She loves to be silly, run zoomies, splash in the water, play fetch and search for those pesky gophers. While she loves to run and play she also enjoys chilling out with her favorite humans on the sofa and unwinding with some her favorite toys. Zaylee has responded very well to harness training and is our preferred method of working with her. She knows how to sit and stay and would love to continue working on her training with you. A home with adults or older teens is preferred. This bubbly little lady will flourish with experienced owners who can give her time, patience, love and structure. Zaylee can become reactive to other dogs and small animals. She would really shine and thrive as the only pet in the home. UTD on all shots, vaccines, spayed and in great health. She really struggles with the stress and boredom of kennel life and is ready to be rescued!  Please contact Del Norte Animal Control (707) 464-7235 if you are interested in meeting Zaylee!\n\n Come check out our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nWe pre-screen adopters interested in the Pit Bull Terrier blends at Del Norte Animal Control, and an adoption application will be required from those interested in providing a fab furever home to Zaylee.  Please call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

            "description": "Millie Mae is a bouncy, happy, active young adult.  She absolutely loves\npeople, and will soak up pets, belly rubs, and snuggles. She still jumps\nfor joy when greeting people - as a tall and lanky 75# dog, her\nenthusiasm can be a hazard to children and seniors. A large overbite\ngives her a giant beaming smile.  When not basking in attention or\nsleeping, she trots around exploring or entertains herself playing.\nMillie is a country girl, having spent most of her life outdoors in a\nfenced yard or chicken run.  She was not potty trained as a puppy, but\nhas not had any accidents in the small portion of our house we have\nallowed her into.  We think she can learn house manners with patience\nand training - and know she would be delighted to spend more time with\npeople.  Her first family had fowl, doves and rabbits.  We believe Millie is safe with poultry and has expressed only curiosity about our neighbor's cows and horses.  She is not a livestock guardian, but her big, deep bark alerts to approaching cars and people.\nWe have started teaching Millie basic commands, and she is a fast\nlearner.  She has walked our\nproperty well on a long retractable leash, and has been manageable on a\nshort leash during trips to town.\n\nPlease visit www.txpyrs.org for more information and to fill out an application.\n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees. We have the best selection of Pyrs in Texas and we do home checks and vet checks before placement. We start with adoption applications (no cost/obligation) and we make placements on a first submitted-first approved basis. If you are interested in giving this dog a new home, please complete an adoption form found at http://www.txpyrs.org",

The elderly woman was terrified of dogs and her rural county does not have an Animal Control. The police would not approach Eggy as they said he was being fearful. Luckily, our friends at nearby Macon-Bibb Animal Control sprang into action to secure the dog and Jason drove 3 hours, late in the evening on December 10th, 2019 to pick him up. Eggy is a special boy and he was lovingly named in honor of our founder, Jason's, late brother who passed away 15 years ago. Eggy was his brother's childhood nickname and his birthday is on December 18th, just a few days away from Eggy's freedom ride.\nABOUT EGGY\nIt was very apparent from his condition that some extremely bad things have happened to Eggy. He clearly suffered tremendously and we are grateful to be the positive start to his journey. Dear, sweet Eggy is Forlorn no more and will know nothing but love from here on out. Eggy was evaluated by our vet and has a long list of ailments. His condition was so critical, he had to undergo surgery to clean and repair multiple lacerations and have part of his tail amputated as it was down to the bone. Luckily, his bloodwork came back good. There were remnants of a buck-shot and bone fragments on his x-rays consistent with a gunshot wound to the face. He was loaded with intestinal parasites, fleas, and ticks. Along with the wounds all over his body, Eggy had pressure sores down to the bone. He was so thin and malnourished that his body condition score was a 1 out of 9. Poor Eggy suffered far too long from neglect and abuse, but to top it all off, Eggy had an advanced case of heartworms that have since been treated. His healing journey is one for the record books, but despite his condition, Eggy is strong, sweet, and wagging his tail (or shall we call it a nub!). Eggy loves his shenanigans and his favorite game is 'keep-away,' where he will merrily zoom around the yard with his Kong in his mouth, leaving the Palace workers to chase after him when it's time to come inside. He is looking for a forever family where he can keep on enjoying the good life of a beloved house pet. Eggy has been through more than we can imagine and he is not suited for a home with other pets or small children. If you think you can give Eggy the life he so desperately wants and deserves, contact us for more information!\nPhoto Album of Eggy: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=3115449728513172\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "Bishop is one of our dogs who needed a \"little extra\" in terms of training to get him ready for a wonderful forever home.\n\nHe came into the rescue from an animal advocate who had rescued him from a bad situation but was unable to keep him. We saw Bishop posted on a free pets site and reached out to her. After meeting him, we agreed to bring him into the rescue.\n\nWe thought we had a foster in place for Bishop. However plans sometime don't materialize. When the foster placement fell through, Bishop spent much longer than was ideal in boarding at our vet's office. He is a young, active, high-energy dog, and time in the boarding kennel took its toll on him.\n\nThankfully, a good friend of our rescue agreed to take Bishop into her home and has done some foster-based training with him. \n\nBishop has excelled in his training! It took him a couple of weeks to relax and decompress and, once that happened, he proved himself to be a happy student.\n\nBishop is now able to stay on all four feet when excited.  He sits nicely and patiently waiting for his meals. He walks well on a leash. He has learned that there are more appropriate ways to seek attention than using his mouth. He knows his basic commands. In short, Bishop is now ready to move to a wonderful forever home!\n\nWe would like to see Bishop in a home with a family experienced with the breed.\n\nHe will do best as an only pet, and in an adult home or one with children 16 years old or older.\n\nWe'd love to see Bishop in a home with a fenced yard where he can run and play. He also needs a family who will take him out and about, and continue to introduce him to new people, places, and things.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Bishop, please fill out the application at our website: https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application\n\nADOPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:\n\nOur goal is to help you find a wonderful new family member! We work closely with you to ensure that the dog you adopt will be a wonderful match for your family's make-up and lifestyle. Our adoption and foster placement processes includes an application, personal and vet reference checks, a home visit, and a meet and greet with the dog and all family members and other pets.\n\nPlacement is considered on the basis of the best interests of the dog and the best fit with the family - we do not adopt on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\nWe do not transport our dogs outside of the state of CT. If you live outside of CT and are able to travel to us after an application is approved, with your family and other pets, for a meet and greet and to complete the adoption in CT if that goes well, you're welcome to apply to adopt one of our dogs, as long as you live in one of the New England states. We do not adopt our dogs long-distance, or outside of the New England area.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  All of our dogs live in foster homes within the state of CT.  We do not have a facility.  For that reason we ask that you go through the application/approval process prior to a meet and greet, which is always part of our placement protocol.  We do this because we try to keep our foster families' day to day lives s uninterrupted as possible. You can fill out an adoption application at our website, at https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application .",

Other dogs (with proper introduction) should be big like me. I have the most expressive eyes, accented with manly outlines of black hair, do well on a leash, and know quite a few basic commands, including \"sit\", \"stay\", \"wait\", \"release\", \"down\", \"stack\", and \"look at me\". Do you think you could learn these commands, too? Also, I would love a home with fenced yard to keep me safe, no cats, and a grain-free diet to keep me healthy.\n\nFrom Foster Family: \nThings we\u2019ve learned about Milo since we\u2019ve had him:\n\u2022\tHe likes walks on the beach, and playing in the waves.  He also enjoys chasing rivers, but he is ambivalent about lakes and ponds. \n\u2022\tHe loves walks in the woods - his nose is always working.  This can make for very slow going if it\u2019s a trail where a lot of other dogs have been or very fast going if he happens upon a snake or rabbit to chase (reminder:  he is VERY strong!). \n\u2022\tHe is always excited for a car ride, but does not always appreciate strangers (like baristas or cashiers) talking to you.  But, yes, he would like a puppucino, thanks for asking. \n\u2022\tHe is VERY food motivated.  Except lettuce, he doesn\u2019t like that - but it is worth giving it to him to watch him spit it out.  Also keep in mind that he is counter height (He seems to have learned not to get up there anymore, but I still wouldn\u2019t leave out any temptations.)  \n\u2022\tHe gets VERY excited when his people come home.  He likes to greet you at the door with a gift.  He used to pick shoes, but he\u2019s learned to get one of his own toys now. It\u2019s super sweet and cute.\n\u2022\tHe likes to look at the window, deer are his favorite.  Also a good time to remember that he is stronger than the screen if there is a cat, rabbit, or deer outside.\n\u2022\tHe is a big fan of comfort - apparently only peasants chew their bones on the floor.  A dog of his caliber requires a nice couch, bean bag or dog bed.  It may or may not matter to him if you are already sitting there.\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t believe ANY stuffed animal that tries to make you think it\u2019s a match for him.  It\u2019s not.  \n\u2022\tHe does not appreciate it if you stop rubbing his belly and is not shy in letting you know about it. \n\u2022\tSimilarly, he does not like to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.  He usually will, but sometimes if he is very excited or in a surly mood - watch your fingers.\n\u2022\tImpulse control is not always his jam.  But he really does want to be good.  \n\u2022\tHe\u2019s very protective.  Besides the baristas, he\u2019s also saved us from the UPS guy, and the noisy furnace.  I also feel safe with him on trails.\n\nThe best way I can think of to describe Milo is that he\u2019s like having a very large, strong, opinionated four year old.  Meaning, he is super adorable and very fun, but a lot of work.  And worth it.  \n\nIf you have further questions or would like to schedule an appointment to meet me in person, please contact the adoption team at Shelton Adopt-a-Pet. Emails are the preferred method of communication.\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\nEmail: thedoghouse3091@hotmail.com\nTelephone: (360) 432-3091\nApplication: https://form.jotform.com/40419164974157\n",

If she is a match, we will respond within 48 hrs.  \nMaggie is a little female long haired chihuahua/doxie maybe spaniel mix who was dropped off at the shelter because her family did not want the responsibility of taking care of her.   She is 9 yrs old and around 8 lbs she does not take up much room at all.  Maggie is slow to trust however if you take time to get to know her she is sweet, loves being a lap dog and getting belly rubs and asks to be picked up and carried.  She is very loyal and bonds quickly and follows her person around the house all the time.  She loves attention and treats but she is is food/treat possessive and resource guards so a very experience home with no dominant dogs would be best.   Maggie is also fear aggressive at times, when she knows she is in trouble or when you reach for her too quickly she will bite, so her owner has to be careful and familiar with fearful dogs and be ready for continuous training.   We know she can be amazing in the right home as she has come such a long way in terms of trust, but she needs that dedicated adopter to help her stay on track.  No children for this pup.  While she is housetrained she does act out at times with inappropriate urination, so again lots of stability would be best for her.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption. \nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nRe-Listed for adoption: 12/7/2020\nAdoption fee: $250\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

            "description": "Olivia is in love with all people she meets!  She wants to be around humans wherever they go and snuggling with her people is one of her absolute favorite activities.  Olivia's foster family reports she is really a sweetheart and always enjoys her people's full one on one attention. While Olivia loves attention, she will still require a home with a family who can provide firm, consistent rules, boundaries, leadership and a very consistent routine for her.  She is a \u201cresource guarder\u201d of all types (food, water, human interaction, toys) and she is definitely has the \u201cbully\u201d personality.  Her adoptive family must always remind her of her place in the home and that she comes \"2nd\".  Again, she must have a very firm, consistent owner who will set a firm routine with clear rules and boundaries for her in her adoptive home.  She would also do best if there were no other dogs in the household in her adoptive home.  She is insecure around other dogs and this manifests into dog aggression, especially when energy levels are higher (during play times or any excitement in the home), so a home with no other dogs will absolutely be required for her. Her foster family continues to work with her to correct unwanted behaviors as needed as, again, she does tend to resource guard things like human attention and toys and does not hesitate to try and start a fight with another dog over something she wants or considers hers. She has met children as young as 1 year old and has done well with them, but she does not really have the energy for young, rambunctious/active children.  Due to this, a home with older, easy going, respectful, dog savvy children 12 years or older will be preferred for her.  Again, she wouldn\u2019t mind older children being around/visiting from time to time, but they\u2019d need to be dog savvy and respectful and be able to understand her needs - treating her VERY gently and not treating her as a roughhouse playmate. As with all dogs, Olivia should always be supervised around children to ensure that both she and they are kept safe.  Olivia seems to be a typical loafer Frenchie, but does still like to play for short brisk periods of time. She has very short bursts of energy to bark at a dog on other side of fence or play with a toy in the house for a few times.  \n\nOlivia has been working on potty training with her foster family but still needs time to improve her skills in this area. Due to her medication's side effects (increased thirst and urination) it complicates her potty training and inability to hold her bladder. It does help to have her on a very consistent potty break schedule and having frequent potty breaks helps her eliminate accidents - at *least* every 3-4 hours is best for helping avoid accidents. She may never be considered fully \u201cpotty trained\u201d because she simply can\u2019t always help it (especially so if her adoptive family is not very consistent in her potty routine) due to her medication's side effects. Olivia needs to have limited access to drinking water (hand offer only multiple times a day) due to limiting accidents and she has an obsession to drink and will forget to potty first.   Olivia has done well with crate training when her foster family happens to leave the home and seems comfortable there with a fluffy blanket/bed to sleep on and nylabone or two to keep her busy during the night or daytime when her family is away from the home.  If her family works away from the home during the daytime, again, she will need to be let out every 3-4 hours to avoid having accidents in her crate.  Again, she does not do as well \"holding it\" due to the medications she takes for her medical condition. For her safety, we recommend that she keep a similar crating schedule when her humans are away from the home and/or she is left unsupervised so that she is safe and secure while no one is home.\n\n\nMedically, Olivia has a condition called Immune Mediated Polyarthritis (IMPA). Due to this her activity needs to be somewhat limited so as not to put excess stress on her joints. Her potential adopters will need to understand that her medical condition requires them to be diligent in treating her IMPA:  she is on a lifelong Immunosuppressant drugs (approximate cost is $26 a month for her meds). Her current daily regimen is Leflunomide and Prednisone and she requires bloodwork every 6 months for maintenance due to her medications. She is also on a daily joint supplement (Dogzymes Phytoflex) and should also remain on that for the remainder of her lifetime.  Her current joint flareups are mostly controlled  with her medications but she still has good days and bad days. With having an immune disorder, this also predisposes her to other potential illnesses, especially as she ages. Olivia Rose is spayed, microchipped is up to date on vaccinations/deworming and heartworm preventative and has no other known health issues. \n\nOlivia\u2019s ideal home will be a fenced in yard with no pool and/or near any size body of water, and no full flights of stairs (minimal stairs inside and outside are ok) to keep her from having joint flare ups. If her people did not have a fenced yard, that's okay too, very short leashed harnessed walks (no collars) would be just fine. Her people will also need to prevent her from jumping on and off of furniture as much as possible in order to help prevent joint flare ups/damage that would result from her jumping a lot. Above all, she would prefer a family that likes to spend a LOT of time at home and will shower her with lots attention and cuddles. She does not travel well (due to the stress of her joints), and boarding at a facility is not an option for her due to stress, so she would likely require a dog sitter if her adoptive family were traveling out of town without her.  Due to her need for so many potty breaks (every 3-4 hours minimum), she would also be really happy to live with a stay at home dog parent or someone who works from home. She could be a great pup to take to work so long as she was the only pup there (or can be kept separate from other dogs) and if it was a quiet and easy going work environment. If her people are not able to take her to work with them, no problem - she's completely happy sleeping the day away in her kennel with a nylabone to chew on as long as her people can arrange the necessary multiple (every 3-4 hours minimum) mid day potty breaks for her!   \n\n \nIf you feel like your family might be the perfect forever home for Olivia, please submit an adoption application for her today!!",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nButtons is a two year old American Bulldog mix who came to us to find her forever place!  This girl is so happy and a bundle of energy - she needs an active family and a fenced in yard to make sure she can get the time to run around to burn off some of her energy.    \n\nButtons weighs around 60 pounds and would be recommended for kids age 9 and up.  Her size and energy can knock little ones over - she loves kids, but she gets so excited!   Buttons pulls hard on a leash, so she needs someone willing to use a gentle leader or work on other training to help with this.    When Buttons is out for a walk, she gets super excited when she sees kids or other dogs, and she just wants to pull to get to them so she can say hello.  \n\nButtons was surrendered to a shelter because she had too much energy, and she didn't have another dog to play with so she was looking to her humans for everything she needed.  She would chase after the cat in the home.  She would love a playful friend to run around with!   Buttons does good in a crate, but will make a little noise at times when her humans are leaving to go to work for the day.  She will need a little housetraining refresher whenever she moves to a new home because the house set up and the routine is different than what she's used to.   \n\nAfter Buttons came to rescue, we found out that both of her ACL's on her back legs were torn, and would require surgery.  Buttons has had both leg surgeries during 2020 and she is doing fantastic! \n\nButtons loves other dogs and she loves to play!  She is an amazing friendly and happy girl!  \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie @ kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

He is crate trained, a pleaser, and wants to make his people happy.  Flynn would make a great running buddy!  He likes being around other dogs.  Personality wise he loves kids, but may have too much energy for small kids. \n\nIn July 2019 he was found running the streets. Our rescue went out and saved this sweet boy, but no one ever claimed him. \n\nHe is up to date on vaccinations, neutered  and microchipped.  He is on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. Flynn is available for a meet and greet by appointment! \n\nThe rescue is usually at Belleville Petsmart the first Saturday of every month from 11-3. Please let us know if you\u2019d like to meet him there.\n\nAdoption fee is $150",

He was moved to the vet yesterday. & today we found out he was shot with a riffle, that missed his heart by a sliver, the bullet never made an exit and is shattered in him, it should not cause any permanent damage, they clipped - cut and drained it and put a tube in it. He was also neutered, while under. He is heart worm negative. Yay ? \nHe seems like a great dog so far. He will need rest and pain meds to follow. \nIf any one pledged please honor them at the top of the post or by PayPal @ PayPal.me/themylofoundation\n\nHe loves to give extra lovings and wanting to give you kisses. \nHe is a 3 year old Hound mix. Super Friendly with people .\nCan SOMEONE PLEASE HELP HIM Jotform.us/gcurgents/mylo",

My cards were dealt in December 2019, but Valley Animal Center came to my rescue and gave me the second chance at life I deserve. I LOVE to go on walks and although my size maybe intimidating don't worry I'm actually really good on a leash. we have recently came to the realization that Ace may possibly be deaf or hearing impaired. if you have experience with a deaf dog and may be looking to open your home to a lovable giant please consider Ace.To adopt me, please visit valleyanimal.org/adoption-info/ to download the Pre-Adoption Application and email dogs@valleyanimal.org to make an appointment to meet me! \n\n\"also If you are looking for a young dog to take on hiking trips or to the beach, there is nothing I enjoy more than exploring new places so I am definitely the perfect adventure buddy!\" -Ace\n\n\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 75lbs Age: 4yrs 1mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

He is mostly quiet but needs a dog-free environment.\n\nFenced-in yard: Preferred, but not necessary\n\nSpecial needs: Gilbert requires a gastro diet.\n\n\n\nThis handsome dude is searching for his kindred spirit!  He loves every human he meets and every human cannot get over what a lovely boy he is too!\n\n\n\nGilbert came into rescue with severe wounds after being attacked by several other dogs. He has completely healed externally, but he did lose one of his eyelids.\n\n\nAs you can imagine, Gilbert is searching for a home where there are no other pets after his ordeal. He is not good with other dogs and wants very badly to chase cats when he sees them. He doesn\u2019t require a fenced in yard if his people are comfortable walking him knowing he will have a reaction when he sees other dogs out and about. Gilbert would much prefer a fenced in yard where he can follow his nose safely and without the worry of running into other dogs.  He would love play time with his person in the fenced in yard in lieu of walks.\n\n\n\nHis kindred spirit is someone who is home more often than not (although he can be left alone just fine) and understands that Gilbert just wants to love and be loved by his people. Gilbert hasn\u2019t lived with children, but he\u2019s very well behaved with the children that he\u2019s met. Because of his size, we think he\u2019d do better with older children. \n\n\n\nHe is a lover, a best friend, and all the makings of a true soulmate for the right home.  While he has other pet restrictions which may make him harder to place, we also know what he gives back in return is pretty special.  He is worth it.\n\n\n\nGilbert is hoping his forever people love reading - he\u2019s a literary fellow after all! In the words of LM Montgomery, \u201cwhen you are imagining, you might as well imagine something worthwhile.\u201d We imagine that by now you are almost as in love with Gil as we are and are picturing your life together. \n\nIf you think you are a match for Gil, complete our online application: http://www.sitwithme.ca/dogs/gilbert\n",

            "description": "This sweet boy is one of our Hurricane Dorian rescues.  He was pulled out of an overflowing shelter in Georgia by the CORES group (Coalition of Ontario Rescues for Emergency Support), so that dogs displaced from the Bahamas could move in and receive assistance. \n\nSailor is a happy-go-lucky little guy who\u2019s had a hard start to this life.  He doesn\u2019t have good use of his hind end but it doesn\u2019t seem to slow him down.  Sailor loves being around loving humans and enjoys playing with other dogs his own speed, or will happily play on his own.  He can play with other dogs with toys or tug-of-war with a human, or he can participate in \u2018chase-me\u2019 with gentle dogs; he may need to be gently corrected at times when he gets too excited while playing, but overall he\u2019s quite laid back.  One of his favourite things to do is snuggle up with his favourite human or pup to feel secure and loved.  Sailor loves to be outside in nice weather and is the perfect buddy on a warm afternoon.  He is unknown about his interactions with cats or young children.  Sailor does not like loud or sudden noises and will bark at something that startles him.  He sleeps well through the night on his own dog bed.  His foster family describes him as \u2018one of the biggest sweethearts\u2019 they\u2019ve ever fostered.  Sailor loves attention, cuddling, playing, and is just a happy pup.\n\nRequirements:\n-fully secured fenced yard (no electric fence)\n-no apartments\n-if another dog in the home, must be calm and respectful dog that is less than 40 lbs\n-respectful children in the home must be at least 7 years old\n\nMedical Note:  Sailor has had Vertebral malformation at T12 with kyphosis at T12-T13. Which is a compression of his spine due to some kind of trama.  We have consulted with a couple of veterinarians on what we could do for him and unfortunately there is not much that could be done if we are to take into account his well-being and quality of life.  Whoever adopts him will need understand that he does have a disability and be financially stable to take this on in the future if something were to happen down the road, they will also need to understand he cannot be climbing stairs or jumping off furniture as this can cause more damage to his spine.  We are hopeful to see Sailor in a fitted wheelchair soon to help run as fast as he wants to.\n\nBecause of these injuries, Sailor\u2019s bathroom manners will need to be worked with.  At this time, he may still have accidents in the home and can have a difficult time when going in the yard, but his foster family says that he does a pretty good job of keeping himself clean.  It is our hope to see Sailor in a fitted wheelchair to assist with mobility and bathroom issues, which will require a family willing to work with him through his stages of learning.\n\nSCAR does not have the resources to adopt animals to the United States and we can only adopt within a 200 km radius of Windsor, Ontario.  Please do not apply if you do not live in Ontario, within 200 kms of Windsor.\nhttps://secondchanceanimalrescuewe.wordpress.com/adoptdog/",

            "description": "Oreo was found between Ralls and Crosbyton, Texas in August 2019 out in some farmland. He was covered in bite marks and wounds. It looked like he had either had to fend off other dogs, coyotes, or could have possibly been used in dog fighting. He is such a fun dog with a great personality. He has done well with puppies and young submissive dogs but isn't very fond of older dogs or large dogs. Oreo is looking for a home where he is the only dog in the household. He LOVES to play and he loves women. Not sure if someone was mean to him. He is okay with kids but very strong and playful. We do not recommend a home with small children. Oreo needs a large yard with a tall, sturdy fence and a warm couch or bed to cuddle with you on!",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies under 1 year of age.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

He loves to go for walks and once was probably a fabulous walking or hiking partner!   Duke was purchased from a breeder 15 years ago,  has Cushings and bouts of not eating and then wanting to eat the house so basically is a hospice dog.

He is fearful of men, has never shown aggression, ( possibly some mistreatment in his past home life) he just stands far away and barks. With some time, yummy treats and patience he could come around nicelyHe gets along fine with other dogs but does not seek them out to play or for comfort. So he would probably love a home as an only dog and with a momma his primary care giver. Fenced in yard is needed with Austin. Please apply for this handsome guy at russellrescuetn.com",

He is very energetic and will be his best within an active family with older children. He loves cuddling with his cat friends (or just cuddling in general), going for long walks, and curling up on someone's lap on the couch at the end of the day. He would do best in a home without other dogs since he's pretty much alpha.\n\nHe is UTD on shots, HW negative, microchipped, and takes Heartgard monthly.\n\nWhen you need that special someone to share your day with Apollo/CP is the right guy for you!!!\n\nPlease complete our application at:\n\nhttp://www.russellrescuetn.com/application-for-adoption/",

She is house broken and will use pee pads if you prefer. She likes short walks and enjoys the occasional sun bathing outings.\nPenelope has a bad flea allergy and will need to be kept flea free. She has some skin issues that are allergy based but seems to be mainly in summer. (All mine are too!!)\nShe likes to be with her peeps but can be a bit shy in the beginning. She may sneak off during the day for a little alone time and a nap. But ask about her back story and you will want to give her the royal life she deserves!! She loves her cheese piece with coconut oil on it daily(helps keep fleas away) and a light snack before bed time. Just a few little things to lavish her with love.\"\n\nPlease complete our application at:\nhttp://www.russellrescuetn.com/application-for-adoption/",

I may not be a supermodel, but at least I smell nice...well, that's what my foster daddy tells me! I'm 12 inches tall, about 30 inches long from the tip of my nose to the tip of my tail, and I've been working out just weighing in around 15 pounds.\nI love a fenced in yard, watching movies, spontaneous trips, cuddling and learning about all the things I thought I knew but realize I had no idea about. I'm a guy who tries too hard to make you laugh, paws for your attention, and gets along with all types of other life forms. I try to balance family, play, and time for myself, while still enjoy all three.\nMy foster daddy is amazing, but I am really hoping to meet someone(s) special for something more serious. It's a crazy world, so let's be crazy together.\nBronco\nPlease apply for this handsome fella at russellrescuetn.com",

I love people and am great with children. I know sit, down, and stay. I walk great with my harness. I love getting exercise such as going on walks, runs, and hikes. While I do walk nicely alongside other dogs, I can't live in a home with another dog. I also do not like cats or livestock because I have a high prey drive. Since I need to be in a single pet home, that means all of the hugs and kisses can be focused on me! I am very athletic and can climb tall fences; therefore, I need to be leash walked to use the bathroom. Because I am used to shelter life, I will need some strong supervision for at least 3 months which is how long it may take me to feel comfortable in my new home. I am microchipped, spayed, and fully vaccinated. I am optimistic that my forever family will find me soon. Do you have room for me in your family? I would love for you to schedule an appointment to meet me!!",

Chance did wonderfully with the children and now plays with other dogs in his foster home.\n\nChance is spayed and has all necessary vaccinations. She would love to be part of an active household that include her in family activities. She is still a youngster and is full of energy, things to consider when thinking about adoption.\nChance's foster family says she is a fabulous sweet girl.\n\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Chance or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

He is super smart and will jump on lap on command and will get down on command. He was abused so if you try to do those things he is scared of, he will bite, not nip. Once he knows you as he does me after four months, he will trust you but you still have to be careful.

Sweet Potato and her brother Turkey were adopted by a family when they were puppies. However, they were recently returned through no fault of their own. They are still very sweet and very playful! They are high energy dogs so they will need a family that can kept them active. Sweet Potato weighs about 25 pounds and her date of birth is 9/24/2019. \n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet girl at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Sweet Potato.\n",

It is my job to keep my yard safe! I also bark at the suspicious sounds at night. I go to the door and stand when I need to go potty. Sometimes I'm stubborn if I think I can get my way. I have had basic training so I know what no, sit, stay and down means. I need some refreshing sometimes. If there are treats involved I'm always a good listener. I don't share my food or bones though. I like other dogs that respect my personal space and give me some time to make sure they will be nice to me. I don't mind cats if they don't mind me.\n\nShe's a unique dog that needs a unique owner, can that be you?\n&\n\n\nWe are not a shelter, we are a rescue and all of our rescued pets live with a Tennessee foster family until their forever home is found. They are all checked by a veterinarian, current on their vaccinations, spayed/neutered are micro-chipped. Our fosters know the animals best and will give you an honest assessment of their traits and training. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a pet from Saving The Animals Together, please submit an application by clicking on the Adopt tab at www.savingtheanimalstogether.org or email us at statadoptions@savingtheanimalstogether.org \n\n\nAs soon as we receive your application back, we will check your references and then contact you for a telephone interview. At that point the foster will contact you to discuss the pet with you.",

They are high energy dogs so they will need a family that can kept them active. Turkey weighs about 17 pounds and his date of birth is 9/24/2019. He has the cutest underbite, too!\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Turkey.\n",

            "description": "Gracie is in temp foster care and we would like another foster for her as soon as possible. Please contact us if you wish to foster or foster with intent to adopt. If you are interested in adopting Gracie please go to our website www.jcldr.com and fill out an adopt application. No one is obligated by doing so but it is a good starting place.  Long-distance transport can be discussed.\n\nUPDATE FROM TEMP FOSTER 1/2020: Such a sweet, respectful, mellow girl in the house. Love her. Outside very curious,  up for chasing critters for sure, completely different girl. Well rounded. Absolutely no other dogs for now. Respectful through 3-foot gate with other dogs. Just doesn't like her space invaded, quick to react negatively. I always say I would keep her for myself if she was the one and only. \n\nMeet Gracie: She is a spayed female Catahoula, 2 & \u00bd years old, she could be a purebred but appears to be a mix. Weight 68 pounds, up to date on Vaccs, HW tested Negative and is started on Heartguard. Microchipped.  Handles well at the vets but uneasy till she gets acquainted.  (Admin Note: Not unusual with Catahoulas. No major restraints needed.) Crate broken, housebroken, fed twice a day. She seems to be very good about excessive vocal restraint. She is not good with small children, she seems to like 8 to 10-year-old children that are dog respectful.  She is a good companion type dog and not excessively reactive on leash though uneasy when other dogs come around. She would be best an only dog. Gracie was surrendered to a veterinary clinic and we will give detail about that by phone. She has been great at the clinic so far with everyone. There are no men at the clinic so we are not sure if a gender unease is there. She is great with the ones handling her and there are a lot of them. She is not cage reactive, interested as dogs walk by but not tens. Clinic staff has worked with her with treats and she follows basic commands and treat and food respectful with a soft mouth. Such a good dog that has been in the three wrong homes and small children left unsupervised were part of the issue and why she was rehomed twice more. She did not act out with the children. \n\nHISTORY: We don\u2019t know her original history. We know she was thrown in with six dogs and that is a lot stimulus and that is all we know from the first known home. Second home had a small child and probably the dog and baby came to that home about the same time. This home also had a small Pitbull mixed female and they ended up not getting along. She was passed on to a third home after the dog altercation which started mild and escalated. The third home had an 8-month-old baby (ADMIN NOTE: Not a good idea to give a dog that is uneasy with toddlers to another home with toddlers) The new owner moved in with her Mom who had a senior Schnauzer and Gracie had no idea why all this shuffling. She was unsettled, sorting things out and worried no doubt. At first she got on with the little dog, but a day or two things went south. She was taken to clinic to be boarded and found a new home. There was chaos in the first home we know of as the woman had intact dogs and was breeding them. Gracie did show some unease with all of the high stimuli and it was a lot. \n\nGOOD: While at the clinic these are the things that have been observed about Gracie and all agree she is a great dog. We aren\u2019t sure how she will be in the home but she no doubt would be more relaxed in a good home that is a fit for her. She keeps her kennel clean, happy to see everyone and greets all across the board the same. She not very vocal, She has not been on leash much at the clinic so there is no way to know if she is a leash puller or leash reactive. Very food motivated, performing her basic commands. Not reactive in her kennel or cage, only shows excited interest in the cat and we think more negative. No kitties for her. Everyone loves Gracie. Dogs going past her kennel and even excessive barking dogs, she will react a bit with them by barking but only excessive barkers that are next door kennel mates broke her composure. Second owner says that she is a great dog in the house, is totally housebroken, no issues in the car with them traveling, calm and sweet. She is not a kisser but she is a leaner, and wants to be close to you. \n\nBAD: She likes her clean cage so she pushes newspapers out. That is the only bad that has shown up. She roughs it up and pushes it out but she holds her urination and stools for a long long time.  She doesn't like other dogs. \n\n\nUGLY: In the last home where the Schnauzer and Gracie decided they did not like each other, we do not know who started the dog fight. We will try to find out from the previous owner. The older lady in the home, owner of the small dog, reached in on the dog fight and got bitten. A few minor punctures, so Gracie has been in quarantine for the required period of time. Her jail time is up now.  When she was in her second home there was a dog fight in that home between the Pitty girl and her. This was the first big fight but they had other small altercations between them at night while the people were asleep. (ADMIN NOTE: After the first middle of the night fight, one of the dogs should have been crated. Both females and no supervision and no way to know who or what started it)   They had her for almost two years before the fighting started. She was great with the young child who was allowed to crawl all over her but that isn't a wise thing to allow to happen.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Moe. I am a five-year-old chocolate Lab. I have a very soft coat with light brown highlights. I was even mistaken for a puppy because my coat looks so shiny. We go for walks and swim which is my favorite thing to do. I am a super sweet boy but I have some separation and confinement anxiety so I need a family who will have patience with my adjustment period. I am on medication for my anxiety and will need to continue it until I am fully comfortable in my new home. I have been working with a trainer who says I\u2019m a super quick learner. I know sit and paw and I ALMOST do  \u2018down'. I get excited when I meet someone new but my fosters have been working with me to sit when I see someone new instead of jumping. I LOVE my kong toy especially when you put peanut butter inside and retrieving toys you throw in the water. I love to cuddle and sit politely by you when I want attention which is always.\nI\u2019m looking for a special home where I\u2019d be the only pet. I need someone who will work with me on my training. If you think we\u2019d make a good fit, come visit me in Plantation!\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to LRRoF.org NOW and fill out an application.\n\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nYour support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today!\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family. All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.",

He walks perfectly on a leash, enjoys having some space to roam around in and would make a fantastic running partner. \nAlthough he may be able to live with the right dog, he'd prefer to be someone's one and only.

I found an old building in Uptown, and decided to nest in the crawl space for shelter. It was in that crawl space that I delivered my three puppies and nursed them for 3-4 weeks. During that time, a nice man and woman brought me food and water. I was scared of them, and always ran away when they came near, but I was thankful for the nourishment they left for me. They also checked on my puppies, but left them alone so that I could keep taking care of them. \nOver Labor Day weekend, the woman came to visit me and I ran out from under the house. Outside, I found a trail of tasty chicken leading to a metal frame of some kind. I followed the trail, which resulted in her being able to humanely and safely \"trap me\". After I was secure, she transported my puppies and I to her home. Once there, she set us up with a cozy area to rest and nurse. It turns out that the woman discovered that the house we were nestled under was scheduled to be demolished after Labor Day so I am really glad that she saved us!\nI have been in the care of the nice woman ever since. She has helped me raise my puppies, as well as found them loving forever homes where they will never be in harm's way. With the puppies taken care of, now she wants to help me find forever home!\nThe vet estimates that I am about 1.5-2 years old and a Shepherd mix. I like other dogs, but I have not had the chance to meet any kids or kitties yet. I am going to be starting heartworm treatment soon, now that my puppies are all weaned. I am still pretty unsure of a leash, harness, collar, walking scenario. However,, after I get healthy, I promised my foster mom that I will really start working on trying new things and being more open to the idea of love. I am very excited about my future as a Streedog!",

            "description": "True is a loving, intelligent, loyal companion.  She gives hugs and kisses and enjoys her morning cuddles and belly rubs.  She\u2019s eager to please and learn.  She is currently seeking an adoptive home or a foster home while she awaits her forever home.\n  True is considered a medium energy dog, meaning that she likes to run and play ball for about 10-15 times in a row 2-3 times a day and she\u2019s a happy girl.  Or you can take her for a walk.  As long as she gets some form of brief exercise 2-3 times a day, she\u2019s pretty content.  \n  True does well with dogs that are not crazy energy and that will back off when she is done playing.  True is NOT good with cats.  She has an intense prey drive and loves to chase whatever comes into the yard. Squirrels, birds, bunnies, bees, you name it she will chase it.\n  True does have some issues with resource guarding that we are currently working on.  This is the main reason we have decided to say \u201cno kids\u201d to True\u2019s new family. Resource guarding is not that abnormal for a dog that had been on their own for a long time like we believe her to have been, Although it\u2019s not a behavior that should be allowed in a home, when caught early, it\u2019s easily trained out of a dog, but in True\u2019s case, it may be something she struggles with for a long time.  Having said this, it\u2019s important for us to note that she has made vast improvements and has learned \u201cleave it\u201d and \u201cdrop it\u201d commands.  We have learned many of True\u2019s triggers and simply remove them from the environment.  True responds to verbal commands \n  True is on a daily pill for hypothyroidism that manages many of the symptoms she was having when she came to us such as fur loss, dry skin, and soreness.  The medication requires a simple blood test (T4) every few months (depending on how stable her numbers are).  True is doing GREAT on her medication.  She has regrown all of her fur and it can be classified as luscious now.  Her skin is perfect and there is no signs of body soreness at all.  \n  Have additional questions about True?  Feel free to email us.  If interested in fostering or adopting True, fill out the appropriate application at the link below\nhttps://forms.gle/gw9k5r2ArJwJyVm87",

Please consider donating for this sweetie.  We are hoping to raise $500 more to cover her surgery and biopsy expenses. THANK YOU!  \nhttps://www.classy.org/give/266560/#!/donation/checkout\n\n Lil Bit is a frisky little thing at only 4 pounds. She will nudge your arm for attention, which is most of the time.  She loves sitting by your side. This little wee thing is scared of bigger dogs, so no dogs over 8 pounds. Lil Bit has been seen by our vet and is current on all her vaccinations.  Contact us soon to meet her!  Lil Bit loves to layout on a warm day for a little sun. \n\n She is not leash trained, so a home with a secure fence is required.  Lil Bit is pee pad trained, so we are asking for a house that is not fully carpeted. A lot of dogs mistake carpet for pee pads, so we want you to avoid a mess.  Lil Bit is a precious little girl that deserves to be pampered.  We hope you can meet her soon! \n\n Apply today at : https://fs8.formsite.com/Caringhearts/form10/index.html  \n\nApply for them today at : https://fs8.formsite.com/Caringhearts/form10/index.html",

I came aboard from the South Los Angeles Animal Shelter during The Rescue Train's annual Race For The Rescues fundraiser. I am so relieved to be safe and in a nice cozy foster home as the shelter is no place for a sweet ol' fella like me.\n\nMy foster parents say that while I'm pretty chill, but I would do best in an ADULT only home with no children. I am very dog/cat friendly and enjoy being around my people...maybe a little too much! Therefore, my foster parents are helping me build my confidence and be more independent. I am crate trained and working on my house breaking. I'd do best in a home with a dog similar in size and energy level.\n\nSome of my favorite activities are curling up on the couch, cuddling and taking long naps. I LOVE getting attention and praise. The words \"good boy!\" is music to my big cute doggy ears! I have no problem accompanying my humans on long walks...just as long as we're not sprinting in a marathon!\n\nIf you think I'm the right fit for you (and most likely, I am!) please consider filling out an application.  XOXO, Oscar\n\n--\nIf you are interested in adopting OSCAR please go to www.TheRescueTrain.org and fill out our online adoption application on the Adopt A Dog page. Applications are required PRIOR to meeting one of our animals and are used to set up a safe and successful adoption.\n\nPlease don't be shy and answer the questions thoroughly. To learn more about our entire process please visit www.therescuetrain.org and click on the Adopt A Dog page or email us at info@therescuetrain.org.\n\n*APPLICANT MUST BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OLD*\n*APPLICANT MUST LIVE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES*\n\nPLEASE NOTE: WE DO NOT OWN A FACILITY. Our animals are in private foster homes. If you are interested in adopting one of our animals please fill out our online application. Or check our mobile adoption schedule on our home page.",

They even play gently with smaller creatures like cats and rabbits. They are both potty trained and have caught on quickly to simple commands like Sit and Stay. Peaches is the more outgoing of the two. Kiwi is shy at first but quickly warms up. And, both absolutely love each other so cannot be separated. They were born 6/29/2019\n\nWe got both of them from the shelter as itty bitty pups, and soon found out that both of them had CHV (Canine Herpesvirus). Most puppies die at 2 weeks from this, however these two were fighters and besides runny noses here and there, are doing really well.  They can have it the rest of their lifes and will be sick from time to time and because there is just not a lot documented on situations like this we have no idea what their future health could be.  They should never be around puppies or attend public places or events, which is another reason we prefer them to be adopted together. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

He is heartworm negative, neutered, and ready to find his family.\n\nArthur is a very special guy and needs a special adopter. He does have separation anxiety especially for as long as he has been at the shelter.\nHe would do really well with someone who spends a lot of time at home or works from home. \nArthur needs someone that  can help him to feel safe and loved, take him on walks, and let him play in a backyard. \nHe is going to make the best and truest companion. \nHe LLOOOVVVEEESS people and is the biggest snuggle bug for a tough guy. He also likes to be held like a baby. \n\nArthur would need to be an only dog but Arthur will be the only dog you will ever need.\n  \n\nARE YOU THE ONE ARTHUR HAS BEEN WAITING SOOO LONG TO MEET?\n\nPlease contact The Horn Lake Animal Shelter for more information and to set up an appointment today.",

I am spayed, heartworm negative, current on shots, micro-chipped and on flea/heartworm prevention.  My adoption is $200.\n\nI was originally adopted when I was just a small puppy.  I have gone through training and am, in general, a very well behaved dog and great companion.  I was returned to the rescue because my owner moved into a home without a yard and now that I have to be leash walked, it has become difficult because I can be a bit territorial with other animals.\n\nFor the most part, I can be near other pets, however, I can have the propensity to become overbearing and forceful with them so it would be best for me to go to a home without other pets.  While I am not outwardly aggressive in nature, I would also do best without kids.\n\nIf I could get a dog savvy owner who is looking for a pal, I would do great.\n\nPlease email for an adoption application.\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

I'll tell you a bit about me-\n\nBreed: Lab/Pittie/Husky mix\nEstimated age: 5 years old\nHouse & crate trained\n\nFavorite Things:\n-Laying on my humans hehe! I may be 60 pounds but I sure do love being a lap dog! Snuggling is great!\n-When humans play fetch with me! Especially when they use that 'Chuck-It' thing that makes the tennis ball go super far\n-Squeaky toys! I betcha I could hear a squeaker from a mile away\n-Exploring! I like going on walks so I can sniff all the things\n-I even get along with kitty cats\n-I get along well with other doggies and love to wrestle\n-Getting lots of ear scratches and belly rubs\n\nNot-so-Favorite Things:\n-Riding in the car\n\nSeeking:\n-Home with a 6ft privacy fence\n-Home with kids over the age of 12 due to energy level\n-Family willing to work with me on my leash training. I am part husky, so I naturally pull on leash, and will need humans to help me learn.\n- Henry likes a close nit group of pals rather than being surrounded by four-legged strangers, so the dog park/bar isn't his scene \n\nBefore emailing- please read:\n- Yes, this dog is available for adoption\n- The adoption fee for Henry is $256\n- Apply at c2cnd.org\n- The adoption fee covers their age appropriate shots, microchip, deworming, spay/neuter, and any other medical expenses while in our care.\n- Local adopters only. Due to our thorough adoption process including home visits, we limit our adoptions to local families in the greater Charlotte area.\n- If you have any additional questions, email us at dogs@c2cnd.org and we will respond as soon as possible!",

If you're looking for a great gal with a winning personality, then Annie is the perfect pup! She is a well behaved, active girl who loves people. She is a sweetie pie who likes to cuddle and be loved on.\n\nAnnie is a gorgeous girl who is young at heart. She may be in her double digits but you'd never know it from her zest for life! Her favorite thing to do is play! Tug-of-war is her favorite game and she takes every opportunity to play with her toys. She is described by her foster as entertaining, charming, silly and affectionate.\n\nShe has a great smile and adorable ears that perk right up. Not only does she have good looks and the perfect personality, but she has smarts too! Annie is a loyal girl who is well trained and attentive. She is potty trained, walks well on a leash, knows 'sit' and 'come' and makes for the perfect companion. She'd be happy to be your one and only or could have a doggy sibling and would do best in a home without small children.\n\nFor adoption information or to complete an application, please go to: http://www.pawsinthecity.org/adopt.htm\n\nReferences and a home visit are required for all adoptions.",

Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 7/13/18\n\nReason for being in rescue: Found as stray along with a chihuahua one minute from the rescue by a CPR employee. We suspect they were left for us to find.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Lois has a whole lot of special going on. When found, Lois had heartworms. No sooner did we clear those out of her body than she tore both of her back leg cruciate ligaments. This is the ligament that makes the knee work. Oh and she's got a cherry eye that was repaired but it pops back out on its own. Lois has has an epulis which is benign proliferative gum tissue often seen in Boxers.\nIt can be removed but may recur over a longer period of time.\n\nWeight: Estimated 65 lbs and that is way too much. She needs to be about 50 lbs. She gained a lot of weight during her knee surgeries.\nHeight: 24\" at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 Lois is priceless\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Lois is a sweetheart of a girl who got handed the short straw when it comes to medical challenges. Her new owner should understand that and know she will be high maintenance, She could be an only dog or share her home with another laid back big dog. She has not spent much time with little dogs since her buddy the chihuahua was adopted. Her new owner will understand that long walks around the block are not in the cards for Lois. She may enjoy swimming as that would be easy on her knees but we've not had her in a pool.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Lois is a young boxer mix who was found as a stray near our rescue in SC. However, we found her owner about a month after Lois was found and the owner, when she found out Lois had heartworms, never came for her.\n\nLois is an incredibly sweet girl, with a gentle soul. She gets along well with other dogs and is in a family grouping with Maude the Great Pyrenees and Rafiki the Standard Poodle. She loves to lay on her couch and relax. She loves laying in the sun on the front porch and watching the world go by, She knows how to sit on command and is motivated by treats to learn more tricks. Lois loves squeaky toys and has been known to steal them and collect them at her place in her space. We don't know how long she was out on the streets and she as shy at first but fast forward 18 months and all the handling fixing her many medical issues and that has changed. To those of us who know and love her, she is beautiful and fabulous.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? It depends on the person and the place. Lois can be protective of her space. For those she knows and trusts, she is loving and affectionate (and forever hopeful your carrying treats). For those she does not know, you need to be introduced properly or you will not pass her threshold. This may also be pain related as her legs are still not really right. She is overweight and she needs to lose weight to get the pressure off of the, and that's a slow process with bad bum knees.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Lois was found with the Chihuahua mix, Rio. Rio has been adopted. Lois is truly a rescue. She needs someone who would love a challenge, wants to give a sweet dog a chance, and understands that life is precious. Especially a life affectionately known as Lois\n\nHouse trained? Lois goes outside to do her business here at the farm on our schedule and routine. Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. 90 lb big athletic guy\n\nKaizen is an athletic and happy young adult Akita male. In his prior circumstances, he was confined to a small area so he very much appreciates space to roam around in. He loves his toys and his adult humans and is eager to learn. He thrives on consistency, routine and exercise but should not live with children because unpredictability and even controlled chaos can be overwhelming for him. He would do best in an Akita experienced home as an only pet. Kaizen is quite the ham and loves to throw his toys to himself when no one is looking!! He absolutely LOVES water and is always a happy guy when splashing in his pool or being sprayed with the hose!! Even though he is tolerant of other dogs while on leash and is happy to run races with them through the fence, he's not too keen on sharing. He is a very handsome boy who just needs the right person or couple to make his life complete. Kaizen is a one in a million Akita boy that wants to know what having a loyal akita home is all about!

Given the opportunity Rosie will want things her own way but the little lady takes instruction like a pro!  She LOVED her sessions in training and will be best suited for a home that does want to embrace her love of training, even if just sits, downs, and agility type exercises.\n\nThe trainer noted that the ideal home for Rosie would be one with a retired person or couple.  Rosie's best quality is her love of humans!  The trainer was clear that Rosie showed no aggression toward humans and loved to cuddle, especially on the swing at the training kennel.\n\nRosie is currently in a foster home as an only dog, she is a 4 year old bulldog mix who is utd on her shots and spayed.  Rosie does have a very high prey drive and cannot live with cats.  She loves running with her foster mom.\n\nIf you are looking for a winter cuddle buddy and a summer swing companion, Rosie is your girl! \n\nAdoption Application Link:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSew-jHp1KGF--EtRihMrBHkGVAVlnrDYFYW9TcEjf7r5lMCZg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1",

He is a bouncy and happy hound-shepherd blend who weighs in at about 52 lbs. He appears to like some dogs but not all. He has been friendly towards people. He may be a good running partner for an active person.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

The mom was a purebred Husky and the dad was a husky Shepherd so Buster has some Shepherd but is mostly Husky (he was born in Jan 2017)   \n\nHe is a very sweet and happy spirit, playful and friendly!  \n\nHe is crate trainedand was house-broken but has been a backyard dog the past couple of years so he will need time to adjust to being in a real home again.....\n\nHe comes from a large family of Husky's,that are now in San Jose.  There were 5 siblings, 2 of his sisters have already been adopted....and the owner is going to keep the parents and 2 of the other siblings as they are less adoptable.  \n\nBUSTER is adoptable, but he needs some basic obedience training, don't they all??  \n\nHe's good with kids but probably older kids (at least 10 years) so that they can hold their own because he is jumpy...... \n\nHe has only lived with his family since he was a puppy so we aren't completely sure how he would behave around other dogs......!  He might be dominant  so this needs a little more evaluating!\n\nWe always recommend a meet and greet so that people can judge for themselves if the dog is in their comfort zone or not!  If not, that's absolutely fine, there's no obligation to adopt!  So please feel free to come out and meet him sometime!   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n",

Car and golf cart rides are some of his favorite activities, since he likes to watch the scenery and be with his people. He's very smart and has gone through the Canine Life and Social Skills Class in which he learned all of his basic commands. He also loves to do nose work and makes the cutest snuffling noises as he finds every last treat before running over wiggling his whole body while wagging his tail to show you how well he did. Hank is a smart boy who would love to meet you today and become your new best friend, especially if you bring cookies!",

She came to us 3 1/2  years ago from an owner surrender and is so scared of everything (men especially, loud noises, cars, delivery trucks, sudden movements, etc)!  Who knows what she's gone through to get her to this stage; we basically have determined her unadoptable because of all her fears.   After this many years, she has accepted her foster family as part of her pack, even though she still barks at her foster dad when he comes into the room from a dark room.  Poor baby!  She has too high a prey drive so NO cats!  She dotes on her foster mom though and will allow her to do just about anything, including cuddle in the chair like the picture!\n\nThat doesn't mean that we don't provide her with food, vetting, and any other needs.   She recently was seen by PAN's vet because  she's been limping on her rear right leg for some time and it's not getting any better.   She will probably be on meds for her pain/arthritis long-term which also requires bloodwork to make sure that her kidneys are functioning properly.  \n\nRayna is spayed and micro-chipped and is kept current on her vaccinations.  Our main page has her as our featured pet and feel free to donate or sponsor Rayna in our quest to make her life more pain-free.   \n",

When we saw that face we just couldn\u2019t turn him away. Who wouldn\u2019t want to help this guy? He\u2019s amazing! Mars loves humans of all sizes and enjoys any time can gets to play with children. Don\u2019t let the age throw you off. He looks for fun and playtime with anyone that comes his way. He also enjoys playing with other dogs. He is not good with cats, rabbits, squirrels, etc. \nOur trainer had an opening and has been fostering him so a bonus, this handsome sweet guy is also getting a wonderful lesson on manners.

            "description": "If you can see this dog, she is AVAILABLE. We hide them from view once adopted.\n\nSay hello to Jingle Bells. This beautiful girl is a lab mix whose estimated DOB is 12/2012. Jingle Bells is such a loving girl! She will be a loyal and loving girl to a very lucky person. Jingle Bells doesn't need much to make her happy. Just an occasional walk, a comfy bed to lay on, a full food bowl, and a loving human by her side. This sweetheart has so much love to give and can't wait to find her human who will never leave her!\n\nJingle Bells is currently in a foster home and has decided she would like to be an only dog. She is extremely devoted to her person, but doesn't love to share with other dog friends. She does ok during an encounter on a walk, so she is not reactive, but she would just prefer her dog friends stay in their own lane. Jingle Bells is quite afraid of men, so a slow intro to men is a must, she is very uneasy about men who come to visit that she does not know. A calm home without a ton of activity is best for this lady.\n\nThis dog is heartworm positive. We have started them on the \"slow-kill\" method of heartworm treatment, but we advise adopters to work with their vets to determine a plan of action. Their adopter will continue treatment once adopted, and arrange a treatment plan with their vet. Dogs with heartworms lead long, happy lives post-treatment!\n\nThere is no set adoption fee for this dog. In lieu of an adoption fee we are asking for a donation to our shelter to help us care for these babies and keep them safe. We do not receive any funding so any donation is greatly appreciated\n\nWe can offer transport for in-state adopters that cannot make the trip to the shelter.\u00a0\u00a0There is a flat transport fee of $50 to have this dog brought to you.\u00a0\u00a0(This does not apply to meet-and-greets, which must be done at the shelter by appointment only).\n\n\nADOPTION FEE AND HEALTH INFORMATION\n\nUpon adoption, she will have received:  age appropriate vaccines (2 DHPP vaccine), (Bordetella vaccine), (Rabies vaccine if 12 weeks and older), up to date on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, spay or neuter of pet, bi-weekly worming, microchip, fostering costs, and health certificate.\n\n\nAPPLY\n\nIsn't she sweet? Wondering what's next?\n\nYou MUST fill out an application to adopt. Please copy and paste the Google form URL Below:\n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/YKPbHaym6keQA6772\n\n\nOnce you have submitted an application, we do our best to work efficiently to process them. That being said, we are all volunteers that handle adoptions on top of full time jobs, so at times processing can take up to two weeks. \n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nQ: Where is she located?\nA: She is currently at our shelter in Arkansas. She must be adopted locally due to her heart worm status.\n\n\nQ: I would like to set up a meet and greet!\nA: Please fill out an application!  Once approved, we can set up a time where you can go meet her at the shelter.\n\n\nQ: I have more questions!! Who do I contact?\nA: Please e-mail adopt@humanesocietyofthedelta.org directly. We DO NOT answer adoption questions or inquiries on any other platform.\n\n\nQ: I am under 21, will you adopt to me?\nA: Unfortunately, we do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n\nQ: I would like to surprise my family with a dog! Can I do this?\nA: Unfortunately, no. If there is more than one decision-maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement. \n\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!",

NO SMALL CHILDREN - 10 YEARS OLD AND OLDERGryffin is my name! Yes, I am just this happy and silly. I am a shy little munchkin that needs my sister Gracie. I love to cuddle and spend time each night snuggling down on my foster mom's lap with Gracie. I am a sweet boy. I love to play in the yard with the other fur kids. Mom has lots of trees and plants and we play tag all day long. I love to lay on our pillow in the sun. Mom works in the yard a lot so we are always watched when we are outside. We have a doggie door, so along with the big dogs can come and go as we need to.\nIn the house, we have a cat tunnel that we play with. It is so funny to run through and make all that crackling noise. I wait until one of my siblings is in the tunnel and then I pounce on them. They squeal - then we run and find a ball or a rope to play tug with.\nHe was found with his Litter mates in a box next to a dumpster. Who would do that to us? We were saved, and given all the love and care a little girl could ever need. And now, I am getting ready to find my forever home!\nI am going to be a very small dog, so mom says NO Small Children in my future. Tiny bones break too easily.\nI AM EXTREMELY BONDED WITH MY SISTER, GRACIE, SO WE NEED A FOREVER HOME TOGETHER! If you are interested in meeting me, please apply! I am only doing private meetings. =========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He loves to give kisses in return for lots of pets and belly rubs. Unfortunately, Klint has been bounced in and out of a few homes as they didn't have time for him, leaving him alone for 12-13 hours per day. Due to this, he is a dog that does not want to be left alone for long periods of time and prefers a home that will give him the time and attention her deserves.\n\nKlint is in a foster home where he has been learning how to be a great pet. Klint loves being outdoors and thrives in an environment where he can explore outside without interacting with other dogs or strangers. He requires a fenced-in backyard, where he can spend time lying in the sun, and rolling in the shady grass to cool off. He's playful and enjoys chew toys and fetch, especially if there's treats involved! He's well mannered in the home and loves attention, and lots of belly scratches, from his favorite people.  \n\nKlint enjoys the company of ladies, long walks and kids that are 10+ due to his size, he can get pretty wiggly when he is excited! Klint was mistreated by a man previously and can be a bit apprehensive around new men and needs time to warm up and build trust. Once he has it, he is as loyal as they come.\n\nHe would like to be the only pet and he does not enjoy the company of cats or other small critters. Klint is neutered, UTD on his shots and micro-chipped. His adoption fee is $200.00.",

Tre is a medium energy young dog that would do best in an adult only home. He is eager to please and loves treats. In his foster home he is crate trained, house trained, and learning his basic good manners. He is neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated. His adoption fee is just $50 dollars because he is sponsored in honor of Bill Armaline's birthday, and includes four weeks of Good Manners Classes.

Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nYOU MUST READ VERY TOUCHING STORY!!! VIDEO!!!UPDATE 7/28/2020:\nKilburn, an Australian Shepherd (mix), and Jasmine (a Beagle) came to us on 7/5/19, after their owner (a generous supporter of Almost Home) passed away. Both dogs were terribly overweight. Little Jasmine was quickly adopted but Kilburn didn't share her same luck. When Kilburn arrived, he was 5 years old, weighed 106 pounds, and seemed depressed from all the drastic life changes in his life. But once he got to know us and learn we were friends, he begged for belly rubs and gave us his trademark, full-face Kilburn smile. He is now 6 years old and weighs a healthy 57 pounds-he has lost half his body weight. (Kilburn's birthday is 11/8/13. He looked like a little bear when he was born.)\nHe seemed on his way to find happiness, when suddenly his rear legs gave out. We were afraid for him. The diagnosis was that he'd had a bout of FCE ( https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/fibrocartilaginous-embolusemboli-fce-in-dogs ). Luckily, he recovered as if nothing ever happened, and Veterinarians say it is rarely recurrent. This is great news and his legs have been working great since that event.\nThe much thinner Kilburn is quite perky and his handsome face and happy brown eyes hide the loss he endured a year ago. He is more than ready for a home of his own now. Who can resist that waggling bob-tail that makes him look as if a black and tan teddy-bear came alive? Sometimes, he will even stretch a paw out to get you to notice him. He loves to be brushed too.\nKilburn has tried new homes twice but was returned because he tried to protect things he was afraid would be taken away. He let folks know he thought food was too yummy to share. He also tried to explain that he was picky about dogs he might need to live with. He might prefer to just live with his people and be the most important to them.\nThis poor dog has suffered so much loss in such a short time, he needs someone to let him know that he doesn't need to lose anything more. He loves a belly rub or a good scratch of the butt and may back right up into your hand to get one. He also loves to chase and retrieve squeak toys. He enjoys easy leash walks and is a good listener if you want to sit and talk. Kilburn keeps his room clean (an indication he is housed trained and/or would be easy to be) and like us can't resist a good nap in his own comfy bed.\nWhile he is in his dream world, we imagine he sees himself in a calm household with people who are understanding and want to share their hearts with his. He would do best in a home without children and/or children that visit.VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED. Visit our website for more info: http://nelsonspca.org",

He loves to go on long walks, play ball, and curl up with a good chew toy. He is a high energy dog so a yard is a plus for Davey. After exercising he settles down for a nice massage and a peanut butter kong. We are currently looking for an experienced foster with no other dogs Initially in the NYC area. We will provide Davey\u2019s foster hero with everything needed to care for him.\n\nWe rescued Davey from ACC after a good samaritan found him laying on a busy road here in Queens. He was emaciated and suffered trauma resulting in a fractured pelvis, completely split lip, and cuts and scrapes.\n\nWhen we pulled Davey to safety his first stop was our orthopedic surgeon and primary vet for medical care. After 6 weeks with us his body had healed but he still had some emotional healing to do so we teamed up with one of our trusted trainers who has worked extensively with Davey on basic commands, manners, impulse control and leash work. We are excited for Davey\u2019s future. To help make his dreams come true apply at Zionsmission.org",

            "description": "Welcome to the Wonderful World of Rescue Dachshunds. Look around and read their bios. Find a few whose personality seems to fit well. Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\n\nMeet Sandy Mae! She's a gracious, senior lady standard dachshund mix. While we don't know her back story, she's obviously had a loving home at one time. She came in spayed, heartworm negative, and completely house trained.\n\nSandy is in the early stages of dog dementia or CCD - Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. But don't let that concern you, she is a wonderful, sweet, and calm pup! She recognizes her foster family and is happy to meet new people. She follows her family around and hangs out where her foster sibling dogs are. She loves taking naps in her dog bed and keeps herself busy with kongs and exploring the house.\n\nShe gets along with dogs - big and small - and doesn't mind the cat either. She explores the foster home often and is always wanting to be where you are. She doesn't bolt out the door and will stay by your side when outside. She doesn't care too much for toys, but will look longingly into your eyes for treats!\n\nIf you would like to meet this beautiful lady, she can be seen at various adoption events around San Antonio or schedule a meet and greet! If you would like to sponsor her while she waits for her forever home, please click the Sponsor This Pet button above.\n\nPUPDATE: Sandy Mae is doing well. She loves to hang out with her foster family and is a wonderful help around the house! She perks up when going for walks and gets a bounce in her step. Nighttime can be a little confusing for her, but once she sees her humans, she relaxes and will drift back to sleep.\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab.

            "description": "DOB: 4/30/2015\nWeight:  88 lbs\n\nHi! I'm Atlas, a staffi/ lab mix. I am 5 years old. Here is my story: \nI originally lived in a home with another dog and small children. I didn't really mind the other dog for the most part, but I didn't like the little child constantly messing with my food, toys, and in my face. I started growling and becoming aggressive. From that point on, I developed food and toy aggression. It's been a work in progress, but I still have ways to go with it. I was surrendered for that reason, other than that- I did great with the child. I would be okay in a home with children who understand personal space and not make me feel cornered even though I am 85+lbs- so older kids. I would be great in a home where my owners understood my developed aggression and continued to help me improve. I know I look intimidating, but the reality is, I'm confused and not really sure why I ended up here. Most people overlook me because I look \"scary\". I am really just a big happy go lucky baby. Some things I do love: cuddling, trying to be a lap dog even though I'm way too big, and treats!",

She has been socialized with older large breed and small breed pups. She is playful & has high (puppy) energy so I'm careful that she doesn't play to rough. She hasn't met any kitty cats but we can do a meet/greet.  Snickers loves treats and will catch them mid air. She is very smart and already knows how to sit and has  learned to walk on her leash. My favorite part of her personality is how incredibly affectionate she is. She literally melts into your arms. Contact me by text to receive our adoption questionnaire.423-653-9895",

He will need a reinforced crate (corners clipped with leash clips or zip ties) because he can get a tiny bit anxious when he doesn't know where his people are. He just needs a little time to realize that you will be coming back and will do much better when crated. We think he may be housebroken. He rarely ever uses the bathroom in his run. He is very clumsy, goofy and playful, at a whopping 60 pounds. Alex will make an excellent companion for someone who's willing to be a little patient with him. \n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our foster animals! The first step in the adoption process is submitting an application. Please visit our website for more information and a link to the application: www.kgarl.org/info/adoption\nJesse is a very special girl, who is looking for her forever home. She was found as a stray and ended up at King George Animal Control, from there, she was pulled by the King George Animal Rescue League (KGARL). Jesse is currently in a foster home and is doing very well. She loves to play with the other dogs in the home but in the evenings, she's content to take a nap on the couch.\n\nJesse is very smart and very food motivated. She learned \"sit\" and \"down\" within minutes of arriving at her foster home. Jesse has some issues with possessiveness, which is very well managed with consistent rules. She needs an owner who is willing to continue working with her.\n\nIf you think Jesse is the dog for you, please submit an application at www.kgarl.org/adoptAdoption process\n\nOnce your application is received, the application process begins. We will review your application, check your references, check with your vet (if there are other animals in the household), speak to a landlord (if you rent), and arrange for a home visit.\n\nSubmitting an application does not guarantee a specific dog or cat. We strive to match the personality and needs of our foster dogs and cats to a family who will best fulfill those needs. If a family is not approved for a particular pet, it does not mean they will not be a good pet owner, it just means that their needs and the needs of the particular pet don't match. We do not adopt on a \"first come, first serve\" basis.\n\nPlease note that we do not do same day adoptions. If you are applying for a popular animal (such as puppies, small dogs, or special breeds), it can take several days for our volunteers to reach a decision that is best for the animal. We understand that it's difficult to wait, but please don't email us multiple times a day to check on the status of your application. We are a very small group and the same people that are reviewing your application are also replying to hundreds of emails and facebook messages. We are all volunteers and have full time jobs outside of KGARL, so any time spent replying to emails/messages is time we are not reviewing your application.\n\nOnce your application is pre-approved (meaning, we don't see any red flags based on our preliminary review of your application), the applicant may be invited to meet their potential family member at a location convenient to the foster family (usually at the King George Petco). Adoptions will NOT take place at the meet & greet, this is just a chance for us to get to know you and for you to spend time with our animals. After the meet and greet, we will ask that you spend some time thinking over your decision and we will do the same.\n\nAfter the application review process is complete (meet & greet with animal, home visit, reference/vet checks, background check, etc.), if all is acceptable to both adopter and KGARL and we all agree to move forward, we will schedule a day/time to finalize the adoption. The adopter will be asked to sign the final paperwork and we will collect the adoption fee (cash, check, or paypal are all acceptable). At this time, you can either pick up your pet, or schedule a time to do so. Adopters will be required to schedule an appointment with their veterinarian of choice within 10 days of taking your new pet home.\n\nAll Adoptions Include:\n\nLifetime of free advice from KGARL!\n\nSpayed or Neutered Pet\n\nHeartworm, FIV, Feline Leukemia Testing\n\nComplete medical records\n\nUp to date on core vaccines\n\nOn Flea/Tick Preventative\n\nMicrochipped\n\nSample of Pet Food\n\nAdoption Fees (unless otherwise noted in the pet's description):\n\nSpecial Breeds of Dogs: See pet's description\nPuppies: $400\nAdult Dogs : $350\nAdult Hounds and Beagles: $250\nKittens: $125\nAdult Cats: $100",

She had been relinquished by her owners for no apparent reason. Her age was initially given as 2 years old and then upgraded quite a few years, but we estimate her to be 5-6 years old. We found that Tonga isn't necessarily compatible with certain female dogs, but she has done well with large males. She seems to be much more of a \"people dog\" though and is accustomed to bulling her way through an open door to be with her humans. Tonga is solidly-built, probably German Shepherd and Rottweiler mix, weighing over 60 pounds.",

It is clear that she has been a mamma at least once in her life (probably many times) and several calluses point to her not having a lot of soft bedding to sleep on. She was in otherwise good shape and now that she's spayed, she is ready to find a new home. Eden isn't a hyper dog but she is active and would be a wonderful addition to a family that likes to go for walks, hikes and other active outings. She can live peacefully with other dogs but she can also be bossy so it will be up to her owners to give her appropriate boundaries around food and sleeping areas. A little training will go a long way with this lovely girl.  She is lovely with people though, outgoing and friendly with everyone she has met so far.",

Unfortunately, that means we are bound by our contract with the shelter to not place him with children or other animals, despite the fact that his ex-owners said he's good with small kids and other dogs. What we're hoping for is a home where his new owner will not have small kids or other animals, but where Dobbie may have visits from the owner's grandchildren or neighbor children. We think it's sad that shelters are making our judgment calls for us on dogs' suitability for certain homes when they really don't know our breed! A majority of our dogs can be reactive to other dogs when on leash. Anyway, Dobbie is strong, so he'll need work on leash, and he's also been only an outside dog, so he'll need to learn house manners also. He's about 5 years old and he's a big boy; about 90 pounds.",

What this means in Rockfords case is he will understand what your breath is saying! It's an incredible gift actually to be able to share communication with a dog like Rockford.\n\nWE so love seeing this sweet chocolate brindle boy be relaxed and content & so unlike the petrified puppy who arrived to us with burned skin, thin, wormy and sickly!\n\n?Rockford has always come to life in the company of other dogs and we have used that to help him find HIS way to befriending people.. Rockford is a dog that will require dedication and loyalty.. he doesn't trust new people easily, not in an  aggressive way, just so incredibly reserved. Life has told him that is the way to keep himself safe.. Once in Rockford's trust circle, it is so rewarding to watch his layers unfold!! \n\nFor more info on Rockford and his journey, visit our website.. better yet, fill out an application to come give this darling a boy a chance! \n\n***While we are very grateful for PetFinder, we have been having chronic problems receiving inquires. Please contact us directly if you are interested in adopting by emailing us at lovedogs.bedfordny@gmail.com and visit fortheloveofdogsrescue.org***",

In true retriever form, Pumba LOVES jumping in water and getting as dirty as possible. He also really enjoys chasing bubbles, water from the hose, tennis balls, you name it! Pumba was kept outdoors prior to arriving at ECPR so he has a few quirks, but he is super snuggly and loving with people. He must be the only pet in the home and can only live with sturdy children because he doesn't know just how big he is! If you're looking for the most lovable lug, consider adopting Pumba!\n\nPumba is current on vaccines, neutered and microchipped.",

            "description": "Leia was born around November 13, 2018.\n\nLeia was living in a home with Chloe, but they were surrendered to a high-kill shelter because their owners could no longer afford to keep them.  Leia is affectionate and always aware of her surroundings -- she doesn't miss anything!  Whether Leia is having a chat with you or letting you know she sees something that she thinks requires your attention, you'll always know what's going on.\n\nLeia does well crated -- she settles down and keeps it clean.  When crated during adoption events, she barks at other dogs when they approach the crate.  Dogs often do this simply because they're confined and feel the other dog is encroaching in their space.\n\nLeia would do best as a single dog in the household and should not go to dog parks, etc., since she is selective on who she considers a potential friend.  A fenced yard is necessary for Leia and unless it is a privacy fence, there should be space between the neighbor's fence to alleviate negative \"fence play\".\n\nLeia weighs 46 pounds, she is spayed, on heartworm and flea preventative and she is microchipped.\n \nADOPTION EVENTS -- Meet some of our available dogs and cats on the 1st Saturday of each month at the Avon PetSmart (noon to 2:30 pm)\n\n**SCHEDULE A SPECIAL MEET AND GREET**\nSubmit an application to set up a meet and greet during the week, evenings, and other Saturdays throughout the month.\n\nApplication, Costs, and Procedure\nPlease email us to request an application. It contains details about the adoption fee and other information about the adoption process. You can also visit our website at arkfostercare.com and download an application.\n\nFax your completed application to 317-203-0722 or email it to: arkpets@hotmail.com\n\nQuestions can only be answered by email.",

I am house trained and know some cool tricks. I live for fetch but seem to forget to give it back after you throw it! I am needing a privacy fenced yard to stretch these legs, so no apartment life for me! I am working hard on leash training. I will have it down in no time though. I am great with older kids and other dogs. Another high energy dog in my forever home would be fabulous! Fill out an application and we will be rocking this forever life together in no time! \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

She's very smart and enjoys clicker training and performing a job. She would be amazing for someone experienced with training and managing behaviors. She's a gorgeous girl with a lot of love to give.",

Sometimes the bigger ones can intimidate him and he tries to act mean, but if they are patient and try and play, he softens in no time and realizes he has a fun playmate. He is looking for a wonderful forever home that will see how truly special this guy really is. He is a lovable sweetheart, just looking for a family.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nI can co-exist with dogs of all sizes, and boy, do I love my walkies.\nMy tongue is permanently sideways, no idea why but all the humans around me say it's from an old injury. I am the messiest eater- so highly suggest either a Neater Feeder or someone who likes to clean my mess up daily :)\n*Update 9-29-2020* September update on Mr. Coleman: He had a quiet summer after the first 4 months in his current foster home was spent mostly recovering from surgeries. We're still monitoring his cancer, he's got several new lumps that are being monitored but were still too small for the U to be able to get samples to test for cancer. The large tumor that was removed is not showing any significant signs of regrowth so that is really good news!\n\nHe does still battle pretty severe separation anxiety (covid has not helped this as the foster human now works from home full time so the work previously done with him on easing this anxiety has been mostly undone by the fact he's rarely alone now). He would do best in a home where his humans can be home most of the time.\nWe have made quite a bit of progress on his car anxiety. For long rides we are giving him CBD to help him calm down some as he can no longer take trazadone due to adverse reactions post-op. Now that he knows not all car rides end up in a new home or at the vet he seems to not be as stressed. He likely will have some regression here during the transition to a new home, but it's great to see he doesn't always hate car rides!\nOver the course of summer we've learned he really only likes walks on his terms and will occasionally protest them by trying to turn around and return home as soon as he does his business. However, regular slow walks are good for his hips/knees and to keep him slim!\nColeman will tolerate small humans but a quieter home is definitely preferable as he's very scared of loud noises, yelling (whether directed at him or not) makes him very nervous and he will cower if he hears yelling. He does do well with most other dogs & likes to play in very small bursts and not daily! He's a lazy old man at heart so prefers to snooze on the couch and get pets over too much physical activity. Stairs are still a problem, he panics, so a home with limited stairs is still best for him.\nColeman would make a great addition to the right family!\n\n*Update 5-23-2020* Coleman is so excited to share that he's been given the all clear to resume regular activity, including walks and hot laps around his foster human's backyard! Friday was a really good day for Coleman! He has to build to full activity to ensure no set backs from his surgical incision but things are looking very good two months post op.\n\nAs a reminder, Coleman is available for adoption but does come with a few special needs. Coleman does have cancer, we've removed as much of the tumor as possible off his back leg with two surgeries but his furever home should know it will likely grow back and the U of M Oncology department does recommend keeping an eye on it for quality of life purposes. He also has a large tooth that will need to be extracted but he needs a break from surgeries for awhile.\nColeman also can't go to a home with stairs he would need to do daily. Both his last foster home and current have noticed similar issues, he's scared of them and he will slip and trip on them. One or two to go outside is fine, but a full set or split level set is out. Too risky for this old fella! A fenced in backyard is also preferred as he had some bathroom issues at his last foster who did not have a fenced in yard, but he's done well in his current foster home after settling in!\nColeman does have separation anxiety as well. He was making progress there before his surgery but he would do best in a quiet home with his people there most of the time. He's been a very big fan of the fact his foster human is working remotely indefinitely.\nOverall Coleman is a great dog who has some medical needs and is the messiest eater and drinker ever! He's got a lot of spunk left and loves joining in on walks and playtime, but does run out of energy fast during play time! He loves naps on the couch by the human and also firmly believes the human's bed is his own.\n*Update 3-23-2020*\nColeman is back at the U for his next surgery. At his Oncology consult they too recommended we try to remove the remaining tumor and gave us a less invasive option that should hopefully still be very successful. He is otherwise a very healthy boy for his age so MNBR decided to move ahead with this surgery. His tumor was continuing to grow quite rapidly, so over time it would cause him quality of life issues due to the lack of skin on his leg, especially since so much was removed during his first surgery.\nWhile the U is on a reduced surgery schedule and only doing emergency cases they agreed that fitting Coleman in ASAP was important to get the surgery done before the cancer grew/spread any further.\nHis foster mom asks you all send him some positive thoughts tonight, as it's his first night away from her and with his anxiety it will be hard on him, and especially tomorrow morning during surgery. We won't know the full scope of what they will remove until they are in there but Coleman could very likely end up with a flap and a drain and a month of sutures so he's in for a rough couple of weeks. He healed really well last time, even after busting a couple of stitches, so hoping this will repeat and we'll be taking advantage of his foster mom's temporary COVID remote working schedule to get him up and running again. Once he recovers he will go off medical hold and we'll start working on finding his perfect family! He'll need an understanding family who gets he's always going to make a mess when he eats and drinks, that he'll slobber all over the place always since his tongue is always out and he really needs a family who is home all the time or almost all the time. We've worked on his anxiety but for him to thrive he'll do best having his people with him as much as possible!\nWe'll provide an update once he's back home!\n*Update 2-15-2020*\nWe got his test results back yesterday and unfortunately two of his lumps came back as MCT's, neither of which have clean margins. One was the giant lump on his back thigh, the other was in his nubbin. I'll spare you the details but the giant one appears that it is not able to be removed without drastic measures that are not in Coleman's best interests. We do have a follow up appointment scheduled in two weeks to determine what his path forward looks like and get a second set of eyes on his test results.\nHe is doing good after the stitch fiasco and his wrist is looking better. He's going to get lots of love and spoiling over the next two weeks and then we will determine what is next for Coleman . All positive thoughts for him will be much appreciated!\n*Update 2-9-20*\nI got all a mouth lift recently, along with some lumps and bumps removed, which means I get to wear a sexy e-collar and bodysuit, but I promise my sweetness and personality were not removed with the lumps.\nI am settling into my third foster family as I struggle with Separation Anxiety and am slowly learning that my foster mom CAN leave the house and that she will return, but it's a process. I will need a plastic crate as it keeps me safe and a lot of Kongs filled with goodies.\nI can co-exist with dogs of all sizes, and boy, do I love my walkies.\nMy tongue is permanently sideways, no idea why but all the humans around me say it's from an old injury. I am the messiest eater- so highly suggest either a Neater Feeder or someone who likes to clean my mess up daily :)\nI accept donations for my surgery! Cash, PayPal or Treats, your choice!",

Foster mom thinks that's a quite fitting name for me since I'm not shy at expressing myself! I sometimes get along with other dogs when it pleases me, but because I'm picky, it would be best that I am the only dog with my human family. I'm a pretty active girl and would love an active family! I'm almost 2 years old now and really need a loving home that I can call my very own! I do like human kids and dont mind all the loving and attention... but I\u2019m also a little spunky and I might me a little much for younger kids.\n\nOur adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping and transport expenses. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset travel and medical expenses.\n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt",

He is very, very sweet and friendly and he loves to please people.\u00a0 He loves peanut butter Kongs and stuffed toys! He enjoys going on pack walks.  He's a smart boy, too!\n\n\u2022 Marvin gets along with some other dogs. He does best with dogs who aren\u2019t bossy\u2014 he likes to be the boss. If you have a dog who needs a bossy guy, you could make an appointment to bring your dog in to meet Marvin to see if they could be buddies. \n\n\u2022 We think a yard with a wooden privacy fence would be best for him.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019d be good with teenage kids, but not young kids\u2014 he\u2019s a big strong guy and a bit of a bulldozer! \n\n\u2022 He has a prey drive so he needs a home without cats.  \n\n\u2022 That said, be sure to check out the video we posted of Marvin meeting a frog! Marvin wasn't sure what to think about his new friend. (No amphibians were injured in the process!)\n\n\u2022 Marvin was picked up by KCK Animal Services as a stray. The poor guy was emaciated, the flies had bitten up his ears and he had heartworms. We transferred Marvin to our care to get him healthy. He now weighs about 60 lbs, up from 48 lbs. He loves to eat and he\u2019s very food motivated. He\u2019s actually on a diet now because he\u2019s gotten chunky! He has completed heartworm treatment and is heartworm free now.  \n\n\u2022 Marvin has been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. He\u2019s had a rough life, but he\u2019s a sweetheart and now he deserves a loving home!\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info. \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

            "description": "\nKam prefers to be in a quiet household where he can be with his human. He is not a cuddle bug but must be near his person at all times. He can get testy around food and other getting between him and his person but will back down after he lets out a warning. He is not a fan of bigger dogs. We, also think he would be better without young children and all their activities. Kam is not housebroken but tolerates belly bands. He is on a routine in his foster home and is doing well but well still have a few accidents.\n\nKam has been on Petfinders for awhile with his best friend Kip.  They came to us several years ago as strays and were adopted by a wonderful couple.  Over the years their adoptive mom passed away and their dad got to the point where he could not care for them.  So they were returned to the group as our contract says.  Recently Kip has crossed over the Rainbow Bridge when his heart could not continue.  We had planned to keep them together.  Kam misses his friend but is doing well by himself. \n\nKam is a sweet boy.  He has had a rough life before he had come to us the first time.  We are not sure what the boys went through but we have promised that their life will be wonderful from the day we received them.\n\nKam is an older dog.  We are not sure of the age but he is at least eight years old.  Something has happened to his back end so he does not wag his tail.  His back end will give way while he is walking.  He rolls his paws while he is walking.  But he gets to where he needs to go and quickly if he has to.  He is on pain medicine for  his arthritis and it seems to be under control.\n\nHe did develop an eye infection that we treated very aggressively and it was not improving.  It became clear that he was in a great deal of pain.  We had the eye removed and he has not missed it.  He feels better and is feisty like normal.\n\nKam prefers to be in a quiet household where he can be with his human.  He is not a cuddle bug but must be near his person at all times.  He can get testy around food and other getting between him and his person but will back down after he lets out a warning.  He is not a fan of bigger dogs.  We, also think he would be better without young children and all their activities.  Kam is not housebroken but tolerates belly bands.  He is on a routine in his foster home and is doing well but well still have a few accidents.\n\nKam is a special boy with his querks and he deserves a wonderful loving forever home.  If you have room in your heart for this guy let us know.\n \nIf interested in giving Kam a home, please complete an application at www.safeanimalhaven.com",

It is sensory ataxia that fits her symptoms most closely. Her back legs cause her to wobble when she walks and when she runs. But, this little dog is not held back by this disability at all. She runs and plays with other dogs and people with no issue! \nHey, what's the big deal if her bum wobbles from side to side a little bit?!\n\nSensory ataxia in dogs is linked to problems with the spinal cord, so the most common symptoms are related to loss of balance and an awkward or unbalanced gait. Some potential causes for this type of ataxia include a structural or developmental abnormality in the spinal cord, tumors of the spine, infection in the vertebrae, inflammation or trauma of the spinal cord, or a medical condition called degenerative myelopathy. Other symptoms of sensory ataxia include misplacing the feet and progressive weakness.",

Little did we know then that her issues may have been related to what we learned now to be Masticatory Muscle Myositis with possible underlying events of sporadic seizures. Bella will most likely need to be on prednisone for most of her life. A life we hope one day will find her back in a home that will  love her no matter what she looks like. Like the others currently in boarding, we pray she finds a home that will work for her. One where she can be the only fur-kid to be doted on. Bella needs a home with a secured fenced yard with privacy panels and a responsible owner as she can be animal reactive.\nShes rather small but very active and strong so an experienced handler is necessary. \n\n* In order to process only serious applicants,  please note  that all animals shown on this pet finder site have not yet been officially adopted. Inquiries asking if the animal is available will not be addressed . Requesting \"more information\" without being specific will also not be addressed. *\n\n\nDue to limited resources, we can only place Bella in the Omaha area or within a 30 mile radius",

Tori is an absolute love who is looking for a quiet and laid back home where she can go for short walks in the sun, car rides, and play with her favorite toys. Her favorite toys are tiny stuffed toys that she loves to carry around and show to her people before snuggling with them on her bed. \nShe loves her people and starts to bounce around and wiggle whenever she sees her friends coming to spend time with her. While she loves just about every person she meets, she would prefer to be an only dog so she can have all your love and affection. If you're looking for a sweet senior, Tori might just be your perfect match!",

            "description": "Sunbeams, seasonal fruits, chairs for exactly 1 (her), and long walks on secluded beaches: these are a few of Peaky\u2019s favorite things. She\u2019s the perfect COVID companion--she strongly prefers 6 feet from strangers and likes to keep the houseguests to members of the pod. Shaking hands and kissing babies may not be her jam, but if you\u2019re a Real One, Peaky\u2019s happy to lounge the day away as your sophisticated sidekick. With time, she\u2019ll start to dole out her patented Peaky Pecks (the teeniest kisses) and press herself next to you on the couch. \n\nPeaky has a great low to flexible energy level and is quite satisfied with a neighborhood meander with plenty of time budgeted for sniffing (in her opinion, if you wanted to get your heart rate up, you should go for a run). She\u2019s happy to throw in a special hike or adventure here or there--in fact, her favorite foster outing is to share a breakfast burrito and play in the waves on a quiet beach. From there, she\u2019ll happily entertain herself with a sunbeam nap, a chew on a bone, or an occasional spurt of silliness or a formidable game of tug. When you\u2019re gone, a crate full of cozy blankets is all she needs to content herself. \n\nPeaky\u2019s occasional cat-like independence seems to come from a place of being an introverted worrywart. She\u2019s been working hard in her foster home to learn new skills to lift the weight of the world off her shoulders. She considers herself a high maintenance low maintenance dog--really, all she needs is a comfy place to rest her head, share a snack, and keep up with her pesky allergies (did she mention she is quite literally allergic to people?!), and the rest of her sometimes silly, sometimes sweet, always quirky personality will reveal itself in time. \n\nCheck out more from Peaky on her Instagram at @particularly.peaky (https://www.instagram.com/particularly.peaky/)\n\nAbout 4.5 years old and 55 pounds, Peaky is crate-trained, house-trained, micro-chipped, up to date on routine vaccinations and knows her basic commands.",

They say I am lots of fun and that I love to cuddle, too. \u00a0I love car rides, tummy rubs, and an occasional bath. My favorite game is playing ball, and the rest of the time I am just happy to hang out with people.\n\nI love my walks and am learning to walk nicely without pulling, and I know some basic commands. I\u2019m housebroken and I rarely bark.\u00a0\n\nI love everyone I meet, but I have to admit that young children can make me a little nervous. I met a really cool hamster in one of my foster homes, but I still haven\u2019t figured out cats. I have gone on lots of pack walks with other dogs and participated in several large dog playgroups.\u00a0I liked some of the dogs and didn\u2019t get along with others\u2026I guess you could say that I\u2019m dog selective and would be happier if I was your one and only pup.\n\nI live in a foster home now, and I love my crate and my toys. I'm a good boy when my foster mom is at work. Sometimes she takes me to work with her and I love hanging out there, and meeting all the people!\n\nHarley is 8-years-old, neutered, microchipped and up-to-date with shots.\n\nCONTACT: (805)\u00a0445-3535\ninfo@allforloveanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Holy legs Turkey man! \n\nThis handsome fella is Turkey and is a 2 year old Hound/Shepard mix (best guess). Turkey was returned to the shelter in March of this year after he started showing signs of resource guarding. Since being at the shelter, Turkey's people have been taking every chance they get to work on \"what's mine is your's\" with him to allow him to be the very best boy! Turkey loves to run in the play yard and walks fairly well on his leash when he is being taken out by staff members. \n\nTurkey will thrive best with an active family who can provide daily runs and weekend hikes! A new family for our Turkey will also need time and patience available to devote to exercise, training and socialization. Turkey will sit for his treats, but tends to guard his food. Turkey is seeking an adult only home with no kiddos in the home or visiting the home due to guarding. He will need an owner committed to having no dog toys or high value items in the home. \n\nTurkey will need a family without feline friends or small animal critters in the house due to his high prey drive. Dog siblings will be dependent on a meet and greet basis. Following adoption, staff highly recommends waiting at least 4 weeks until working on outside of household introductions. An owner with experience with behavioral / guarding issues is highly recommended. \n\nIf interested in adopting Turkey, please visit www.lebanonhumane.org for all the details on our current adoption process.",

Everyone tells me how sweet and pretty I am, but if you've seen my pictures, you already know that!\n\nRight now, I live in a house with my foster mom and foster dad. I'm just as happy to snuggle on the couch with my people. I am very friendly and like to say hello to everyone! I get really excited and even do a dance when people come my way. I went to doggy school one time and was told I was the top student. My foster mom says I'm very smart and learn quickly!\n\nI also love toys (my favorites are Benebones!) But my favorite thing to do is spend time with my people! Car rides are great because I get to go to fun places where other people can love on me!\n\nI'm happy where I am now, but my foster family tells me about some \"forever home\" place. I'm not exactly sure what that is, but they tell me there will be at least one human there who will love me, so that's pretty cool. As long as you love me, I'll be your friend forever!\n\n- Rose will be great in a home with a very friendly dog or as an only dog.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nRose is available for adoption through Spirit Canine Rescue. To adopt Rose, please visit our website http://www.spiritcaninerescue.org/adopt.html for more information and to complete an application. A home visit will be required prior to adoption. All dogs will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption and will also be up-to-date on age-appropriate vaccinations (rabies, distemper/parvo and bordatella).\n\n* Our only obligation is to the dogs in our program and we reserve the right to determine whether a particular dog and the adopter are the right fit.Remember, just because a dog \"looks\" like the one you want, that does not necessarily mean that the dog will \"behave\" like the one you want!\n\nNote: We do not adopt out of state! Dogs must be leash walked at all times if there is no fenced in yard! We do not adopt to homes with invisible/underground fencing!",

            "description": "Noel will make your holidays merry and bright! At just 2 years old, Noel found herself and her 6 tiny puppies homeless. She was a wonderful mother and her puppies all found loving homes, so now it's her turn to find a forever home all her own. A mix of Lab and Cattle Dog, Noel is an athletic and energetic young lady. Her foster family takes her on 3 runs or walks a day, but she wouldn't complain if it was more often or for longer each time. Her forever family needs to be dedicated to getting her plenty of mental and physical stimulation each day. The world wasn't very kind to Noel in the first few years of her life, so she's nervous when meeting new people. She's working on building her confidence in her foster home and is looking for a kind and patient forever family ready to help her learn to trust again. Younger children make her nervous and we think she'd be happiest in a home with no children or only older, respectful children. She's fostered with other dogs and loves to romp and play with them in the family yard. Noel would love another dog in her forever home and she is good meeting new dogs that come over to her foster home. Noel is both house and crate trained, and she sleeps through the night on her foster parents' bed. She has just started to play with toys and is an absolute lovebug with her humans. If you are interested in giving Noel a home for a holidays, your first step is to submit an adoption application on our website. If you are already approved with a coach or have adopted from us before, reach out to your coach for the next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

Lavender would probably do best as an only pet, but may do okay with another mellow dog her size or larger. Lavender is about 50 lbs and 4-5 years old. She is spayed, current on vaccines, and on slow-kill heartworm treatment.\n\nLavender is currently being fostered in South Alabama, but we can arrange a meet and greet closer to you. Send us an email for more information.  Our adoption applications are available at www.blackcatsolddogs.org/adoption-information",

She needs a routine.\nCRATE TRAINING: GOOD, BUT PREFERS TO BE OUT AND ABOUT AND PART OF THE FAM! Eats in her crate though because blind dogs tend to be guardy with their food (from other dogs that is).\nOTHER DOGS: GREAT, LOVES OTHER DOGS, CAN PLAY A LITTLE ROUGH FOR LITTLE DOGS\nCATS: IS A CHASER SO JUST NO...\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $800 (for Lyn-Z and Dare)\nHEALTH: LYN-Z IS BLIND. She is spayed, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines. Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of this vet care as well as other incidental costs of care.\n\nHISTORY: Lyn-Z came to us from our friends in Texas. Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find Lyn-Z a great forever family!\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: LYN-Z is a wonderful girl. Blind dogs see with their heart. Or something along those lines. I think Lyn-Z heard this in a Hallmark movie or something. So she takes that to \"heart,\"\n\nShe is sweet and affectionate. Everything you could ask for in a pup. She does require another dog in the home, and has bonded for life with her BFF bulldog/pitbull mix, Dare. He's also her ESA and helps her when she gets anxious in new places. Blind dogs do best with a dog companion. She does have some separation anxiety which is why she requires another dog. You wouldn't know it until you take Dare out of the picture as she's quite content as long as he's around. And she can be a little nervous in new places. She is crate trained and sleeps in her crate at night. She can play a little rough with small dogs as she can't see their corrections. She's great with dogs of all ages and can wrestle with the puppies and sleep with the elderly. She is learning not to jump, since blind dogs see with their paws and nose, they tend to jump on people in greeting for touch and smell. Like Olaf she loves warm hugs! She will need to learn new commands such as Wall, Step, etc. as will the adopter to help her navigate the world better. She's an excellent mapper but when walking the adopter needs to teach her commands so that she won't run into walls or trip over curbs and go up or down stairs, etc.\n\nUnlike her BFF she can go to daycare where the other dogs can be monitored, as other dogs do not always appreciate blind dogs who can't see their cues. She's definitely not a dog park dog as we don't know how the other dogs will react to her and she could easily get hurt and unable to defend herself. She's a sensitive girl and the last thing you need is some bozo at the dog park hurting her feelings. Plus you can't bring Dare because he would tell that guy off and things would just go downhill from there. So no dog parks for this girl. But she's good with a fenced backyard for her to run circles in while barking at her imaginary friends (but we won't talk about that...).\n\nShe loves her people, and they are a source of comfort and affection for her. She will trust you explicitly and greets you with a hug. While she does entertain herself and take naps while you work, sometimes she will stop in for a quick hug and a kiss to reassure herself that you're there even though she can hear you clacking away at the keyboard or on your super important zoom meeting. She gives sweet kisses rather than the sloppy ones her BFF gives. With the two of them, expect many kisses. She's very tactile and touches you often, whether with her paws or body. She loves to climb in bed and snuggle with you at the end of the day and when she's done playing with the other dogs, but more of a puppy piler type then spooner.\n\nShe does love to be out and about, although hasn't learned to walk a straight line yet and looks like a drunk Lippizaner on a mission. Funny how she can't see yet feels she should be leading... She bounces off her BFF frequently while she prances down the trail but he doesn't mind. She will definitely \"see\" the rabbit before anyone else. She loves the smells that come with walking on the trails.\n\nLyn-Z is a spunky sassy girl who loves to play. She loves to be in the backyard with the sun on her face and the mud under her feet. She's can be a talker when she's nervous. As she's blind she hears a lot and isn't always a fan of dogs on the TV or youtube videos, as she will grumble and bark back at them. You talkin' to me?! She'll leave the room if you're watching a horror flick because creepy music... ch, ch, ch, ah, ah, ah!\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and Martingale collar (or a harness, if necessary), depending on each dog's particular needs.\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO:\nMotley Zoo Animal Rescue is a volunteer run, foster based, 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Redmond, WA. Motley Zoo does not have a traditional shelter location, but instead, utilizes private foster homes which care for the animals individually, in a home environment, until a \"furever\" home is found.\n\nMotley Zoo also runs \"Rock Star Treatment\" Dog Daycare & Training Studio in Redmond, WA which is a day-use facility and does not hold kennels of adoptable animals. The dogs there are owned animals who come to the facility while their families are at work and school so they can play and socialize in a safe environment. We dub this service our \"Year-round\" fundraising program which helps us support our rescue animals and the $15,000/ month vet bills we incur. This Studio location does have an Adoptable Cat Lounge, where cats may live until adoption, which is the exception to any aforementioned rules.\n\nPlease email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application so we can get you started on the journey to finding a new, furry friend! Once you have been approved to adopt, then we can set up a meeting with the animal you have been matched with.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a dog in need!\n\nWoof,\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

            "description": "6/10/2020 On the verge of Sebastian's 1 yr birthday we want to update. Sebastian spent a little while in a foster to adopt situation. Everything was great until the foster mom started taking her small kids into the front yard to play while leaving Sebastian in the back yard alone. He started jumping the fence to be in the front yard with the family. Then when the family would put him outside alone he began jumping the fence and going to the front door so the adoption did not work out because the safety of Sebastian is our priority. Sebastian is a playful affectionate guy but he is timid in the beginning. He has separation anxiety and needs a companion and a home where he will be indoors when the family is at work. \n\n12/23/19 Update: Little Sebastian has made strides in the last few weeks. He is learning to be with other dogs, walk on a leash, his potty training is going well. He is a very snuggly, playful dog. \n\nStarted the morning out trying to save a 6 month old German Shepherd boy with a broken leg from the local kill shelter. He had been hit by a car, animal control took him to vet. Owner was contacted but she never went to pick him up so he was taken to the kill shelter where he sat in a crate. He has demodectic mange so we are treating that too and will take him back next to to check leg again and get him neutered then he can get stitches and cast off at same time.\n\nHe's not socialized so we'll be working on that, house manners and basic obedience!!  \n\nHe has 2 more weeks in the cast and then if all goes well he will be official available for adoption. 12/1/19",

Mommas has a strong prey drive towards non-dog animals, so a home with no other species is a must. \n\nMomma also requires a slow introduction to new people, ESPECIALLY MEN! - we believe as she continues her training her loving nature will shine through to include all people but right now she is still too inexperienced with having positive interactions with new people.\n\nMomma is crate and house trained, and walks well on a leash!\n\nMomma had a rough start and some traumatic experiences that no dog should ever have to go through. \n\nShe needs the PERFECT home with breed experience and someone willing to go the extra mile to let her Awesomeness shine through!!!!",

DOB 10-30-15), male, 51 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Shelter staff said Lucas loves belly rubs! Lucas loves to run, play with his ball (as in the video), and is a very happy bubbly boy! He came into the shelter in bad shape; very emaciated as you can see from the pictures below. Although at the shelter Lucas met a similar large female terrier and did fine. He was very energetic, but showed no sign of reactions towards her. However he did not do well with another male that he met at boarding. Lucas will do best in a home without other dogs, in a rural setting, and with an experienced family. From his VT Foster family: Lucas is good with dog friends with proper introduction; doesn't like cats, but loves humans of all ages (does very well with children.....and horses!). He is crate trained, potty trained and has no sign of separation anxiety. Lucas loves his walks/hikes and does well on leash, still a bit afraid of loud traffic but working on his confidence. He knows some basic commands such as Sit, Off and Leave It. Lucas is very sweet and loving; very easy going. Stay tuned for more information as Lucas is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lucas please fill out an Application at\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Apollo is also missing his spleen because he had a benign tumor which needed removal, and since the tumor was wrapped around his spleen our vet had to take his spleen to remove the tumor.  Recently Apollo had a growth removed from his toe which turned out to be a low-grade Mast Cell Cancer.  Apollo needs a safe fenced yard because he cannot be walked on a leash and collar, due his laryngeal paralysis.  If he is pulled too hard he will actually lose air and pass out.  Apollo he can be managed on a harness, but even that causes him discomfort.   Apollo is fully vetted including a full dental and blood work up.  He doesn't appear to have any issues with other dogs, but we are seeking an only pet home for Apollo because he has been at our shelter for more than a year now and he will need time to decompress.  ??",

Coolidge is good in a house. He didn't even bother the Christmas tree.....Coolidge has been waiting behind bars for 433 days.  We are seeking an adult dog savvy home without other pets.  Coolidge did walk calmly past other dogs on his walk today and Coolidge comes with free obedience training and he has a sponsor so he is no charge to the perfect family.  Apply hartshelter.org or call 217.283.0779. HART Rescue, Hoopeston, IL.\n\nHey folks my name is Coolidge and I need a home! I am a goofy fellow, I walk decent on a leash, and I sit and shake hands for treats too. I like to smile in hopes of landing a family of my own but I was a stray so nobody is sure if I have house manners, but I am pretty clean inside my kennel. I try to be a good boy but I am stressed and become too excited around the other dogs, so maybe I should be the only pet. The veterinarian guessed me at four years old but I chase a ball like a pup. Oh and my back legs are cow hocked, but I have no idea why. My adoption fee is $185.00 and I am fully vetted. Apply hartshelter.org or call 217.283.0779.",

I am loving, smart and happy. Because I am young, strong, possessive about my toys and possibly food and enthusiastic about life, I need an adult home without children, who are able to follow instructions for my care. You will have to work diligently on the toy and food possession on a daily basis. If you can provide a cat-free home, small dog-free, provide prescription diet food, love, exercise, and a fenced yard, then you may be just what I am looking for and I may be just what you are looking for. Let's get together and discuss our future life. I am open to possibilities and hope you will consider me to be your forever best friend.\n\nBully Breed Experience Required:\nPlease note, that Goose requires multiple visits with some intensive training to determine if a home visit is possible. Goose appreciates your understanding and patience.\n\nIf you have further questions, emails are the only method of communication at this time. We all care about the health of our 2-legged caregivers and the community at large, so as a precaution we are temporarily suspending our public open hours. We are still taking email inquiries and applications, and will be in touch with you as soon as we are able. We appreciate everyone\u2019s understanding during this difficult time!

            "description": "This girl is around 5 years old and about 60 lbs. Samantha has an amazing rescue story, she was living and surviving all on her own behind the abandoned Jack in the Box for almost 3 YEARS, she was so afraid and living in survival mode. But we never gave up and after years of feeding her she finally succumbed to allowing herself be touched. Samantha has done awesome in her foster home. She loves ALL dogs and she has a very submissive attitude. She would probably be most comfortable in a home with older kids or no kids. Samantha is great in a crate and she regards her crate as her safe place. She loves to snuggle on the bed and adapts very well when she has a routine to follow. Samantha would love a happily ever after, she is up to date on all shots and preventative, spayed and ready for a home. Her adoption fee is only $95, please let us know if you would like to be part of real rescues life.\nOur Samantha has been with us over a year. On June 21st, 2019 after months of tirelessly trying to catch her. We finally did! She is shy but wants someone to love her and give her a forever home for her remaining years. She needs a home that understands the trauma she\u2019s endured. She needs someone to show her that it\u2019s okay to trust humans. She loves other dogs but would probably prefer a home without small children due to her shyness. *see this sweet dolls current glamour shots and past photos from how she was living on her own before Rufus Refuge found her*\nFrom June 21, 2019. After being on her own and living out behind the abandoned \u2018jack in the box\u2019 for almost 3 years- she is now safe.  Samatha wanted badly to trust- she was just too afraid. we will never know how she got out there but obviously a very smart girl to survive on her own that long.  \nAfter several hours of talking to her, she finally surrendered to being touched. She decided maybe \u201call\u201d humans aren\u2019t so bad.\nIt\u2019s been a long hard road for Samantha - she will need some down time to just chill and get used to her new human interaction. She is so sweet and is going to make somebody a fabulous companion!!",

He follows me all over the house. He located his food and water bowls, and now he is doing great! I don't let him sleep on the bed because I'm afraid he will fall off. He sleeps on a bed next to mine and gets along fine with the other pugs in my home. He has to be taken outside regularly. He would be a great addition to a home without small children or big dogs. He is a wonderful little companion, and he is quiet. The ideal home for him would be with someone that is home a lot and has time to love on him. Mochi is a lap dog that needs someone to love him during his golden years. He has plenty of love to give in return!\n",

She does like to sunbathe outside though! She will bark and growl if she's scared or uncomfortable, and she loves attention but gets a bit overwhelmed if she's hugged too much.June would do best as the only dog in the house.",

I was living in a home for several years but because of their health, they could no longer care for me.  I have now been rehomed to Michigan in a wonderful foster home.  I do not get on furniture or beds.  I sleep on my comfy dog beds.  I need rugs to walk on wood floors.  I can not live with small dogs and cats, but I do live with 1 other greyhound and 2 pitties.  I love to talk.  I get a little noisy when you come home from work/shopping.  I get so excited that I run and grab my bed and want to drag it around.  I am a very quiet boy until you get on the phone.  Then I want to talk along with you.  I use my talking roo voice.  I am very well behaved.  I am pretty much potty trained.  I can hold it about 5-6 hrs, if it is longer than that, I might have an accident.  I try my best.  I wake you up about 4 - 5am to tell you I need to go outside and go potty.  I eat 2 times a day.  I ride well in the car.  I sometimes need help getting into the truck.  I only do a few stairs going in and out of the house.  I can probably learn them easily though.  I am not a cuddly dog, I am very aloof and I don\u2019t get in your way.  Are you the perfect home for me.  I would love to meet someone that would accept me as I am.  I will be your loyal best friend. \n\nGreyhound Expressions\ngreytluv@gmail.com\n\nI love my hounds\n \n\n\n",

King wasn't well socialized so being dumped at animal control was stressful for him however the shelter staff worked hard with him to build trust and made good progress. The shelter was affected by Tropical Storm Imelda and they were out of room for them both. King also needed more one on one so they reached out to us to help him and we are happy to do so. King is described as being laid back and generally calm, loud noises are a little scary for him. King's foster family will be working with this guy to help him learn about living indoors, basic commands and working on building his confidence and positive socialization. We can't wait to see this guy blossom and he's already relaxing and decompressing and we can update his bio once we get to know him a little more.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Stripes wasn't well socialized so being dumped at animal control was stressful for him however the shelter staff worked hard with him to build trust and made good progress. The shelter was affected by Tropical Storm Imelda and they were out of room and space. Stripes also needed more one on one so they reached out to us to help him and we are happy to do so. Stripes is described as being laid back and generally calm, loud noises are a little scary for him and he does have cherry eye that will we will be having fixed. Stripes' foster family will be working with this guy to help him learn about living indoors, basic commands and working on building his confidence and positive socialization. We can't wait to see this guy blossom and he's already relaxing and decompressing and we can update his bio once we get to know him a little more.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI!

            "description": "** We ask that our potential adopters fill out an adopt application on our dogs first . No one is obligated by doing so but it is a first good step to see if they are a match. Our application can be found on our website www.jcldr.com\n\nVERNON BRITISH COLUMBIA: Meet Boomer is a 9-year-old Catahoula /Treeing Walker/Bluetick Coonhound mix.. He is approximately 65 lbs at healthy weight, and he is neutered, HW negative (there is no heartworm where he lives, so he is not on preventative), up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped. He is crate trained and very well housetrained, although he does mark outside like many male dogs. He has had a full dental cleaning and problem teeth extracted. Although he is still very active, Boomer is a senior working dog, and thus can overdo it and get a bit sore\u2013this is easily managed, however, by making sure Boomer does not jump up or down from high places (like trucks), using a harness to walk him, and giving him age-appropriate supplements like glucosamine. Otherwise, he is in great shape for a large dog of his age and does not require medication.\n\nHISTORY: Boomer came to us from a shelter in Idaho, where he was taken in as a stray along with a young pitbull he had been running the woods with for three weeks. The shelter posted him as a found dog, and were then notified by a woman who recognized the dog as belonging to her uncle, who had passed. The owner\u2019s son had taken the dogs, but moved away and left them in the woods to fend for themselves. No other family members wanted the dogs, so Boomer spent six weeks at the shelter before we picked him up, passed over while his younger companion was adopted. It is clear that Boomer was a both a house pet and a hunting hound in his former life, and he is very happy to be in a warm, comfortable home again.\n\nGOOD: Boomer is a wonderful dog, and quite ready to be a beloved pet. He gets along extremely well with medium and large size dogs of all kinds, and is gentle and affectionate with people. He does OK with small dogs as well, but can get a little overexcited with them. He backs off quickly if they get testy with him, however. He is very playful and is especially fond of balls and squeaky plush toys, which he throws and pounces on with vigor. He has plenty of pep and life left in him and can easily hike for an hour or two (on-leash only, see below), after which he snoozes soundly like the older dog he is. His tail is usually wagging, and he leans against his people gently to ask for pets and ear rubs. He greets strangers politely and with a wagging tail, also, even if they approach the vehicle he is in. He makes friends everywhere he goes with his handsome looks, soulful eyes, wagging tail and gentle temperament! Although many of our dogs in rescue do not make good dog park candidates, Boomer loves the *securely and fully fenced* dog park! He runs and plays with other dogs, gets pets from strangers, and makes everyone laugh with his baying. He would love to have another active, playful dog in his forever home to romp with! He is mostly calm and quiet at home, unless he wants to play, if he wants his dinner, or if another dog starts barking, in which case he will sing you a coonhound song. He is very responsive to verbal correction in the house, and learns quickly, though he does test his limits. He is docile being handled and lifted, and does not exhibit resource guarding behavior with humans or other dogs. Because he is highly food motivated, however, he can get a bit pushy getting into a smaller dog\u2019s food dish (though still no growling or snapping), so he is fed in his crate while other dogs finish their meals. Boomer does fine at the vet and rides well in a car. He knows some basic commands (like sit, stay, and lay down), and he is eager to learn more for treats. With his food and toy motivation, coupled with his incredible hound nose, he would likely make an excellent trainee for competitive nosework, and his foster home has started him on scent tracking activities.\n\nBAD: Boomer is a hound through and through, and we believe he was trained to hunt bears or cougars at one point. This means when he is out walking, his nose is to the ground, and if he catches a scent that interests him, he will pull and lunge to follow it with extreme focus. We are working on his leash manners, but he would not yet be a good fit for an adopter who is unsteady on his/her feet or lacks resistance strength. He is a large, strong, lean dog even at his age. When he catches bear/cougar scent especially, he bays and tries to take off after it. For this reason and because his recall is at this point unreliable, he will likely not be a good candidate for off-leash adventures and certainly cannot be left to roam in a fence-free yard. (Because of his age, a 5-foot wooden fence is fine. We are unsure if he would climb a chain-link.) With time and patience, we believe he can have nice leash manners, especially in a more suburban setting. His foster family is working hard on recall, leash manners, and redirecting his scent skills to a more appropriate activity for an older pet (like nosework). Also, he absolutely cannot be in a home with cats or other small animals \u2013 as a trained hunting hound, it is likely he will seriously injure or kill them. This is not a flaw, but exactly what he was bred and trained for. As mentioned above, he is kind and gentle with humans and other dogs\u2026 he is in no way a dangerous or mean dog. He is just a typical hunting hound with high prey drive. He also will follow his nose into trouble with counter-pillaging or trash-raiding when unsupervised, though he can\u2019t jump fully up on a countertop (thankfully). His foster family is working to correct these behaviors and on obedience\u2026 in the meantime, he is crated when left home alone for safety.\n\nUGLY: There is nothing ugly about Boomer. He is a sweet, loving, charming and intelligent dog ready for his retirement home.",

She loves running and romping with other dogs in our fenced exercise areas.  She never meets a stranger and enjoys going for leash walks with our volunteers.\n\nZion will make a great new family member with the family that promises to love and care for her always!\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

Coco here!  \nI\u2019m a real happy go lucky guy, a class clown if you will, but spending this much time in a loud shelter can be a bit stressful, as you can imagine. I would really love a home of my own where I could decompress. \n\nMy favorite thing in the whole world is TOYS. I love toys, so much so that I ingest the pieces sometimes, and can guard them from my people. My shelter family makes sure I only get the real hardy toys that I can\u2019t destroy and puts them up when they are interacting with me. I\u2019m a strong boy, and my friends here at MLAR are teaching me manners and how to be the best dog I can be for my future family. Do you think you could continue my training in your home? \n\nI am anxious around new people so I must be introduced slowly and carefully. That will need to be done for every new person in my circle of friends and family. I also am very strong and get too excited over other dogs so I will need to go home as an only pet. I'm a funny guy who loves spending time outside in the play yards and entertaining my friends. If you'd like more information on me please fill out an application and our behavior manager will get back to you with more details.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

I am very pretty and silly, and I do the cutest wiggle when I get excited! I love to play with all kinds of toys, and love to play in the snow.

The girls sure didn't have a great home in the past, and came to us in horrid condition when they were found together as strays.  They're both around 8 years old and were skin and bones and covered in dirt when they came in.  They spent time under medical care and it was discovered that Zeka (mostly gray face) had some mammary masses. They were removed but unfortunately, one of them was malignant, so that will always need to be watched in the future.  Zeka also has some facial paralysis on one side but she doesn't let any of this stop her from being the biggest mush you've ever met. Her and Zuri both are incredibly sweet, loving, happy, well-behaved girls. Zuri is more playful and active, but they are both such fun, lovable girls. They will need a home with no other pets but they sure love each other. Zeka and Zuri hope you'll give them a chance!  File#29182/83 9/19/19\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Zeka and Zuri.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

Once I get a treat and some pets, my tail immediately starts wagging and I come back for more! It doesn't take me long at all to realize how awesome it is to be loved!\n\nI don\u2019t remember my previous life, but I don\u2019t think I got much attention since I don\u2019t immediately seek it out. All I need is someone to love me whom I can love back. I\u2019ll be by your side and be your best friend forever!\n\nI am super gentle when I take treats, I\u2019m not jumpy or bark-y and would do great in a home with other dogs or kids. I got the chance to have a \"meet-n-greet\" with some lovely people and their dog. The doggie and I met and we had no problems deciding we were just fine with one another. After a minute or two of some quality attention with the humans, I was up giving them hugs and kisses. It was so nice! They also met a furry friend of mine and she got the grand prize for the day. It was a hard decision for them to make, but I know the right family will come along and pick me. (I am super happy for her, by the way.)\n\nSo if you have a spot in your home and heart for a sweet gal who could use some love, please come on out and meet me! You can contact the shelter at 972-382-3647 or email adoptionsmoh@gmail.com\n\nI will be fully vetted before going to my new home.",

She came to The LAP on November 26, 2019 from the RCACP.\nWe was adopted in February and returned to the shelter on March 27, 2020.  She was doing some chewing of items in the house and having potty accidents.  Needed is someone that will be able to work with the housetraining and chewing to have a happy non-destructive family pet.  This dog is not meant to live in an apartment or a townhouse.  A fenced yard is a MUST and another dog for company is suggested.   A home without children would be best for this sweet girl.\n\nSweet Potato is sponsored by:  Kathy Lane",

She was in horrible condition and unable to use her back legs, which were rigid and unable to support her. Despite her condition, Ramona won the hearts of staff. We knew we had a wheelchair that would fit her (she doesn't need it anymore!), so we arranged for transport to Dallas and Ramona started her journey to wellness.\n\nDespite her grim prognosis, with consistent care, treatment for her heartworm disease and rehabilitation, Ramona is the happy girl you see now. She's 100% housebroken and has her own room in the founder's home. She's now completely mobile, walks on her own and loves exploring outdoors. Ramona seems to prefer people to other dogs and can be too assertive to submissive dogs. She listens well and does what she's told. She can't be allowed on furniture or anything with height where she could jump down, as her rear end still walks by committee some days. She'll make an awesome companion for the right household; all she needs is that chance.",

To look at her now it's hard to imagine how bad she was. \n\nDespite feeling so miserable AND hungry Frannie was always cheerful and eager to please....and to eat. We've introduced her to other dogs her size, both male and female and she gets along great with everyone and easily engages them in play. Her completion of obedience training has improved her confidence and her focus. Frannie will make a great companion to any household with another active dog equal to her energy level.",

Treats are a popular item too and would be recommended as a reward for chillin' and cuddling on the couch after expending his energy. He is housebroken, only has accidents when not given a routine. He's a clumsy boy who will engage his eagerness to learn. He'll make an awesome companion for an active family with a nice sized backyard and maybe a playmate equal to his energy level. Nice's fave tricks are jumping through a hula hoop, shake and sit!",

He does great with other dogs in our kennel and loves to play; in fact, Willie is a dog's dog and missed that camaraderie when he going through heartworm treatment and couldn't run and play like he wanted to. Willie wants to go explore the yard but then he wants to come and be wherever you are - ready to watch the next good movie on Netflex and cuddle on the couch. His new home cannot have cats however.

Thanks to the help of a last minute foster family we saved Sara and quickly determined she was pregnant! Sara's foster family is now her forever home, but Morpheus is still waiting for his.\n\nMorpheus is a gregarious personality in our kennel who loves playing with his sister, Aphrodite, as well as any other dog he meets. He's been on a single home visit and was paralyzed with anxiety at the change in his environment, never having been out of our kennel except to go to adoptions. The potential adopter loved him and wanted to nurture him through that stage, but it was having a negative effect on their senior dog who couldn't relax in the face of Morpheus' anxiety, so he was returned. They stated \"He really seeks your affection and he thrives on that attention\". So we're looking for someone who can give him some time to relax and feel like he's home. Morpheus will cuddle with a tiny Chihuahua or his sister Aphrodite, he doesn't discriminate on size and would enjoy a canine companion. He graduated from obedience training April 14th 2017 and was a star pupil in his class.",

He does fine with most dogs, but will not do well with an alpha. His BFF Jax, let Owen be in charge and he preferred that arrangement. He cannot be in a home with cats or small dogs.\n\nOwen was adopted from us in 2015 and we never heard a single complaint about him. In 2019 however, we received a call from the Mesquite Animal Shelter that he'd been turned in there by his adopters as \"unable to care for. This is strictly prohibited by our adoption agreement which states ALL adopted pets are returned to us. Once we saw him, we knew why; he was skin and bone, almost 35 pounds underweight, horrible skin condition and heartworm positive. He was turned in with another dog belonging to the family in the same condition and it took months to get them both well enough again to find new homes. Owen is 100% recovered from that treatment and ready for adoption. Owen loves kids and being a family member, he just needs that chance again.",

Rather than surrender her to a kill shelter, the owner reached out to us to find her a new home without these elements she didn't meld with.\n\nLosing the only home and family you've ever known is difficult for some dogs and can cause insecurity and a tendency not to trust; this is Addie. She takes time to warm up and get to know you, but when she's reassured of your intent, she's loving, happy and energetic. We'd like to find a mature, cat free/no small children household who'll give Addie time to adjust and become the loving companion she wants to be. Addie has completed basic obedience training and did well in her class; she's eager to please and wants to learn. Her new home should continue that structure as it gives her confidence.",

He does best with female dogs and cannot be in a home with cats or small dogs. Boudreaux is an active dog, but he wants to be where his people are; so leaving him in a backyard without you is not his idea of a good time. He's very quick to learn, is crate trained and appears to be housebroken. Boudreaux would make a great companion for an active person looking for a running companion. He's also completed basic obedience training!",

She was limping and they feared she'd already been hit. A transporter brought her to us the next day.\n\nA little timid at first, Callie takes some convincing that you're not another risk she must avoid. Her limping turned out to be a piercing bite, literally through her hip and into her tummy area which required immediate medical attention, but healed nicely. She enjoys going out and playing with her doggie group. Still not a real gregarious personality, Callie wants to make sure of your intent before trusting you completely. Callie will blossom in a home with another doggie friend and someone to train her on how to be their companion.",

He has been meeting with a trainer to perfect his leash skills. He's doing fantastic! Oliver has the most adorable, stubby little bowed legs. They only add to his equally adorable personality. He is crate trained and we believe he is likely house trained as well. Oliver will make a wonderful companion for an active household with a nice sized back yard.",

They were all shy from living in an outside pen with little to no socialization with people but Juneau is the shyest and the only one left of the litter that has not found a home to call her very own.  :(  \n\nJuneau takes time to warm up but once she is comfortable in a home, she is very sweet, loving and very well behaved.  She loves other dogs, is crate trained and potty trained.  Juneau is not a social butterfly and cannot be expected to travel, or be around a lot of people.  Juneau is a home body and comfortable just staying put where she knows she is safe and everything is familiar.  \n\nIf you have a heart for the shy dogs and are willing to give this girl a chance, we offer a foster to adopt program to give her time to adjust and settle in and be sure she bonds with her new family.\n\nFun Facts:\n\nAge (best guess) - 1.5 years\nBreed (best guess) - Houndy\nCurrent Weight - 32 lbs\nDog Friendly - Yes\nCat Friendly - Unknown\nKid Friendly - Depends\nPotty Trained - Yes\nCrate Trained - Yes\nLeash Trained - Yes\n\nAll of our adult dogs are current on vaccinations, de-wormed, heart worm tested, spayed/neutered, on monthly preventatives & micro chipped prior to adoption. \n\n*Adoption Fee is $200.00, No out of State Adoptions ,Virtual Home Visits \n Required  \n\n*We do not require fenced yards for all dogs, fenced yards are required based on a dogs needs. *No invisible fences.\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please fill out an adoption application at www.unchainedmelodies.org/adopt/\n\nThank you for adopting!\n\n",

The longer you know Loretta, the more she'll be open to getting pet and even give kisses when she's really happy. \nLoretta likes to go on shorter walks and prefers to take her time so she can really sniff and explore everything! She also enjoys golf cart rides and car rides where she can stick her nose out the window to catch all the passing smells. \nLoretta does need to be the only pet in your home. She is part of our Single Pets* program! That means that she is eligible for a waived adoption fee! \n*Single Pets do best as the only dog or cat in the home.",

He is an adorable guy who is in search of his forever home! \n\n\nDexter loves to play fetch with sticks or balls, he enjoys going on car rides (especially when he can stick his nose into the fresh air!), and he LOVES treats. \n\nA home with a fenced yard would be ideal, as that allows Dexter to get in some serious ball playing time, which he loves!\n\nDexter has been known to do ok with other calm, well behaved dogs, but it is unknown how he would do with other high energy dogs. Dexter has been around cats and has been curious, but respectful of them. If going to a home with another pet, Dexter would need to be fed separately from other furry friends as he prefers to dine alone. \n\nDexter is currently in training working on his leash manners when encountering other dogs, and being able to calm as he can be quick to arouse. His adopter will need to be committed to working on these issues, be patient and give him time to settle into his new environment as he has experienced many transitions recently. Dexter would benefit from a structured routine\n\nWe adore this sweet guy, and would love for him to find his forever home. He really is quite sweet- he is a young guy who will thrive in an experienced home where he can get lots of exercise.  Please consider meeting this boy- he is a gorgeous guy, loves people and we would love for him to find his forever home! Please email Janet at astrosped@yahoo.com for more information.",

He was once known as \" The Passaic River Stray,\" as he lived a lonely life on the streets of Passaic for over a year. All of that changed when we saw his photo online, and worked with a professional trapper to finally bring Gregory to safety.\nOnce in his foster home, we discovered that Gregory has a goofy, lovey personality with those he loves and trusts. He is understandably shy with strangers and new situations, but warms up quickly once he knows you're a friend. We will continue to work with Gregory to build his confidence, and socialize him with new people.\nIt is a miracle that Gregory survived for so long on his own. Our wish for Gregory is that he will find a loving, understanding home who will keep him safe and secure, and continue to teach him that he no longer needs to look over his shoulder and be afraid.\nGregory is crate trained, house trained, and walks nicely on a leash.\n\n \nAre you ready to take long walks with this beautiful boy? Submit your application here: https://www.hharteam.org/adoption-form/\nGregory's adoption fee is $200 to a qualified adopter.",

She was surrendered due to changes in her family.\n\nTess is a beautiful fawn female, about 9-11 years old and owner surrendered when her family could no longer take care of her and her fur siblings. We can truly say Tess picks her human and becomes obsessed with them. She has picked her foster daddy lol. She pines for him when he is not in her line of vision. Her previous owners thought she was paralyzed and carried her around but Tessy walks just fine, especially if Foster Daddy leaves the room, Tessy gets up to follow him. She has either IVDD or DM. Fortunately she is continent of urine and stool and we take her out for frequent potty breaks. Unfortunately, due to being a spinal dog, she has chronic UTI's. She likes toys, sleeping in the big bed next to her person and head scratches. She will defend her food from the other pugs if they get too close, barks at the younger dogs when they get too rowdy and can get quite feisty. She is a special needs pug so probably will not get adopted. But that's ok, we will enjoy her for as long as needed.\n",

He loves the grass, rolling in the grass, smelling the grass, well you get the idea. He's also a big fan of tennis balls. Does he love them as much as grass? We will let you be the judge! \n\nSnoop was in a shelter for years and eagerly awaits his forever home. He is dog friendly and enjoys meeting people. After spending his adult life behind bars, he's ready for retirement and his golden years to be with a loving human or family. Yes, his name is Snoop and he is a dog. \n\nIf interested in adopting or fostering, email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com.

She loves to cuddle people and gets along well with the other dogs, although she makes sure they know a toy or treat is hers if anyone gets too close. Her favorite way to spend the day is sleeping spread out on the big dog bed and snoring away! She is about 8 years old and heartworm negative. She has some spondylosis which makes her back legs stiff when she first gets up and moving, but she is surprisingly speedy once she gets going so don't let the funny gait fool you! She is fully house trained and crates happily.",

            "description": "Roc Man was dropped on the door step late one night of a small town Humane Association in Alabama. This Pitbull boy has been at the shelter for a couple of years now. This small town Humane Association is so clean and well run and very 'humane' and loving to their dogs. They don't give up on them even if it is years that they stay. We know there is someone out there for Roc Man. Just look at this big guy who loves the GIRLS! But we will say he is not a dog that likes to compete with other boy dogs. This stud muffin (who is neutered) is around 6 years old and weighs around 85 lb. When he came to the shelter he was heart worm positive but has been treated him and he is negative and on prevention. Roc Man has had everything done is fully vetted and micro chipped. Roc is a strong guy, typical of the bully breed. In his younger days, Roc was quite a ruff player. Thankfully, we have noticed as he has matured, his playtime is a little more mellow and more respectful of the furniture...lol. Roc proudly shows off his blue ribbon that he won at the Huntsville HOTC Dog Fair for winning \"Most Handsome\"! We think so too! Please email us if you are interested in this boy! We can transport him northward if you want to adopt him. Please email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com",

            "description": "Hello my name is Keesha! I am currently part of a loving family of 2 adult humans, a human foster brother and a doggie brother. I am very shy when you meet me but after a couple of days I warm up to people and love cuddles, belly rubs, and attention.  Sometimes I become a 75+ pound lapdog. \n\nI'm nervous around new people and new experiences, but I warm up after a while.  Not in a bad way, I just get scared and try to walk away or if I see a new person in the driveway I will bark at them to scare them away!  I have not been exposed recently to small children, but I love my teen neighbors next door and meet them at the door when they come over (but my brother gets a little jealous).\n\nI love rabbits and squirrels because they are probably very tasty, I don't know for sure because my family doesn't let me have them, but when I see them I try really hard to get them.\n\nI love playing fetch with balls and sticks and my other toys.  I also love playing tug with my brother and going for walks, with or without my brother, but I pull on the leash. My family and I are working on that though.\n\nI have been doing well with my brother, however I need to be properly introduced to new dogs.  My foster parents waited about a week to decompress me before I met my brother without a barrier.  I just finished up my heartworm treatment at the end of December 2019 and hopefully I will be heartworm free when I am retested in June. \n\nOverall, I am a fun loving dog that would make a good companion.  I am fairly low maintenance and I believe I would be adaptable to any family environment.",

            "description": "Bentley is a special boy who needs a special family to love him and take exceptional care of him. He is a lovable goofball and has retained a puppy like demeaner. He loves everyone and everyone who meets him seems to fall in love with him as well. He gets very excited when he meets new people and wants to jump up on them to give hugs and kisses and to receive even more love. Due to this, initially care needs to be taken around children and elderly, as he hasn\u2019t figured out his size. His foster mom has worked with him and he\u2019s improved, learning some self-control until his puppyish qualities get the best of him. He loves playing (albeit roughly) with his foster mom\u2019s cat (who loves rough play) and she usually finds them sleeping next to each other on his bed. He just wants to play whenever he meets another dog although he can be a bit much for the other dog until they get to know each other. When he met a young rottweiler of about 7 months who was more rambunctious than he is, it seemed to scare him some as he seemed to want to back away and avoid the pup. Basically though, this boy loves everyone and everything he encounters.\n\nHis foster mom has noticed that he shows way too much interested in running after vehicles. It seems that the larger the vehicle, the more interest he shows. He definitely needs a solidly build fenced in yard so that he can get his energy out but more importantly to keep him safe from his own curiosities. His foster mom has worked with teaching him to restrain himself whenever a vehicle drives past but he would not be a good candidate to be unleashed in an open yard.\n\nBentley knows basic commands such as: sit, down, stay, drop it, leave it, wait, place. He needs further work on these though as he has difficulty staying still for too long. His foster mom uses \u2018leave it\u2019 at each meal before giving him the ok to eat and he\u2019s really good at it, although he may try to sneak in a piece if the command is given right away. He also has not shown any food aggression. He has given the cat a warning growl from time to time but then allows the cat to lick his bowl clean. His foster mom can walk right past him as he eats, touching him in the process without any reaction from him.\n\nBentley came to SSRR very skinny with some bad stomach problems and had a long history of vomiting as he couldn\u2019t keep his food down. It has been a long, roller coaster journey to get this boy back to health and at a healthy weight. He needs to be kept on a strict raw diet and stay on his medicine to keep him healthy. His diet consists of a variety raw chicken legs and thighs, ground beef, frozen fish (1x a week), steamed sweet potatoes, steamed broccoli, steamed green beans, cottage cheese, and a raw egg (1x a day). His foster mom notes that she has noticed that he absolutely needs to have sweet potatoes every day otherwise his stomach will get upset and he may vomit. She also notes that he prefers them steamed, not willing to eat them raw. Since he\u2019s had such a rough time with his health, he has an absolute love for food and is also a gulper. With this in mind, his foster mom will not give him chicken wings and ensures she\u2019s always right there when he eats any food with bone in it. Everyone must also be sure to be educated not to feed him anything outside of his normal diet as his system is sensitive.\n\nBentley needs someone special who is dedicated to keep him on a raw diet, meal prep for him, keep him on his medicine and give him all the love and attention this dear boy needs.",

Her foster home has had many new dogs come and go and she has been excellent with all of them.  \n\nCleo is extremely affectionate and she loves to snuggle. She loves to play with other dogs and run around the yard. She currently lives with 3 other dogs and does well with all of them.  Cleo loves kids and other dogs but does not do well with cats. She is excellent with the foster puppies in her home and loves to take care of them. \n\nHer ideal home would have a 6ft fence and another dog for her to play with.  She just really enjoys playtime with her dog friends so we want to make sure she has a friend in her forever home.  \n\nCleo is crate, leash, and house trained.   Her fosters really think she is quite perfect.  \n\nCleo is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting her, please fill out an application at FYDRadopt.com and contact us at ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com",

            "description": "Whistler is a very special guy looking for a very special home. He is a typical hound when it comes to sniffing and baying. He loves to use his nose and then tell everyone about it! Whistler is thought to have cerebellar disease which basically means he is missing part of his brain, because of this he often shows some repetitive behaviors. \nWhistler has done great at the sanctuary with a structured routine and relationship building with his caregivers. He can be a sensitive boy and things like loud noises, stormy weather, and constant change can throw him off. He lives with other dogs but prefers to coexist as opposed to constantly play. He really enjoys canine company. He knows how to use his dog door, and it may help in a new home to have a similar set-up to help him with routine. \nWhistler loves walks and cookies and is a good learner with some patience (and cookies). He is also very affectionate and sweet once he knows and trusts you. He loves to bury his soft fur under your arm or weave between your legs for affection. If you're interested in meeting Whistler we ask that you spend some time with him at the sanctuary to make sure it's a good fit. Whistler is a caregiver favorite and his friends would like nothing more than to see him happy in his perfect home.",

His most favorite place to go is to Tara's Run, where agility is held. Although he has not officially done the agility course, he does love to jump up on all of the equipment. Ron is a shy dog, so this is a huge accomplishment for him!\n\nWe believe Ron would benefit greatly from having another dog in the home as he is very shy and learning how to be social with people. A dog that could help him feel more comfortable and show him the ropes would be beneficial. He will require an understanding home that is okay with Ron not wanting to be physically handled by people and without cats. Once Ron is comfortable with you, he will approach and take treats. He has even started sitting for his treats now! Due to his shyness, we recommend an adult only home.",

He can be a little careful, at first, but warms quickly!  Indio needs a home where he will be the only dog, with no small children.  He enjoys his walks, loves to play fetch, knows how to \"sit\" and enjoys affection.  Indio has a strong prey drive, and will chase/hunt wildlife, so he needs a secure yard where he won't get into trouble!  He was adopted for a few days, but they area wildlife on the acreage was too tempting, and Indio is back at Del Norte Animal Control, still looking for the perfect home for him.  Come check out Indio and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nPlease call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.

CLASP pay for vet bills, reimburse for foster costs, provide a crate and supplies as well as have dog food delivered to your door by Chewys\n\nDiamond 2 year old, fawn color, Staffordshire Terrier Dog\nRequirements: home owner, 6 ft privacy fence, no small children. \n\nDiamond is a very people-oriented girl. She never runs out of kisses and snuggles. She is also very smart! In training, she picks up on training cues quickly and is very tuned in. She loves to learn and to please! On car rides she does very well. She sits in the passenger seat quietly and enjoys the drive. We do not have any cat or small dog history on her. Generally, she does well with male dogs of her same size (or larger) and same energy level.  However, we are hoping to place her in a home where she can be the only dog and the owner (or foster) would be willing to keep working with Diamond to continually develop her doggy social skills.  Diamond loves to give kisses and jumps to get attention.  We are working on this in training, but even still we do not recommend a home with small children under the age of 10.  A 6ft privacy fence required for adoption. \n\nMORE PICS IN COMMENTS BELOW\n\nMore question? Please email juliawithclasp@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE $200 she is spayed, utd on vaccinations, dewormed, heartworm negative, on heartworm preventions, on flea and tick prevention and she is microchipped.\n\nRESCUE STORY: Diamond was abandoned at a boarding facility by her owner. Several times he called to check on her and said he\u2019d come back, but he never did.\n\n",

Lilo came to us from a high kill shelter because she is blind due to mature cataracts. Most people think that blind animals are very handicapped but it doesn't slow Lilo down much. She navigates extremely well indoors. She figured out where the beds, water bowl, and door are in her foster home within a day. She would be best in a home with a fenced yard for her safety. She is house trained and seems to love everyone.",

            "description": "When families break up everyone in the family is affected. We know Raul certainly suffered from a family that went through changes, although we only know half of his story. \n\nWhen Raul was found tied up in front of the AALOC kennel it was obvious he had been well cared for: his coat was shiny and smooth, he was well-fed and friendly. A trip to the vet confirmed Raul was healthy. The vet also found a microchip and the AALOC team was able to track down a phone number from one of the previous owners. When contacted the previous owner said one day he came home from work several years ago and his partner was gone with Raul, leaving no information about their whereabouts. He hadn\u2019t heard or seen Raul again. Since then this owner has relocated to Chicago and can no longer care for Raul. So he surrendered Raul to AALOC. We are anxious to find a forever home for Raul but until he is formally adopted we are also looking for a foster family willing to shelter him since we\u2019re sure Raul has only known a loving home in the past.\n\nBased on his physical attributes and personality we believe Raul may be a full-bred American Staffordshire Terrier. Strong, very intelligent and super energetic, Raul is a fun guy looking for a new owner capable of providing him the care and guidance he needs. Raul loves to walk and easily does a mile and a half with our volunteer. Raul also loves to play: one of his favorite games is tug-of-war with his big red rubber ball. Sometimes he even lets you get it for just long enough to throw it out so he can run after it again. He is affectionate and friendly with people and already knows some commands. Raul is sweet-natured and not extremely large, but he is still young and does require consistent discipline and plenty of exercise. In addition, we would not recommend a home with a smaller dog or animal, but Raul may be a good companion for a larger female dog.\n\nPlease submit an application to adopt Raul on our website at www.aaloc.org. Once your application is reviewed and approved we will contact you to make an appointment to visit us at AALOC to meet Raul during visiting hours (10am to 3pm daily) and get to know him a bit.",

Lola has had a couple of homes that did not work out, the first person who loved her fell on hard times and had no choice but to surrender her to the shelter.  The second home decided after two years they \u201cdidn't want her anymore\u201d so back to the shelter she went.  (From the way Lola was acting when returned it would appear that she may not have been treated very nicely either.  No wonder she has trust issues and anxiety! ) Lola would do best in a quiet home with experienced and patient guardian(s) who will give her the time she needs to settle in/feel comfortable and are willing to help her with her anxiety from loud noises (fireworks etc).  No other dogs, cats, kids.\n\n\n\nThis dog is currently in a foster home. If you're interested in adopting please email us at volaux@yahoo.com for an adoption application. All dogs are UTD on shots and spayed/neutered prior to adoption.  PLEASE NOTE WE CAN NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS.\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK! www.facebook.com/volunteerauxiliary",

She can sniff out a belly rubber from miles away and just rolls over in front of anyone she deems fit for rubs! She isn\u2019t a fan of other dogs or cats but she is all you need in your life!\n\nGinger is a ball of energy! She has the energy of a puppy but also just LOVES to cuddle up and watch a movie! Ginger will play with any toy anytime but is not a big fan of other dogs. She will need to be in a home without small children as well due to some resource guarding issues. \n\nTraining in Longmont CO is free but mandatory with any foster to adopt from Dogs Unbroken to best set both the humans and dog up for success.",

He willingly goes in his crate for his meals and bedtime with a treat.\nOTHER DOGS: He does need slow introduction, as he can be very particular about his playmates. He does great with non-dominant and playful dogs. Excitable or dominant dogs are not his jam. He's a bit of a party police, but hey! we don't judge...\nCATS: He can ignore them unless they run. Then all's fair in tag...\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older. The boy has springs for feet and can parkour off little people.\nADOPTION DONATION: $800 (for both Dare and Lyn-Z)\nHEALTH: DARE was born with a cleft palate. After months of hand feeding, he had his surgery and it was successful. However, his mouth needs to be continuously monitored and consideration given to his selection of toys and diet. He has a sensitive stomach and has some food allergies. No chicken! He also has environmental allergies and is on Cytopoint injections every other month. Dare is neutered, microchipped, flea treated, and dewormed.\n\nHISTORY: Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to take in Dare and his family (his mother and brothers who have since been adopted) when they were relinquished to animal control.\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: Dare is an extremely outgoing little guy with people. He doesn't feel he has any enemies. He has no clue about stranger danger and loves meeting new people. He will definitely invite robbers into your home and offer them lattes along with your silverware. However, he's a little standoffish with dogs initially since he wants to be the boss of everybody and is not a dog who can go to dog parks or doggie daycare, as he has some bulldog stubbornness and dominance. Can we say party police unless he's the one throwing the party.\n\nHe is an energetic little guy but tires easily, having little heat intolerance and low stamina, most likely due to his cleft palate situation. He says it's because of his cleft palate, I say he has to embrace his bulldog genes and their physical limitations. He will definitely not be a jogging buddy and long strenuous hikes would be out of the question, as well as walks in hotter temperatures. He loves to be outside, however, and is great for walks when the weather is milder. I would say he's an easy-going 3-miler trail buddy.\n\nHe's quite content to play with his dog friends or amuse himself in the backyard. He prefers females and non-dominant dogs. He does need some time when doing dog introductions as he can be initially prickly. But he listens very well to corrections as long as the other dog is easygoing. He's not tolerant with dogs with \"issues\" because he's a hypocrite that way... so judgy. He's an overall goofy guy with a zest for life. He's the happiest little boy and very quick with his affection. He loves to cuddle and kiss, and kiss, and kiss... sooooo much kissing and so much bouncing. He will make out with anyone who is able and willing and if you're lying in bed, then you are fair game to cuddle and kiss.\n\nDare loves Lyn-Z and is her seeing eye dog. He's also her ESA when she is nervous and scared. He likes to give her kisses, too. They cuddle, they play, they sleep together, share toys, share people. They both enjoy leisurely walks along the beach at sunset.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and either a Martingale collar or a harness, depending on each dog's particular needs.\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO:\nMotley Zoo Animal Rescue is a volunteer run, foster based, 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Redmond, WA. Motley Zoo does not have a traditional shelter location, but instead, utilizes private foster homes which care for the animals individually, in a home environment, until a \"furever\" home is found.\n\nMotley Zoo also runs \"Rock Star Treatment\" Dog Daycare & Training Studio in Redmond, WA which is a day-use facility and does not hold kennels of adoptable animals. The dogs there are owned animals who come to the facility while their families are at work and school so they can play and socialize in a safe environment. We dub this service our \"Year-round\" fundraising program which helps us support our rescue animals and the $15,000/ month vet bills we incur. This Studio location does have an Adoptable Cat Lounge, where cats may live until adoption, which is the exception to any aforementioned rules.\n\nPlease email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application so we can get you started on the journey to finding a new, furry friend! Once you have been approved to adopt, then we can set up a meeting with the animal you have been matched with.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a dog in need!\n\nWoof,\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

YOU MUST CALL TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING. THIS MAY CHANGE AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO UPDATE, SO IF YOUR CALL ISN'T RETURNED WITHIN 2 BUSINESS DAYS, WE MAY HAVE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC COMPLETELY IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP OURSELVES AND OUR OWN FAMILIES HEALTHY. WE WILL STILL CARE FOR THE DOGS DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Janice. I'm about 7 years old and I weigh about 65 lbs. \nI was found as a stray in the Wellsville area and I was brought in to the pound. \nI am a very sweet, energetic, playful girl looking for a loving family to join. \nI am very clean in my kennel at night and I appear to have maybe been a house dog at some point. \nI get along with some, but not all other dogs, so I should meet any dogs that I would live with before I get adopted.\nIf you're looking for a sweet dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me. \n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE. \n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt. \n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter. \n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am. \nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance. \nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend. \n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable. \n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663 \nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

Gunner loves to swim with his foster siblings, he loves tennis balls and loves car rides!\n\nGunner is a smart boy. He is trained on all commands as well as off-leash!

            "description": "Beautiful Lulu... she is smart, energetic, active and will be your loyal new best friend. Lulu came to us after her family couldn't keep her through no fault of her own. Shelter life has been very stressful for Lulu and she still hasn't completely settled in, despite being with us for several months.\n\nLulu needs an owner who has had Malinois experience. She needs consistency, mental stimulation, and tons of exercise. Lulu is very high strung and if she is not getting the activity she needs, she will make it known. Lulu has gone through training sessions and we expect any potential adopter to follow through with consistent training. Lulu does well in play groups with other dogs, but would be best as the only child due to some food guarding. Lulu also needs an adult only home with not a lot of people coming and going and no small children or teens, and preferably in a single family home/condo with a yard (no apartments!).\n\nWith all that said, Lulu really is a great girl who will make someone very happy. She can't wait to find her future confident best friend who she can be loyal, protective and make smile. If you're interested in learning more about Lulu, please send us an email or give us a call.\n\n*Please complete our online application for further consideration. We do best fit for both dog and family, and completing an application is not a guarantee of approval.",

She loves hiking, is great on a leash and one of the best companions you could ask for. She is crate and potty trained. \n\nArrow will only be adopted to a home with NO children and NO other animals. \n\nArrow has had a history of being strongly vocally afraid when meeting new people which she is working through in her current foster home with a professional trainer. Arrow requires an adopter that is willing to work with our trainer during her adoption process. \nOur trainer will help to implement her structured yet humble training that she has been taught into their lives with her for a smooth transition. \nArrow is a one of a kind of dog that will need someone who is willing to learn her training and help teach her that she has a person or family that is in charge and will take care of her, so she doesn\u2019t have to feel the need to protect herself anymore. \nShe thrives off of knowing who is in charge, what are the rules, and what her role is. If you are that person that is willing to give this beautiful dog a chance and learn some fun training along the way than please apply to meet beautiful Arrow\n",

Jake is active and LOVES to play with other dogs!   Jake has to warm up to new people, but once he does, he gets very attached.   Jake must have a female in the home as he is much more comfortable with women.  We would love for our sweet man to have his own family.  PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM!  (12/14/19)  Jake is awesome!   He is very attached to his foster mom, and he is starting to warm up to his foster dad.  Jake will definitely need a female in his longterm foster home.   He is active and does not act like he has any health issues.   (11/14/19)  Little Jake is in need of a longterm foster home while we have his cardio issues assessed.  He has a high grade heart murmur and some other abnormalities.  Jake will be seen by a cardiologist for treatment.  He is a sweet little man who needs some help.   The stress of the shelter environment is not the best for him, so we are hoping to get him out and into a loving, lowkey foster home.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.This poor little guy is Pablo and he is a bully mix that was born around 5/20/18 and now weighs about 60 pounds. He has had a rough life already but we hope those days are forever behind him. You can tell from his photos that he suffered greatly with an embedded collar and a cable tie stuck around him that slashed up his neck so severely, it looked like someone tried to decapitate him. Pablo walked up to a local business on Palafox at the perfect time because a good samaritan saw him and knew he needed immediate help. Pablo's neck wounds have been treated by our vet and he is healed. On top of the neck injury, Pablo was so overrun with fleas and parasites that most of his hair was missing. Despite the trauma and pain he was obviously suffering from, Pablo is a very sweet and friendly boy. Pablo must have an expierenced, prevoius bully breed handler due to his resources guarding on food and toys. These issues could be addressed with proper training from the right person.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Pablo is $150 and includes his neuter, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

            "description": "Wed like you to meet this handsome pit bull mix named Angelo. When he came into the shelter about 6 months ago, he had heartworms, a disease transmitted by mosquitos, which is easily prevented by giving your dog a monthly pill. His previous owner did not bother to do this. Fortunately a volunteer paid for the expensive heartworm treatment so that he could be cured. Now all healthy, he is actively looking for a forever home. Because of his muscular build and serious expression, Angelo can appear a bit intimidating in his kennel. But as soon as he sees someone he knows coming to take him out, our boy gets all happy and wiggley and his friendly personality emerges. In the play yard, he chases after his toys and then joyfully runs over to greet his person and wait for cuddles and ear rubs. He also likes to go for leash walks, but is strong and needs to learn loose leash walking. Since he loves food treats, training shouldnt be very difficult for a patient, consistent owner. When we introduced Angelo to another dog he did very well, so if you have a dog, bring it in for a meet and greet. (Dont forget your rabies certificate!) Angelo is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and all ready to move into your home and your heart. Angelo. He can come off as a bit loud and intimidating but dont let that scare you off. Once this handsome fella gets to know you and warms up to you, hes a great dog and companion. Meet our handsome pit bull mix named Angelo. When Angelo came into the shelter he was heartworm positive, a disease transmitted by misquitos. A volunteer paid for his heartworm treatment so that he could be cured. Now that Angelo has beat his heartworm disease he is actively seeking his forever home with a loving family who can give him all the attention this sweet boy deserves. When in the play yard he chases after his toys and joyfully runs over to greet his person for cuddles and belly rubs. Angelo loves to be center of attention and show off his awesome tricks such as sit and give paw. He loves his treats unconditionally and will do commands just to get them! Angelo has alot of love to give, once you become his person you have a life time friend in him. Angelo is notorious for his smile that will light up the room!",

He adores people, knows the command sit, and down and takes treats very gently from your fingers.\n\nKermit is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. He was an abandoned dog in a Chicago suburb and was rescued from the pound by Lucky Dogs.\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt Kermit, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net for an adoption application.\n\nHis adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. He is healthy, neutered, up-to-date on vaccine, micro-chipped, heartworm-tested and on monthly heartworm protection.\n\nHe is being fostered in Chicago.",

He has an ear issue that GRRAND is getting him treatment for as well, and this could be an ongoing issue for a bit. Bolt is crate trained and is looking for a home that has another stable dog in the house. He is very dog selective but we have found that the more stable of a dog he is with, the happier he is!\nPlease check back later for more info\u2026\n\nAt this time, we are unable to process any applications that are outside of the geographic areas listed below:\nGreater Louisville, KY (including adjacent southern Indiana)\nGreater Lexington, KY\nSouthern Indiana Counties:  Clark and Floyd\nOhio Counties: Hamilton, Butler, Warren, some areas within Clermont county, Montgomery and Green\nNorthern KY Counties: Boone, Kenton and Campbell\n \nTo inquire about a specific dog, we require that you first submit an adoption application.  Visit http://grrand.org/online-adoption-application/  to access our online application.  You do not need to fill out an application for each dog you are interested in learning more about.  Once your application is reviewed a GRRAND volunteer will contact you to begin the process.  Our Adoption Placement Coordinator will work with you to find a dog with the characteristics to best fit your family.\nPlease visit our website at www.grrand.org for information about our adoption procedures and the areas we service.<br><br>",

She would be best in home without cats. She adores people, knows the command sit and takes treats very gently from your fingers.\n\nCarmen is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. She was rescued by Lucky Dog Rescue from a Southern Illinois shelter and brought to Chicago to find a loving.\n\nTo get an adoption application or more information on Carmen, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net.\n\nHer adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. She is healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and micro-chipped.\n\nShe is being fostered in Chicago.\n",

I have had my fair share of homes, but I have not found the right fit yet. I have been here awhile now and im really wanting a couch or chair of my own to lay on, ive seen so many of my friends find homes and im wondering why I havent. I really am a good boy, I just get a little anxious sometimes and need someone special to love me. Are you special enough to love me? \n\nLets go for long walks on the beach (or in a park, I'm not picky) and maybe chill on the couch in the evening with a pizza ;)\n\nLet me know if you would like to meet up!

He knows his basic commands, is an excellent leash-walker, and LOVES to meet new people.  Clayton is an absolute sweet pea who can never have enough toys, especially stuffed animals.  He's also a really versatile guy!  Want to go for a walk in the park? Clayton is ready!  Feeling like a day spent on the couch would be better?  Clayton approves...as long as he can lay his head in your lap.  He has the kindest eyes and most adorable little blep.  He would love nothing more than a loving family and a stable place to call home.\n\nClayton would be best in a home without cats or small children.  He needs an experienced, patient adopter.  Clayton can be dog selective (prefers more submissive dogs), so proper introductions would be required in a controlled setting (Dog U).  \n\nIf you're interested in meeting Clayton, please submit an application on our website!\n\nhttp://mustlovepawsrescue.com/\n\n",

And I'm the most adorable, smart, playful dog around. I'm super affectionate! I love to lay my head on your lap, and give kisses,and snuggle next to you on the couch when allowed. \"I'm pretty independent,I like a little bit of affection and attention I prefer to play with my foster sister. I would be great with a active family, specially one who loves dog walks and dog parks , and bonus if they have another dog to play with.\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n.\n\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He has had one leg done now and is recovering beautifully. His second surgery is scheduled soon. We can't wait to get him back up and running again! For more information on Cody, please contact our adoptions office at 410-268-4388.",

He is a wonderful companion but needs to learn to trust you and will need someone who is patient and understanding. But, once he knows you love him and are a good person, he will shower you with his love.\n\nRocky loves to be by your side. He wants to sit on the couch with you and expects to sleep in bed with you. He will even help with laundry or enjoy a morning cup of coffee with you. You will always find him at your feet under the dinner table at dinner time. He gets excited about his morning and evening walks and is a great running companion. Rocky can easily run three miles and is just that motivation you need sometimes from a running partner. Rocky has been on road trips to the mountains and swimming in the rivers. He loves to go on hikes and play with his toys in the yard. Rocky has his blankets he drags around the house and finds his perfect spot on the chair to gaze out the window.\n\nRocky lives with 5 cats and is pretty good with them, although he is occasionally interested and will playful run after them. Once he gets a swipe to the face he backs off. He lives with an alpha lab. Rocky does like to play and will get a bit wild with other dogs but my lab knows how to handle him and will put him in his place. He is gets uneasy when other dogs pass during walks and will need constant coaching and reassurance that he is safe. Treats work well for this and he has been working on this for a long time. He will do well with continuous reinforcement.\n\nRocky will do best in a home with a yard, where he won't be home for long periods of time alone, where he gets plenty of exercise and adventure, where he will be part of the family and get lots of attention. He is uneasy around young children and will do best in a quiet household with adults or adults with older children (over 16) who know how to handle dogs well.\n\nRocky is a true love bug and we want to find that perfect family for him. We know you are out there.",

He gets along with other dogs and has more of a dominant personality. He is very sweet and eager to learn. He walks well on a leash and has no aggression or resource guarding Issues. It is unknown how Thor is with children or small animals. Thor will need at least a 6ft metal privacy fence and would do best with a companion dog. Thor will need to be primarily an outdoor dog as he does not do well indoors and would need a lot of training to do so.\nMUST live in a state where it is legal to own a wolf hybrid.\n\nIf you're interested in Thor, please read our adoption requirements first at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/adopt_a_wolf_adoption_requirements.html\n\nthen submit an application at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/wolf_adoption_adopt_a_wolf_application.php\n\nor contact us by calling (732) 534-5745\n\nDo not inquire about or apply for Thor if you live in any the following States: Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine.

            "description": "Monty is a beautiful blue pittie who will be turning 8 years old in December 2019. He is not good with male dogs, but he does well with most females as long as they aren't too high energy. He is a low energy dog who prefers cuddling on the couch with his person, so he'd be great as an only dog, as well. A meet and greet is always best if there is another dog in the home. Monty has been raised around young kids and is an absolute sweetheart with them. The last few years he has lived primarily outside, but he is adjusting quickly to being an indoor dog again and loving it. He is getting a refresher on household manners and potty training in his foster home, and he hasn't had an accident yet. He knows his basic commands and is a really well behaved boy. He does best in a house rather than an apartment, as the noises all around him make him nervous when no one is home with him. Otherwise, he likely won't move off your couch when you have to leave him.",

            "description": "The first thing you will notice is that he is very handsome. He loves to play chase, do zoomies, and play with his Kong toy.  He invents games, like keep away when my husband calls him to put him in his kennel.  He will play bow, zip around you and jump up and down to get a few more minutes of your time.\n\nSomeone invested a lot of love and time with Kade when he was younger but failed to teach him good  citizenship skills and basic obedience.  This means, at times, when playing, he will put your arm or hand in his mouth and apply a little too much force but he is not trying to hurt you. He just gets a little too excited.   His saving grace is that he very smart and loves to learn and please you.\n\nWhen we let him out of his kennel, he goes out immediately.  When he comes back in we run him through some of the basic commands and reward him with treats.  Then, when possible, we go back to normal household duties and he follows us around like a good dog should.  What I am trying to say is that he is a little rough around the edges but with a little time and positive training methods, he is going to be a great dog.\n\nKade is very special and in the right home he will blossom into a great dog, a once in a lifetime dog for some lucky family.\n\nP. S.  Kade is being fostered by a dog trainer with over 40 years experience.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n*2 years old\n*Crate trained\n*House trained\n*Gets along with friendly female dogs\n",

Like other scent hounds, I do enjoy sniffing out my surroundings while on my walks. I am a bit strong on the leash, but I'm young so I'll probably slow down some as I get older and with daily exercise. I came from the middle of Virginia where hound dogs like me are popular -- perhaps, I went chasing after a coon or something and got lost? Who knows? But, now, I'm ready for a new home, a place where I can share all the love I have to give my new owner -- and let me tell you that's a lot! I'm just an affectionate kind of guy, so this homeless stuff just ain't for me! So if you're looking for a hound dog to share some lovin' with, choose me!!! Dan will do best with an experienced dog owner.This dog can only be adopted within the Washington DC metro area",

Belle was a stray, who ended up becoming mom to 9 puppies before a good samaritan took her to be spayed. They really wanted Belle to be theirs forever, but she did not want to share space with smaller animals, and a short fence would not contain her will to explore. Belle needs work on house training, and should meet any other dog siblings before going home.\nBelle Sophia is incredibly treat motivated and will learn very quickly to get those treats! So far, she knows how to sit and lay down. Housetraining will be a breeze using treats as positive reinforcement. She loves sitting on your lap and will nuzzle you to let you know she wants more affection!\n DOB 10-1-17, weighs 45 pounds...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

He is very treat motivated and a quick learner. He loves to cuddle and be with his person. He does have leash aggression so he will need a home as an only dog and a fenced yard. While he does great with the other dogs in his foster home it takes him a while to ok with other dogs especially if meeting them on a leash. If interested in Sid please note that he does need a home as an ONLY dog and FENCED YARD!",

            "description": "Ladybelle has been waiting for such a long time to be discovered since coming to us in the summer of 2019 as a stray.  She was adopted briefly, but returned when the adopter simply changed their mind.  She is about 5 1/2 years old and a shelter is nowhere for Ladybelle.  She is very anxious while in a kennel, but once she's away from the hub-bub, Ladybelle turns into a calm, relaxed girl that wants nothing more than to get lots of attention from you, take a walk, and run and play.  She has lots of energy and she's very silly and goofy.  She sits perfectly when asked and takes treats very gently, and she's a big fan of flopping on her back to get a bellyrub.  Ladybelle gets along with most larger dogs so if you have one, bring them in to meet her.  She needs a cat-free home though.  Ladybelle sure would just love to finally have a family of her own!  File#29148  8/8/19\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Ladybelle.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

            "description": "Dexter is a good looking 1yr old cattle dog mix he was transferred in from another shelter when they were out of space and he was out of time.\n\nHe's a bit on the timid side around people that he doesn't know but will warm up quickly if you just take your time. He has been mixed with other dogs but cab be selective and bossy. Dexter needs a home with a dog savvy person who is willing to spend some time helping hm adjust to new people. We think he would do best in a home with kids 8yrs of age and over.\n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630.

            "description": "Maple is about 9 years old. This poor girl has not had the best start in life and we would really like to find her happily ever after. She was running as a stray in Flint and a local rescue managed to secure her. It is apparent she was used for breeding and was even still full of milk when found. We are guessing that she was tossed outside when she was no longer \u201cuseful\u201d to them. She is such a sweet, loving girl. She was in pretty rough shape  when she was found. She does fine with the dogs in her foster home but it took us awhile to get there. It took a lot of training and positive reinforcement. She does not do well meeting new dogs as she tends to be confrontational. For this reason, we feel she would do best as an only dog. She does great with cats. She does tend to be very fearful about being outside by herself. She will go out and take care of her business but is a bit frantic to be let back in. Although we are working on it, she is not that great on a leash. She would do best with a fenced yard. She tends to have separation anxiety in new situations so does take time to adjust to a new setting and routine. Maple is spayed, HW checked and is up to date on shots.

Our adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date shots, Microchip, Alabama Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you if located up north.\n\nThe pets are delivered by a licensed transporter.\n\nPDAR.info@gmail.com\n\n**To see all of our pets available for adoption, please copy this link.\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/search/pets-for-adoption/?shelter_id%5B0%5D=AL450&sort%5B0%5D=recently_added\n\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES. If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application.\n\nPlease copy and paste the following URL for the adoption application:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/WUEijuPLvtcsTT3t7\n\nPlease be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in AL will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have.\n\nNOTE: All Paws of Dixie animals are located in AL foster homes. They will be transported north after adoption.\n\nIf there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\nWe DO NOT adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration.",

Trumble loves to show off his tricks and will do anything for you if there is food involved. \nTrumble prefers to be without the company of another dog and would need to be your one and only dog. He has some insecurities in new situations, but if you gain his trust he is totally worth it.",

He still takes a little time to trust, but once you have gained it, you are in for life. \nOnce Zion is comfortable with his people, he enjoys walks, golf cart rides, car rides, playing with his stuffed toys, swimming in the pool at the dog park and enjoying a good hang out session on the couch.

She was a dog that ran in the woods with her sister for some time, a stray, she was completely unsocialized and had to be trapped in order to get her to the vet to spay her. When she came to our shelter she would not walk at all and had to be carried from her indoor kennel to her outdoor enclosure. It took many months before she was able to be walked on a leash and felt comfortable here. She is still very timid and will shy away from anything she isn't familiar with. \nShe needs to have a companion dog her age to play with and that will give her more confidence; she needs a fenced in yard with a 5' fence or higher. She is a dog that is on the small side of large and over 50lbs. She looks smaller in the pictures here than she actually is. She's slender. \nHer disposition is good, although fearful she is not aggressive, she is fine with children, she is not food agresssive. \nShe will require a lot of patience and months of getting used to a new environment. She will not be a dog that you can walk down a residential street, at least not at this point. She will just sit down and not move if she's uncomfortable.  It took her over 6 months to get used to the shelter environment. \nShe doesn't really like being in a kennel, but she's fairly housetrained, at least if kept in a room, she doesn't have accidents. She's not high energy, but she does enjoy being outside and will run away if let off leash like most hounds, she chases deer and wildlife.\n\nAdoption fee is $150\nShe is spayed, heartworm tested, vaccinated, wormed, flea and tick treated",

He is learning to sit when petted, but sometimes he gets so excited for a hug that he will jump up on people.  He is crate trained and can be in one for quite a long time with no accidents or barking.  He is unpredictable around other dogs and would be best as an only dog with his own fenced yard.  He would not be a good candidate to take to dog parks where he would be interacting with lots of new dogs he didn't know.  He is sweet with people.\nStryker is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435/752-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

He is about 2 years old. He seems to be good with other dogs and is happy and smart.  He likes to be around people.  He has a very high pitched bark.  He would love to be a hiking buddy or camping companion.  Oscar is great with other dogs and could spend all day playing. He is very active. He needs a home where he can get lots of exercise.  He could use a job to do.  He is not good with cats.\n\nOscar is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200 which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435/752-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",
