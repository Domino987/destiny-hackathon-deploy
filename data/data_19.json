            "description": "Smudge / Female / 2 Years / 70 lbs / Great Pyrenees Mix / Brampton\n\nMeet Smudge! Despite her size, Smudge fancies herself a bit of a lap dog! She will snuggle her nose into your armpit or under your hand to ask for love. Her fosters describe her as \u201ca super sweet and loving soul.\u201d She is gentle, affectionate, cuddly, goofy, well mannered and protective. She loves walks and running, but is also the resident nap queen and couch potato. All she wants is to be near her people, and bonds closely with her family.\n\nWhen her family comes home Smudge is very excited, and may even try and go in for a hug. With new people she may wag her tail but is shy at first. Generally she will look to her trusted humans for approval before going ahead for a sniff. Once she builds a bond with someone she relies on them for encouragement, safety and love. Smudge has been tested with children and she does amazing. She will do best with dog savvy children who understand the basics of dog body language and when she needs a break.\n\nWhen she is left alone she is crated and settles quickly. She is also crated at night and may whine for a few minutes before settling. Overall she is a very good girl and could likely be trusted with free reign. With adequate opportunities to use the washroom, she is fully potty trained.\n\nCurrently Smudge is getting three walks a day, plus additional time to play in the backyard. Her favorite thing is to run freely and get silly in a secured space. She is amazing on leash and doesn\u2019t pull unless she wants to smell something or go potty. When crossing busy streets she does get scared so she needs gentle encouragement to continue. She is afraid of cars when they pass and get stressed during car rides. Building her confidence surrounding vehicles will be an ongoing part of her journey.\n\nIn her foster home, Smudge has been kept off of furniture. She learns house rules quickly and always respects them. Smudge\u2019s greatest joy in life is making her family proud! She is smart and has already learned sit, paw, down, come, leave it, recall and is working on stay.\n\nSmudge\u2019s ideal family would be a house with a fully fenced backyard. She may be able to adapt to a large apartment, as long as her exercise needs are met. Due to her anxieties with traffic and cars, she would prefer homes in the suburbs or quiet country. Smudge does well with all other dogs, but has not been tested with cats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Smudge please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nSmudge\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

IF YOU APPLY and if WE APPROVE YOU it means we are assuming when you meet any of our dogs and fall in love you're ready to ADOPT AND HIM OR HER HOME!\n\nMeet NICO!\nThis beautiful purebred Aussie male is just 10 months old - he is a typical young Aussie who can wrestle and play with other large dogs or cuddle and lie calmly with his favorite humans.\nNico was originally adopted from DASH at 10 weeks old - but his adoptive family sadly had to return him because they felt they weren't the right household for Nico's life; as a herding dog he was occasionally apt to run and play with kids but at 4/5/6 months old he began to \"nip,\" a common trait since he is a herding dog but one requires consistency and cooperation in re-training.\nNico's family has reiterated that he is not a mean or aggressive dog, the return is \"because of them, not Nico.\" We asked them to call our trainer at our expense if they wanted to work with him but ultimately we all agreed their kids were too young and Nico will be better off in a more herding breed-experienced home.\nIn the the week since Nico came to my house he has been a model dog. He is friendly, cuddly, obedient, house trained and definitely deserves to get into a Forever home.\nNico plays GREAT with similar sized or larger dogs. He is also very mellow and laid-back, doesn't demand attention 24/7 and loves outdoor walks as much as indoor cuddling! He actually has very moderate energy for an Aussie ~ his former owner told me she is sure their home was \"too chaotic\" for Nico and is happy to hear he is enjoying his new temporary life.\nNico is full-grown at 55 lbs; he knows basic commands and is eager to please. He is happy, confident, definitely needs to decompress in his \"new forever\" environment. Since HE is only a baby/puppy. we are looking for a home without human kiddos so he can be the baby for awhile!\nHe would also be a great companion, jogging partner, snuggle-buddy and co-pilot for a single person or couple with time, love and attention to give him.\nIf you're interested and meeting Nico for adoption please complete our application on www.dashdog.org Then, TEXT SARA; I have has Nico at my house!\nGeneral Info - PLEASE READ! *Our $350 adoption fee is based on the cost of rescuing, transporting and vetting each dog; we do not try to compete on prices with municipal shelters whose funds are paid by the city.

            "description": "Meet Gerald! Gerald is a Very Important Pup here at Charleston Animal Society!\n\nIn the beginning of December, we took in a transfer of 15 dogs (Including Gerald) from the Bahamas. All of these dogs have displayed under socialized and fearful behavior. From this transfer there are four dogs left. We are looking for a patient adopter who has a background in handling a dog with these types of anxieties and who can create a safe environment. This adopter has to understand these dogs can be a flight risk, they are sensitive to noises and hesitant to approach people. They are also looking for a home with a confident helper dog. Any potential adopter willing to open their home and hearts to any of these four dogs please reach out to the Charleston Animal Society Behavior Team to set up a meet and greet.

            "description": "Hello!! My name is Dover. I am a one year old pointer mix being fostered in Chippewa falls, WI. This is actually my second time with my foster family so my mom is going to make me be a little more specific about the kind of family that I need ? So I am a very active boy. I need another youngish (or older active) dog to play with. No exceptions. I get along with all the dogs that I've met. So far so good? Ok. I also can be a bit jumpy so kids over say 5 might be best. I just would hate to knock anyone over. The 6 kids in my house keep me busy and I LOVE to run with my dad. He says I do really well. I can go 6 miles!! Let's talk about those frisky felines. They are everywhere in this house! The ones that ignore me are awesome. But the ones that get all hissy and up in my face - well I like to bark at them and try to play because what are they doing?! I've never hurt a cat though. Just something to keep in mind. I am potty trained and sleep well in my kennel. Oh and I'm up to date on all of my shots plus I'm fixed! Juuuust one more thing. I really like just MY family in MY house. I tend to bark aggressively at strangers and my mom has to put me in my kennel. This is something I'm not proud of and I definitely will need to work on. Outside of my house say on a walk I'm hesitant about strangers but I warm up.  Phew. That part was hard to say but it's good to be honest up front. I am a lover though. I am so soft and my family calls me butter boy. I love them but I need to find my forever home. Is it you? My adoption fee is $300.

This happy, smiling, young man is estimated to be about 1.5 years old. His breed is our best guess based off his physical attributes. We can\u2019t say enough good things about this dog! For spending 6 months in a rural shelter before we pulled him into our organization, he\u2019s pretty awesome. Willing to learn and treat motivated makes molding him into the perfect dog a breeze! He\u2019ll do just about anything for a meaty treat or squeaky ball, will gladly play fetch till your arm falls off. But afterwards is ready for a good snuggle and nap! He already knows the commands for sit, down, and shake and can catch and toy or treat you throw his way! He has the build of a true athlete and is a strong, solid build. Leash manners are a work in process. He has excellent house manners and hasn\u2019t offered to lift a leg in his foster home and he doesn\u2019t use the furniture like a jungle gym either. Despite his size, he thinks he belongs in your lap giving you kisses while you scratch his rump. He\u2019s a truly ladies man and can be slower to warm up to men but if they properly greet him with a hotdog, he\u2019s cool. He lives with two cats in his foster home and will follow them if they run around but is easily called off and harmless. He also is coexisting peacefully with the female dog in his foster home. With some continued obedience and a firm handler, Meatloaf will be the most loyal companion to his family!\n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested. His ideal home would be with older children as he doesn\u2019t realize his size and one with a fenced in yard. If you\u2019d like to add this young and handsome bachelor to your home please fill out an application at: https://forms.gle/WkiD5PgdmfjUTteF9",

            "description": "Meet Morty, this sweet guy was surrendered to us with Lucy after they lost their person. While Lucy and Morty are great friends and love to hangout, they aren't bonded and don't have to be adopted together, but they wouldn't mind it either!  (check out Lucy's bio too!) Morty is a great example of why Black Labs are so great. He is a quiet, calmer guy, who can still be playful. A true gentleman he will wait his turn to go through the doorway, and he isn't even really interested in getting on the furniture, even though we've asked!\n\nThis guy is a bit overweight at 100lbs, the vet would like to see him around 90. He definitely is a gentle giant, he will gladly share his bowl and walk away with food left in it. Outside he enjoys chasing a ball or rolling and galloping through the snow. He would probably enjoy a yard to take ownership of, and we'll bet he will love sunbathing in the summer! \n\nMorty does fine with other dogs and has not been cat tested. This guy would need a friend to have at home or an owner who is home most of the time. He is house trained and around 7 years old.\n\nMorty is UTD on all vaccines and preventative, neutered, and microchipped.\n\nMorty's adoption fee is $250, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nIf interested in meeting Morty you must fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nMorty and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption through rescue for your new family companion!",

The current cost for medication to keep her stable is $365 per month. This will be an ongoing issue throughout her life but she is doing well with consistent veterinary care. She will need blood work every 6 months and it is recommended her adopters keep a seizure journal to track her episodes. Any potential adopters can speak to our vet team directly to better understand her needs**\n\nMeet Peggy! Peggy was pulled from a shelter living in very poor conditions. Unfortunately the facility didn\u2019t have the resources to support its residents and left them tied up outside. Thankfully our partners in Mexico stepped up and took as many as they could support at the time. After a full meal and some much needed care, Peggy made the trip to Canada in search of her forever home!\n\nPeggy is described as friendly, laid back, affectionate, cuddly, smart and loving. Everyone who meets her remarks on how happy she is and that her tail is always wagging. She\u2019s not much for toys yet but she sure does love her walks! Peggy is in heaven when she gets her paws massaged. She is eager to please her people and will make an excellent addition to a family who understand her specific needs.\n\nPeggy is a social butterfly and happy to meet all people. She will be the first at the door with a happy smile, welcoming anyone into her home. she has not had much exposure to children but likely would do well with humans of all sizes!\n\nSo far Peggy hasn\u2019t been left alone much, but has been tested up to four hours. She hasn\u2019t shown any signs of seperation anxiety but is always happy when her family comes home. She is definitely a little escape artist so all doors must be secured at all times. Any access to the backyard should be monitored and leashed if there is any risk of her getting loose.\n\nPeggy has done well with training in all areas and has adapted beautifully to life as a pet. She already knows sit, stay, paw, no and come! She will need ongoing support on leash training as she can be very reactive to squirrels. Due to her desire to chase small animals we think she would do best in a cat-free home. She does well with other well adjusted canine siblings!\n\nPeggy\u2019s ideal home would be a house with a fully fenced backyard. She drinks a lot of water due to her medication so needs frequent bathroom breaks throughout the day. She loves her walks and would do well in the city (or suburbs) as she has not expressed any fears to noises. She loves being with her family and would prefer they are home more often than not. Most importantly her family needs to have a solid understanding of her medical needs and be able to support her through them (see special needs).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Peggy, please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nPeggy\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

I'm searching for my forever family to give me the good life, inclusive of lots of pets and unlimited snuggles! One of my favorite hobbies is snuggling into blankets and rolling on pillows and cushions. I also love to go on walks and am very good on the leash! I don't pull, and I wait patiently for my human. I move a little bit slower, so I wouldn't mind having an older human to guide me on my walks! After a nice, ambling stroll I love to take a good snooze. I'm very good at napping, and also sleep through the night. When I stand up from my nap you'll hear me groan a little bit, but I'm just letting you know how good it feels to stretch out my joints, and I get around just fine. I won't get up on any of your furniture because I prefer to nap on the ground on a soft blanket. I love being around my foster family and do well with my foster dog brother, but he is significantly younger and has \"puppy energy\", and I'd prefer that my forever family be more slow paced and relaxed. I am not interested in friends of the feline persuasion, no cats for me! I hope that my forever family will have lots of squeaky toys. I will provide a ton of laughs with my squeaky toy antics, I love to play with them and toss them around! I am 100% potty trained, and know basic commands like \"sit\" and \"come\". I'm food motivated and my foster mom says that I'm a little bit too good of an eater, so I'm working on slimming down just a little. Are you looking for a gentle, loving forever friend? If so, I'm your gal! Submit your application today!\n\nCompletion of an Adoption Application via our website (www.RescueCrew.org) is the best way to show your interest in an animal and is the first step in the adoption process.\n\nAll companion animals adopted by The Rescue Crew are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, tested for FIV/FeLK (cats) or heartworm (dogs), microchipped, dewormed and provided with monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives.\n\nThe Rescue Crew is a foster based rescue organization, meaning all of our adoptable pets are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a physical location where you can stop by to visit the animals - we require the completion of an Adoption Application prior to meeting any of our adoptable pets in foster care.\n\nFor the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well.",

Love my foster family and take every chance to get a head scratch or belly rub. I enjoy playing with toys, other dogs and walks. I haven\u2019t come across any cats but sure enjoy watching the squirrels and birds outside. I am house trained, obey basic commands, will sit and take treats politely. There are times I get excited with burst of energy .I am looking for my forever home and have so much love to give. I can be a lap dog if you let me. I didn\u2019t have the best life before coming to my foster home. I take a little time to trust new people we are working on that with my foster mom and dad with good progress. It will be mandatory to have a fenced yard to exercise. I can not be put in a closed crate however I sleep in a crate with the door open. There must be no children, and to safely play and run a fenced yard is a must. I am located in Antioch, IL, contact Foster Cathy at (224) 944-9654. ADOPTION FEE $350 and I am fully vette",

I would like a family that I can learn and grow with. I will need all the training you can give me since I'm a puppy and don't know much yet. A fenced yard to play in and kids or other dogs to play with would be fantastic. So, if you're looking for an adorable pup like me to join your family, come in and say hello!",

Brody is only 2 years old and he has Tarsal Osteochondrosis. Kind of like arthritis from what we understand. We were told by one of the best bone doctors around that even with surgery it won't help long term. He is currently getting treats daily to help with hips and joints. Brody weighs about 65lbs. He will need a home without stairs. Brody would do best as an only dog. He does ok with most dogs but can be testy at times if he is resting on his bed. He also would be best in a home with no kids. Brody is honestly a big goofball. He does try to run and play some. But for the most part he is very chill. He really deserves a loving home where he can relax and just be loved. Exercise is good whether it be going for walks or a fenced yard for him to walk or run around in. For whoever adopts him we will have hip and joint treats sent to you for life. He just really deserves someone who will have patience and be kind to this darling boy. He is crate trained and housebroke. Brody is neutered, utd on shots, wormed and microchipped. If you think you can give him that wonderful loving home he so deserves... please fill out an application at\n\nhttps://www.pethelpersinc.org/adoption-application/\n\nHe is adoption fee is 150.00 and he is being fostered in Clarksburg WV\nFor more information on this animal email adoptionisforever@pethelpersinc.org.\n\nPet Helpers is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foster based volunteer rescue located in Fairmont, WV. We do adopt out of state to approved applicants, if you are willing to drive to WV to pick up your pet. We do not fly or use transport companies. Our adoption fee is $150.00 for mixed breed puppies and adult dogs, $225.00 for full blooded puppies and adult dogs and $50.00 for cats and kittens. Regardless if the animal is a mixed breed or full blooded they are spayed/neutered prior to adoption IF they are old enough. If they are too young at the time of adoption, then it is your financial responsibility to spay/neuter the pet by the age of 6 months and you must provide proof for our files that it has been done. All of our pets are checked by a vet, given the shots appropriate for their age and any other treatment deemed necessary by the vet. All of our pets are adopted as indoor pets and are not be outdoors tied to a box 24/7. The pet you are adopting has been living in a home with a foster family. You are expected to take possession of the pet you are applying for within a few days of application approval. This will enable us to accept another pet into that home. Because we are a rescue, and believe that spaying and neutering is crucial in stopping the reproduction of unwanted puppies/kittens and massive amounts of animals dying daily in shelters across the country, we expect any animal already in your home to be spayed/neutered. If for any reason you are unable to keep the pet you have adopted you are required to return them to Pet Helpers, Inc. They are not to be sold or given away.\n\nCheck us out on Facebook!!!!!! We hope you will give us two paws up, like our page and share with your friends. Pet Helpers, Inc.",

Balls are his favorite thing, and he loves to snuggle as well. We think he would do great with children 7 and up. He is totally house trained.\n\nWith our trainer, Indy was happy to trade toys for a small treat and quickly began to respond to a Drop command. He is resistant to the crate so we are taking it slow. Indy knows Sit, but is still learning to do it around distractions. He responds well to slip lead pressure on walks.\n\nHe used to live with a mini schnauzer and had no issues there. He has also met other dogs while out and about with his foster mom and has done well, though he can be overwhelming with little dogs. However, he also has a history of dog selectivity so any introductions should go slowly.",

He gets along well with other dogs, but they should be of a similar age/activity level to him.. Reese loves people and gets so happy to see them! He would do best in a home without young children, despite loving them, as he gets a tad too excited when playing. Reese's foster parents are currently working on basic obedience with him. He can get overstimulated and too mouthy in his play and needs a family who will commit to continuing his training. He would also do best in a home with a fenced yard or a family who is going to actively exercise him.\n\nApply to adopt REESE LONESTAR at WWW. EHRdogs.org!",

She and her sister/littermate were going to be surrendered at a shelter because their young family has lost their house due to Covid.\nMarlee is a BEAUTIFUL, cuddly and sensitive Big Baby Puppy who has lived with young children and who loves other dogs. She and her sister (adopted last night) were not great together; the rescuer who knew the situation agreed that the stress in the house was a factor.\nI'd love a male dog-companion for Marlee. I've been watching her wrestle with Nico, a male Aussie also being listed, the past two hours; they both finally flopped down next to each other on the patio and are snoozing in the sun.u\nMarlee has a very mild-moderate energy level. She acclimated to our environment - which is 2 pulses above a Flatline with no problem at all. She is happy to cuddle and just hang out. She'll be a wonderful fur-friend/companion & support dog for someone or a great family pet.\nGeneral Info - PLEASE READ! *Our $350 adoption fee is based on the cost of rescuing, transporting and vetting each dog; we do not try to compete on prices with municipal shelters whose funds are paid by the city.

He's had a tough start and is searching for a loving forever home. We are working on crate and toilet training.He loves other dogs and children. You cna contact the foster directly on dlc.foster69@gmail.com\nCARE's adoption fee is $250 for dogs/puppies and $100 for cats/kittens and an additional $150 neuter deposit will be required for any animals adopted prior to their spay/neuter surgery (and the deposit will be refunded when the approved adopter brings the animal to his/her CARE vet appointment in COLUMBUS, INDIANA once scheduled). All CARE animals arrive in their forever homes current on age appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, as well as microchipped and spay/neutered (or scheduled for the same).\n\nCARE is an all-volunteer and foster-based rescue organization. We do not have a shelter facility and do not have any employees monitoring inbound applications and emails. Applications are reviewed by each animal's volunteer foster home. It may be several days before you hear from this animal's foster home. Thank you for your patience and understanding as our foster volunteers work to navigate a very high volume of inbound adoption applications.",

Your basic one-of-a-kind rescue pup.\nI am 3 years old and 20 pounds! A perfect age and size, if you ask me. I can be a little shy around new people, but oh boy, do I warm up quick. Ill be right in your lap before you know it! I bond quickly and wont want you to leave might even let you know with a few barks. \nI dont play with toys much and dont know too many commands pretty much all I need is a human to love and a comfy place to sleep. I enjoy being petted once were acquainted, and I walk nicely on a leash but can be a little timid at times.\nI super enjoy coexisting with other pups. Im not much of a player just yet but hanging around with other canines makes me happy.\nIm a cute little guy who cant wait to be a part of your family! A little time to warm up is all I need, and youll soon see how sweet I can be!\nAll my love,\nGB\nRequirements:\nTo ensure that Garbanzo Bean and the children in your life are both safe and comfortable, Garbanzo Bean must meet all children in the home prior to being adopted.\nMedical Information:\nGarbanzo Bean has tested positive for heartworms. Great Plains SPCA covers the cost of confirmatory heartworm testing and general blood work, 30 days of antibiotics prior to heartworm treatment, and the heartworm treatment injections that will kill the adult worms. We ask that as Garbanzo Bean's new owner, you purchase 6 months of heartworm prevention at time of adoption to partner with us during Garbanzo Bean's treatment. Heartworm prevention should be given monthly to any dog, but it is especially important for Garbanzo Bean as it is crucial to ensure they never become infected with heartworms again.\n ...",

            "description": "Meet Marvelous Molly Moo!\n\nMolly is in an IDOG foster home in Bellaire, TX near Houston. Please read ALL the information in her listing before applying for her. If you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for her, please complete our adoption application at http://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application (copy/paste the URL into your browser). If you have completed an application in the last 3 months and meet the requirements for his new home, you can email us at rescue@idogrescue.com and let us know you are interested in Molly.\n\n*AGE: 9 years old (born October 2011)\n\n*WEIGHT: 118 lbs. \u2013 she is on a diet and exercise plan and should weigh 100 lbs. or a bit less\n\n*FENCE REQUIREMENT: A physical secure fence is required. No electronic fence or e-collar will be allowed as we feel this would not set her up for success.\n\n*COAT TYPE: very soft wavy low-shedding coat; she is currently shaved down due to matting when she came in to IDOG. Her new family should be prepared to brush his coat regularly and have her groomed every few months. This is approximately $100 per groom.\n\n*ENERGY LEVEL: moderate to low energy. She would love to be your BFF, your Zoom buddy and your cooking friend. She would also love to be your exercise coach and diet partner.  She loves to go for walk, play fetch and is always up for jumping in the car for some fun.\n\n*DOGS: she LOVES other dogs and has lived with large and medium dogs in her foster home. We feel she would do well in a home with another dog.\n\n*CATS: Her previous owner said she chased cats and could accidentally hurt them. She has a high prey drive.\n\n*KIDS: Molly LOVES everyone and we think she\u2019d be great with people of all ages. However, she doesn\u2019t realize her size and does jump up to say hi so any children in the home should be OK with that.\n\n*CAR: LOVES going for a ride!\n\n*CRATE: she hasn\u2019t been crated in her foster home and does fine. She does whine when she is left alone.\n\n*HOUSE TRAINED: Yes!\n\n*LEASH: Molly LOVES to walk and walks well on a leash. Given her large size we use a harness to allow for more control in the case she sees a squirrel!\nHere's what Molly-Moo\u2019s foster parents had to say about her:\n\nMarvelous Molly Moo is an uber sweet 9 year old Labradoodle who was initially found as a stray in Houston. Her owner found us and made the hard decision to surrender Molly to our care due to the owner\u2019s declining health. She wanted us to find Molly a wonderful new home and that is what we will do!\n\nWant an exercise partner and Zoom buddy? How about a shotgun rider? She will be your immediate BFF! Molly is a happy soul and ALWAYS greets you with a wagging tail  \u2013 whether you\u2019ve been away for 5 seconds or 3 hours. She is like the BFF you have that always make you feel so special because you ARE special to her. She radiates unconditional love and such as easy girl to be around.\n\nMolly LOVES to GO! \n-she is the first out the door to go play in backyard, \n-she is the first one leashed up to go for a walk and \n-she is the first to jump in the car to go for a ride. She jumps up in joy when knows going for a walk. \n\nMolly LOVES\u2026everything and everyone:\n-she loves people \u2013 she would love to be with a family where someone is home frequently as she cries when she is left alone.\n-she loves other dogs \u2013 she would love to have a buddy to sleep next to and to play with and to go for walks with.\n-she loves helping \u2013 whether that be next to you while you Zoom from home or clean \u2013 she\u2019s your side-kick.\n-she loves eating \u2013 she would love to help you cook and will help clean up any food you accidentally drop on the floor. She is doing well on her restricted diet and is rapidly losing the unneeded weight.\n-she loves going for a ride \u2013 she\u2019s the first one in!\n-she loves walking \u2013 she is the first one leashed and jumps up and down when she realizes it\u2019s walk time.\n\nMolly is a grown-up girl and can be trusted to roam the house and not chew anything she isn\u2019t supposed to. She has great house manners. She is very food-motivated and will do anything for a treat. She LOVES to be petted and will lean into you for affection. She just fits right in to your house. Molly would much rather be with her people than by herself and whines when she is left alone. She would do best with someone who is home frequently and a home with another dog to hang out with. \n\nMolly likes squeaky balls  and will chase after them \u2013 kind of like her own game of fetch. She is a sweetheart and LOVES everyone. She wants to be right next to you and is very affectionate. Molly needs to lose some lbs. and loves to walk so the weight is already coming off quickly! \n\nShe recently had surgery to remove a growth on her nose and one on her head \u2013 both were benign. We did extensive testing prior to surgery and everything was normal. \n\nMolly is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and house trained. She just had a dental cleaning. She has cataracts which are not impeding her vision much. She sometimes needs help seeing to go outside to potty in the dark. She is heartworm and fecal negative and on heartworm/flea and tick preventatives.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $100\n\nOUR ADOPTION PROCESS\n\nWe will review your application and let you know if you made our short list of applicants. We base our adoption decisions on what is in the best interest of our dogs. Please note our adoption policies are in place for the safety and welfare of our dogs - your understanding is appreciated.\n\nWe are all volunteers and have jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner. We believe in taking time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the best fit for that dog.\n\nOur adoption process may take 2-4 weeks.\n\n\u2022 You must be approved to adopt before we will schedule a meet and greet.\n\u2022 We expect approved adopters to visit Molly in her foster home within a short period of time of being approved to adopt her.\n\u2022 Our adoption process involves vet and personal reference checks, phone interviews, a home visit, an adoption contract and an adoption fee.OUR \n\nADOPTION FEES RANGE FROM $100 - $750 depending on the dog. The following is a general guide, but each dog is assessed individually. It currently costs IDOG an average of over $400 for basic vet, grooming, and foster care on each dog; that does not allow for the ones who get sick, need surgery, have special needs, or are heartworm positive.\n\nADOPTION FEES:\nUnder 6 months $550 and up\n6 months to 2 years $450 and up\n2 years - 4 years $350 and up\n4 years + $100 and up\nSpecial Needs fee/donation assessed on individual basis\n\nTO APPLY FOR MOLLY, PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE:\nhttp://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He was originally abandoned outside our shelter 4 years ago and adopted to a wonderful family, but sadly due to the arrival of a new baby, his current home is no longer a match for his needs. \n\nReilly is an active boy who would be a great hiking companion and has endless energy. He is currently living with a larger female dog who he loves to play with although since he doesn't share toys well he may be best living as an only pet. We see some Pyrenees, catahoula, Aussie, maybe even some Great Dane in his mix. Though he is large he is a gentle soul for the most part and needs the right person to work with and manage his resource guarding (don't take anything out of his mouth, but he will \"trade\" for a higher value treat. \n\nReilly is still residing with his family to avoid a shelter stay, but has to stay mostly separated for everyone's safety and not able to get as much attention and exercise as he would like and is hoping to find the right home soon. Please submit an application so we can set up an appointment to meet this handsome fellow! \n\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Grey Age: 5yrs 3mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

After ending up in the shelter as a stray for a second time, her owners decided they no longer wanted her in the condition she was in.  Her skin was a mess and her fur had become patchy and dry.  She was thin and needed some major TLC.  From what we can tell, she had been running the streets for some time and we are just happy we found her when we did. \n\nPenny is 50 lbs and is estimated to be 2-3 years old.  She is as sweet as can be! and is such a snuggle bug! You will never find her far from her people!\n\n She has been living in a foster home with 3 older gentlemen dogs and doing very well.  She still has quite a bit of energy and spunk in her but she takes corrections well and knows when to back off.  She is very playful, loving and affectionate.  \n\nShe is also great with young children and for the most part, knows not to jump or knock them over.  \n\nShe is crate-trained and potty-trained & would do best in a moderately active house.  \n\nSince she is still learning her manners a bit, another doggy sibling who would play and tolerate her energy level would be ideal as well. \n\n She has come such a long way in a very short time and we know that the perfect family is out there waiting for their \u201cLucky Penny\u201d.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n-Must have fenced in yard",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Speckles!\n\nNickname: Claude\n3-year-old, 50-pound Lab mix\n\nHouse-Trained: Yes\nCrate-Trained: No \u2013 he has some separation anxiety and has broken out of two crates\nTraining: Food motivated and enjoys training sessions\n\nOther Dogs: Not much on playing, but likes to sniff out and investigate \nCats: Co-exists well with cats\nKids: Unknown, but due to his patient demeanor we think he would do fine\n\nClaude is a loving, independent, outdoorsy lap dog. He adores attention and will get as close as possible to you and begin pawing to get some affection. \n\nClaude has enjoyed roaming around the backyard watching the neighbors and the snow fall. He is currently being treated for heart worm and so his activity is limited, but once treatment is complete and activity restrictions lifted, he would enjoy daily walks and time spent exploring the yard. We recommend a fenced yard as his exploring would take him into neighboring yards if given the chance. \n\nClaude is looking for a home with humans who are home more often than not and who do not mind giving lots of love and attention to this sweet boy!\n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

            "description": "Staff would describe my personality as: Please read Zayda's bio closely. She's a very sweet and smart dog, but she'll need a specific type of home to be successful! Zayda is a very high energy dog. Zayda has not had proper guidance from humanst, so Zayda is prone to jumping on people and acting wildly and overly hyper when introduced to new people. Zayda is very easily stimulated, and sometimes she gets so stimulated that she just bursts with energy and has to run and run and run until she is calm again. When she cannot do that, such as when she is on leash, she will jump and nip and do anything she can to burn off the energy she's accumulated from the stimulation. Her previous family had to return her due to her inappropriate behavior. Zayda will need a family who has experience with very high energy dogs, and who understands how to properly train. She will need to live in a home with another high energy, friendly dog who can help her play appropriately and burn off her energy, and she will need an owner with the time to make meal time a mental exercise for her. Luckily this is very easy with all the different food puzzles on the market! Dog parks will NOT be an appropriate setting for her to burn off her energy, as that would likely be TOO much stimulation for her and have little opportunity to set appropriate guidelines for play. With other dogs I am: Great! I'd need a high-energy friend in the home to help me play. With cats I am: No good, I am too high energy for them. With children I am: Children may be in the picture for me later as I age and settle, but right now I need a home with no children as I am too hyper! Potty-trained: Yes Crate-trained: No Leash-trained: Yes Tricks: Sit, lay down I have the following special needs: I need a high-energy, dog-savvy home! Please read my bio above. All dogs are tested for heartworms and given flea preventatives. They are also tested for intestinal parasites and receive routine dewormings. Dogs are vaccinated against distemper, rabies, and bordetella, spayed/neutered before adoption, and have a microchip. Adoption fees include the initial automated registration of the microchip at the time of adoption.",

            "description": "Meet Halley! Halley is an adorable 7 month old Beagle mix. Halley was brought up to Massachussetts from the south and still needs time to adjust to her new life. Once Halley has had the chance to get comfortable with you she is a total sweetheart! Due to Halley's fearfulness she is looking for an adult only home that is outside of the city, ideally in a more rural or suburban area. Having access to a fenced yard or easily accessible area for potty breaks would be helpful for housetraining due to her fearfulness, so we are looking to send her home to a fenced yard. Halley is looking for a quiet home with a family who can help her learn that new people and objects are not so scary. Halley has shown us that she heavily depends on other dogs to show her the ropes so she must live with at least one very friendly and social dog that will lead the way for her and help her adjust. When Halley is with other dogs she is much more confident, playful and vocal! We do not know how she would be with cats or other animals. Halley does not seem to know any cues and will need some training for basic commands in addition to working to show her that new people aren't so scary. Could this playful pup be a part of your family? This animal is currently up to date on all vaccinations, has been spayed, microchipped and been seen by our vet team. If you are interested in adopting this animal, please fill out our web form, available here: Dedham Adoption Inquiry Form! You can expect a response to your inquiry from a member of our adoption staff within 48 hours of completing this form. Due to our high volume of inquiries, please refrain from calling unless that time frame has passed. If needed, you can reach the Dedham shelter at 617-426-9170 x605. The Animal Rescue League of Boston is currently operating by appointment only Tuesday-Sunday 1pm-6pm. Our Adoption Forward process will start with a phone conversation. Also, be sure to check out our: * ARL Website * ARL Twitter * ARL Facebook * ARL Instagram",

            "description": "Meet Gracie! Gracie is an adorable 3 years old, mixed breed who weighs about 30 pounds. Gracie was brought up to Massachussetts from the south and still needs time to adjust to her new life. Once Gracie has had the chance to get comfortable with you she is a total sweetheart! She loves to cuddle and will put her paw on you to ask for more pets. Due to Gracie's fearfulness she is looking for an adult only home that is outside of the city, ideally in a more rural or suburban area. We are looking to send her home to a fenced in back yard to run around in and have easy access for potty breaks. Gracie is looking for a relatively quiet home with a family who can help her learn that new people and objects are not so scary. At the shelter, Gracie has made many friends and is very playful. We feel that it would be very beneficial if she goes home to a confident, social dog. We do not know how she would be with cats or other animals. Gracie does not seem to know any cues and will need some positive reinforcement training for basic commands in addition to working to show her that new people aren't so scary. If you're looking for a loving, playful dog then Gracie might be the dog for you! This animal is currently up to date on all vaccinations, has been spayed, microchipped and been seen by our vet team. If you are interested in adopting this animal, please fill out our web form, available here: Dedham Adoption Inquiry Form! You can expect a response to your inquiry from a member of our adoption staff within 48 hours of completing this form. Due to our high volume of inquiries, please refrain from calling unless that time frame has passed. If needed, you can reach the Dedham shelter at 617-426-9170 x605. The Animal Rescue League of Boston is currently operating by appointment only Tuesday-Sunday 1pm-6pm. Our Adoption Forward process will start with a phone conversation. Also, be sure to check out our: * ARL Website * ARL Twitter * ARL Facebook * ARL Instagram",

Her son loved the dogs dearly, but is being deployed with the Air Force and so begged the shelter to help him find placement for her and her 11 year old fur sibling (who has gone to another rescue.) They were not bonded. She is a sweet girl who is grieving the loss of her home and her Mom. She would make a great companion for someone who is retired and home most of the time. She is still active and extremely healthy. She has always had excellent veterinary care. Her companion dog was a smaller female and we would recommend a slow introduction to another dog in the home, but we would really love to see Molly be the Queen of her castle!\nPlease note: We only accept adoption applications through our website or in person (Facebook and Petfinder inquiries are not considered applications).",

            "description": "Cobweb and his *spooky* siblings were born at LCR on Halloween! Their names might be spooky- but their personalities are anything but that! They are Hound x Lab x Pitbull pups that we think will mature about 50 pounds. They are typical puppies- active, outgoing, playful, and in need of some basic obedience training and active home that will be attentive to their puppy needs! Cobweb does currently eat out of a slow feeder bowl because he gobbles his food down too fast- and has shown some resource guarding with other dogs. Something his new family will need to continue to work with! Their adoption fee is $400 and that includes they are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Black Age: 0yrs 3mths 0wks",

            "description": "Rocky / Male / 1 Year / 68lbs / Labrador Retriever Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Rocky! Rocky is described as sweet, curious, playful, intelligent, and active. He loves people and is happiest when receiving attention from his family and when he\u2019s outside. He doesn\u2019t have a huge interest in toys yet, but when he does decide to play, he likes to destroy a stuffy or chew on a Nylabone. He would do well in almost any environment outside of the city. He is more than ready for a loving and active family to call his own!\n\nWhen walking down the street, Rocky shows interest in every person that passes him. He will want to greet some people and can get a little bouncy and eager to say hello. If someone has a bag, stroller or something unfamiliar on their person, he may be weary. Often, he will stop and stare at people getting out of their car or a garage door opening. He is very friendly but may need support and guidance on proper introductions. He doesn\u2019t know his own size so may knock over small children during play. Regardless we predict he would love to share a home with respectful children!\n\nStill very much a puppy, Rocky needs to be provided with appropriate places to chew. If he gets bored, he will often grab something he knows he\u2019s not allowed to chew to get your attention. If he can\u2019t be supervised, he will need to be put in a puppy proofed space with safe things to chew. He is a very good boy and can usually be redirected as needed. When left alone he may cry and few times but settles quickly. Rocky is fully potty trained and currently goes outside 4 times a day. Rocky is up at 7am and gets a one hour walk or run to start the day. He has 2 shorter potty breaks during the day, and his second long walk around 9:30pm. He enjoys his crate, and it is his safe space, he will sleep in it during the day and typically puts himself to bed after his late walk. He is still working on going into the crate on command.\n\nRocky is learning proper leash manners but will need continued support. He will pull when he sees/smells something and has selective hearing when he\u2019s distracted. He has made huge progress with his leash skills in the 2 months that he has been in foster care and will even walk on a loose leash for extended periods of time. It\u2019s clear he was not socialized properly with dogs and will bark, jump or growl when he sees them. He needs a strong and patient handler willing to work with him on this. Generally, he just wants to play with dogs but has never been taught how to approach. Rocky has been progressing very well in his reactivity to other dogs and if he is given enough space he will typically not react anymore. Rocky loves to chase squirrels and will need continued work on not learning to chase them while on leash.\n\nRocky\u2019s ideal home would be a detached house, with a fully fenced backyard. He can not be trusted in an unsecured space yet and will need supervision even in the backyard as he is very athletic and can jump very high. He gets very distracted with the sounds of the city and is easily startled. He would thrive in the suburbs or quiet country. We predict he could live with another well-adjusted dog (he lived with them prior to coming to Canada) granted proper introductions are conducted. He will need an adopter with some dog experience and able to work through dog/squirrel reactivity. Rocky is only looking for cat free homes at this time.\n\nRocky is showing early stages of hip dysplasia. He will need to remain on glucosamine and chondroitin supplements throughout his life.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Rocky please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nRocky\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

It's hard to tell exactly how old Sweet Tea is... She has all of her immaculately-white adult teeth. She had puppies; it was obvious she came to us right after weaning.\n\nShe can act like a puppy herself, though, and is amazing to watch She's long and, like a gazelle, bounds across the yard. Back to you, Sweet Tea runs up steps two and three at a time. She loves to go for walks and with her herding instinct needs a little guidance for how to \"heel.\" A very enthusiastic and playful pup, Sweet Tea is also a \"couch dog.\" She'll jump up next to you for lots of snuggles and back rubs, then warms the side of your leg as she circles up just like a puppy to fall asleep... sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nInquisitive enough to nibble on things, she listens and stops when told quietly to stop. Sweet Tea is housebroken and crate-trained for all her meals and snacks, and as long as she potties and has a dog bone treat when it's time to close up for the night, she willingly spends nights there too.\n\nThis girl is looking for her forever home one with someone calm to hang out with, maybe a fellow pup for fun, definitely a fence at least 4 feet high, and lots of love. If Sweet Tea sounds like your \"cup of tea,\" please make an application for her at savinggracenc.org.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "*** Available Wednesday 2/3 *** Scout has been a sweet, loving, playful, affectionate member of our family for the last two months while she finished nursing and weening her puppies. She quickly got to be part of our group of four dogs. She became good buddies w our hound dog Harper. The wrestled and spent time together everyday, and bounced and wagged their tails when it was time to play. While she was with us Scout got comfortable wearing a leash and harness and accompanied my family and one of our dogs on daily walks. She learned that being in a crate is a good thing and settles down quickly. At night she sleeps on her blanket on the floor of our our bedroom. Each night she collects two or three pairs of socks from the laundry and puts them on her blanket without damaging them. She buries her head in her pile of 'stolen' goods and falls asleep. Scout loves to play tug with a rope and chew on bully sticks. She is affectionate with my husband, daughter, and I and loves hugs, pats, and snuggles. Scout is getting used to the sounds and sights of living in a busy neighborhood. Sometimes she is a little hesitant on walks, but being with our other dog helps. She also responds well when we remind her what a good dog she is :). Scout is an all round amazing dog that will fit in well with loving humans. She would like to be around other dogs, either in your family or dogs that visit w friends. She is quite special and will bring a lot of joy to whoever adopts her.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Coming Soon!Papi is a 15 year old, 13 pound chihuahua mix. Sweet little senior boy, Papi, has had a challenging life. He lost his original owner nearly 12 years ago, and was recently rescued by animal control officers from a difficult hoarding situation. We don't know how he survived, but not only did he survive all of that, he did so all while living with a severely damaged eye. Thanks to his wonderful foster and specialty vets, we have learned so much about this sweet boy over the past few months.\n\nPapi's damaged eye is not functional, but it is also not bothering him at all! According to Animal Eye Specialists, he is perfectly happy and healthy with the eye, so it can stay where it is. He will need follow up every six months or so just to be sure it remains stable.\n\nPapi's foster family has learned that he is a happy, affectionate little boy who loves to take walks every day. He will even remind his foster mom if she is a little late starting his walk! Papi is fully housetrained, and is very good about letting his family know when he needs to go out. He loves to lay in the warm grass and watch birds. If left alone, he will dig, but quickly stops when told \"No, Papi\". He loves to sleep in his crate, and sleeps all night with no complaints. Because of his vision, Papi is cautious about going through doors and approaching new things, but he learns quickly with encouragement and love.\n\nPapi is due for his neuter and chip in early February. He will be ready for his new , forever home soon after.\n\nPrior to adoption, all dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm, vaccinated (including rabies, if age appropriate) and microchipped.\n\nAdoption fees for dogs: http://www.svpetproject.org/info/adoption\n\nStay up-to-date on what our dogs are up to by following us on Facebook!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/svpetproject",

            "description": "Gracie / Female / 4 Years / 56 lbs / American Bulldog Mix / Brampton\n\nMeet Gracie! Gracie could be one of the sweetest dogs we\u2019ve ever met. She loves everyone and just wants to be held and cuddled. She is never pushy and always respectful; she\u2019s just happy to be close to her humans. She hasn\u2019t shown much interest in toys yet, but she loves her rope toy! She is described as quiet, sweet, laid back, gentle, happy and affectionate. She is amazing with everyone, a true angel in dog form!\n\nGracie loves meeting new people - and will go right over and offer her head for pets. Recently she had a visit to the vet, and even though she was nervous she was still gentle and calm. She may let out a low growl at the mail person, but she is never aggressive. Gracie hasn\u2019t been tested with children but we predict she would love them. Any kids in the home should be dog savvy and respect her space as needed.\n\nGracie is currently getting 2 walks a day plus additional opportunities to use the washroom. So far that has been enough exercise, but her fosters pay close attention to her energy levels in case she requires an additional walk. She is pretty lazy overall! Gracie has great house manners and never has accidents.\n\nGracie is crated while alone and settles right away. She never makes a sound and just sleeps until her humans let her out. On leash she pulls quite a bit and is very strong. She can only be walked by strong handlers and needs adopters comfortable with consistent redirection. She gets very excited when she sees squirrels and will try and take off after them. She is not fearful of anything, just over stimulated while outside.\n\nGracie doesn\u2019t know many commands but is eager to make her people happy. She will sit on occasion and sometimes stay. She is food motivated so would love to learn more!\n\nGracie\u2019s ideal home would be a house with a backyard, with lots of space to explore outside. She would prefer to be outside of the city. Gracie could potentially adapt to an apartment, granted her exercise needs are met. She loves to explore the outdoors so she would do best with a family that enjoys walking and hiking. Gracie has not be tested with other animals, but does not seem bothered by other dogs. Due to her prey drive, she is looking for a cat-free home. Gracie would prefer a family who is home more often than not and has lots of time to spend with her!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Gracie please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nGracie\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

WE UPDATE OUR SITE DAILY.\n\nMeet Mila!\n\nShe's a 4yo boxer/lab mix who is a total sweetheart! One of her ears is typical boxer & the other ear is more lab LOL. This poor girl has had her share of pups over the years it seems and now she's ready to be a dog and not just a Mom. She is up to date on her vaccines, has been spayed & is HW neg. We're pretty sure she lived with dogs in her past life but doesn't really interact with those in her fosterhome. We have no idea about cats but boxers typically have a fairly high prey drive, so we're not recommending that she be put into a home with one. The shelter said she's ok with kids but we have no way of confirming that here so we would not be comfortable with her going to a home with young children. It took her some time to trust but now loves to snuggle with us! 10 days into her stay here she picked up a bone to chew for the very first time so we're not quite sure if she's just more comfortable or simply doesn't know much about toys. If your schedule has her alone for multiple hrs during a typical day, please don't apply as she simply loves people too much for that. Mila's fully housetrained & is fairly good on a leash too! She's got it all\n\nIf you think you may be a match please submit an app from our site at endingthesadness.org to be considered. Our driving radius for adopters is 2hrs.",

He has a gorgeous subtle brindle to his coat and beautiful eyes. He is a very nice dog, but is super super strong and really needs someone that will keep him active and happy. He loves to fetch his toys. Cider also needs an owner with the patience to teach him basic manners like walking and not jumping. Because of his strength and excitability, no small kids or cats for Cider. He seems to like some of the dogs he's met outside at the shelter, but will definitely have to meet any potential dog or dogs he'd be living with.\n\nAdoption fee includes: microchip, neuter is done, first shots, rabies vac and he is heartworm negative.

Our Nettie with her sweet soulful eyes is a reservoir of affection and gratitude. Nettie may have not had the best indoor life as her calloused elbows suggest but she was LOVED and continues to LOVE. Nettie needs very little to be part of a family. Nettie would appreciate not having to use too many stairs and a soft place to lay her head and maybe a front porch to relax and watch the wonders of being in a family with her people or person...that's about it. Nettie gets along with other dogs but is fine as the only pet. Nettie is known to chase cats....that's right this girl can do a fast trot if motivated.

Kristoff is treat motivated He is crate trained doesn't love it but if he gets his \"cookie\" and soothing music he falls right to sleep for bedtime. He's a little jumper so definitely would need a tall fence He absolutely loves toys and kongs. He's great with kids he does still play bite but we are working on that He gets along with most dogs He prefers laid back dog companions. Kristoff also doesn't love the cold so a sweater is recommended and a little doggie coat for outside:)\n\nLittle Kristoff, with his two other litter mates, were turned in to a rural shelter in Louisiana. Kristoff will receive all needed vetting including neuter and be available soon for adoption\n\noneloveanimalrescue.org\n\nTo be considered as this pet's adopter, please go to www.oneloveanimalrescue.org/adopt.html to complete your application.",

All of his vetting is included in his adoption fee and adopter will need to be in the Dallas area.\n\nWoods is a 8 week old 10lb lab mix who is very sweet and playful. He is crate trained and learning to use pee pads. He does like to talk when he needs something so would be best in a house situation or a home with his person home most of the time. Woods will be neutered, micropchipped, recieve 3 sets of shots and worming as well as recieve his rabies. An adoption fee of $395 applies.

He arrived he was feeling very overwhelmed and nervous, but he is settling in, starting to feel more confident and secure in this big place. Jet is hoping for a kind, calm owner and a home that is steady and predictable so he can relax and enjoy life. He will rely on the bond you build to guide him in the outside world and will need to trust in you not to put him in situations that he can not handle by himself. If people rush in and don't spend time letting him feel comfortable and get to know you, it worries him so he will need slow introductions and patient people. If you go slow and steady he opens up and will trust you. Jet likes playing with other dogs, but can also get worried with new dogs so he is looking for a polite, well socialized dog he can play with. Jet is hoping for a calm gentle person and a calm steady home filled with love!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Jet, please email the behavioral team at kheadlee@wenatcheehumane.org with some information on your current living situation and a phone number.",

She has healed excellently, and her current foster says she is a super easy going girl who loves walks, is housetrained, and likes playing with her cat!\n\nA note from her current foster says:\n\n\"On walks Daisy is not spooked by cars or trucks and is VERY happy to go on walks! She is curious about people, dogs, and squirrels, but does a great job of not interacting or chasing . Daisy walks very well overall. She stops when I stop, and responds quickly to her name.\n\nIn the house Daisy is definitely house trained. She did not whine or bark in her crate overnight, and wants to play with my cat!! Daisy is super patient and gentle (my cat is still getting used to her), when let outside to our fenced in backyard she goes to the bathroom almost immediately and comes right back to the door. She seems to just want to be around me and hangout. Has been super cuddly, but also playful when I want to play\n\nDaisy is incredibly sweet and would make a great fit for someone looking for a companion or a great family dog. \"\nDo you think I am the perfect match for you?

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\n18 POUNDS OF BEAGLE ADORABLENESS!!!UPDATE 1/30/21.\nEighteen pounds of beagle adorableness is easy to love. With velveteen ears, soulful eyes, black and tan fur beautifully balanced, Earl could challenge any movie star dog for cuteness.\nEstimated to be 2-3 years old, he is a quiet little guy at Almost Home. Though he is slightly wary, this small gentleman enjoys calm attention, food puzzle toys, and special treats.\nHe was friendly toward us from the beginning, yet if we tried to leash him, or if he thought we were out to grab him, he would shy away from us. His eyes told us, he interpreted this as capture. With patient convincing, it did not take long for him to understand that a leash isn't a bad thing, and that being petted was kind of nice. His little heart is coming to believe that no one is out to get him, and his trust and confidence builds daily.\nPoor Earl was left abandoned and infected with heart worms before Animal Control picked him up for his own safety. No one came to say he was theirs and take him home. Now that he is with us, we are making sure he can have a healthy happy life. Earl will begin Heart-worm treatment in April.\nEarl would do best in a calm household with patient folks who want to share their home with a gentle dog who needs tender care.\nAre you the person who can give this worthy little dog a chance to have the good life he deserves?\n\nNOTE: All animals are spayed/neutered as soon as practical after arriving at our facility unless there is a medical issue that may cause a delay or they are too young to be spayed/neutered.VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED.

He cannot run too far but enjoys a good wrestle. He lays quietly on his dog bed while his foster mom works from home. He is crate and house trained. He is super food motivated. He weighs about 60lbs and should not gain any more weight for easy of movement.\n\nNow to the story of how he came to be with us and missing his leg. He was found wondering in neighborhood. He had been there about a week with his leg dragging and trying to find food and shelter. Finally someone offered him some help and got him to us. We got his leg amputated as it was a Brachial Plexus Avulsion.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Errol please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.",

She is active and playful and will need an active home. She loves long walks, car rides and cuddles. Ivy has lived in a home before and was absolutely adored, but sadly her mom wound up having to care for her grandchildren and Ivy does not like children. Ivy loves adult people, but children, other dogs and cats are not her thing. Ivy would prefer to be the only apple of your eye. This girl will just make you smile!\nIf you would like to sponsor Ivy while she waits for her new forever home, see: https://www.greyhoundpetsinc.org/support/sponsor-a-dog/\nGreyhound Pets, Inc. - www.greyhoundpetsinc.org - 877-468-7681\nWHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT A GREYHOUND?\nRead Greyhound Pets, Inc.

He is a sweet boy who get along with anyone he meets and loves to play with dogs. He is big, 125 pounds and doesn't realize his size, so he would be best in a family without small children. He is very energetic and agile. He must go to a family with a huge yard (1+acres) to allow him to run and play and it must be fenced with a 6' high fence. He easily jumps the 4' fence at his foster home without touching it. He would love to go to a family with another big dog (but no cats) so they can play. Sherlock is a dominant male, so a home with a female or a laid back male is best. Sherlock has had very limited training, so his new owner would need to be willing and able to work with him on his manners. He currently knows how to sit and down and is working on walking on a leash without pulling. Sherlock is house trained and can be trained to sleep in an extra-large crate.

To apply read about our adoption policies\nhere\nto fill out an application.\nHi I am Mr. Zucchini. I am a very small and sweet guy. I was abandoned at animal control because my original family was moving and didn't want to take me with them. It was a very traumatic experience for me. Once I get to know you I am a real cuddle bug. I like to sleep in the bed with my people, am housebroken, ride good in the car, and just love to be around people. If you would like to meet me please put in an application and once it is approved we can set up a meet n greet.To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Cats have been tested and confirmed negative for Feline AIDS and Leukemia.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thank you for considering adopting one of CARA's Special pets! To apply read about our adoption policies\nhere\nto fill out an application.\nHi Everyone, I am Jimini Crickett and I am quickly becoming a favorite here at CARA. I have the most loving personality and just want to hang out with my human friends. My tail is always wagging and I love to go out and run in the yard. I am not currently available for adoption because I do have heartworms. Some great people like you donated to my treatment so once my skin clears up and I gain some weight I will be able to start that soon. If we find someone great in the meantime who has a really good connection with me and is approved I may be able to go to their home as a foster until my treatment is done. If you think you would like to meet me put in an application today, and once approved we can have them set up a meeting with me. Hope to hear from you soon.To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Cats have been tested and confirmed negative for Feline AIDS and Leukemia. Dogs have been tested for heartworm disease.\n\nOur shelter is located at 42 Deep River Rd in Sanford and is open Tues, Thurs, & Fri from 3pm - 7pm & Sat from 10-2pm (other times available by appointment). CARA's adoption process and online application can be found at\nhttp://www.cara-nc.org/info/adoption\n\nPlease call 919-774-9433, email adoptions@cara-nc.org, or visit www.cara-nc.org for information about this or other pets available for adoption.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me or any of my friends, please visit CARA to fill out an on-line application or e-mail us at adoptions@cara-nc.org.\n\nEvery animal that comes into the CARA program is here because one or more events occurred that led to this animal needing not only a home, but a person or family to love and protect them. Each animal has been loved and cared for by a small and determined group of people who want nothing more than to know each animal is safe for the rest of his or her life. Thank you for looking to adopt!",

Mr. Tank came into our rescue as an owner surrender, and came to us VERY skittish and fearful. He has been in his current foster home for about 2 months, and through patience and kindness, Tank is finally starting to open up! He was not accepting of any kind of affection for about 2 weeks (meaning his foster mom was not even able to touch him), and the foster mom has slowly been introducing affection at Tank's pace, and we are finally seeing him enjoying his affection (this happened about weeks 6 to 8).\n\nHe is pee pad trained, and when he first goes to his new adoptive home, he is going to need to be given a pen with pee pads available, and given lots of time to decompress without a lot of pressure put on him.\n\nHe does co-exist with the other dogs in the house very well, and actually seems to draw a lot of confidence by following the other dogs. For this reason, we would LOVE to see him go to a home with another dog to help continue to build his confidence.\n\nHis perfect home will be a quiet and patient home, one that will go slow with him and let him open up at his pace. We are not recommending children because of his level of insecurity/fear.\n\nHe is going to take a couple months until he is fully comfortable and comes out of his shell.\n\nHe is up to date on all shots, dewormed, and neutered. He has been heartworm tested (negative) and is on prevention. The adoption fee is $250.00 If you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an application.\n\nhttp://www.ajssearchandrescue.org/adoption-application",

Loves to play ball. She loves her treats. Very loving, and smart. She is great with all dogs. We are working on walking with a collar and leash.\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

I'm not a puppy anymore, but I'm only 2 years old, and still very much like a big baby! I am extremely loveable and enormously playful. I would probably be a great family pet, but would do better around older children, as my energy level might be a little bit much for little ones. I would love to find a home that has a great big yard for me to run around in and get out some of my energy. I'd love a busy home with lots of things that I can be a part of, particularly one that receives lots of visitors who I can engage with. I may be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you in public after some time and some training. I could definitely benefit from continued obedience training, as well as potty-training, but I have learned to walk well on a leash and I just can't wait to get a chance to do that with you very soon!",

I would say possibly. She\u2019s run off before but came back 30 mins later ?????\n\nFood aggressive: sometimes growls if another dog comes by her\n\nWalks on leash: yes but needs more work.\n\nRides well in car: needs to be tethered; she\u2019s all over and wants to hang out the window.\n\nDestructive: still a big puppy; mostly has a favorite type of organic bone I found that she is attached too. If she has that she\u2019s fine. (Can pass the info on that along to whomever takes her in)\n\nNeeds a home with a yard: YES\n\nNeeds a home with another dog: I\u2019m not really sure. I\u2019m sure she would enjoy it. I have two others but they\u2019re older. She likes to play.\n\nCan live in an apartment: I would say no due to her energy level\n\nBackstory: someone reached out to me on Facebook about Marley. Her owner is newly pregnant and feels three dogs are going to be tough to manage once the baby arrives. Marley is already spayed and has been well cared for.",

They are very friendly and love attention. They love each other so we want to try to keep them together. It will be a difficult task but would be ideal for both dogs. Phoenix is a 7 year old male Pomeranian. Pixie is a 14 year old female toy fox terrier. You would never know her age as she loves to play fetch with a ball and has quite a bit of energy. Phoenix is a social butterfly and sweet little lap dog. They are both house trained. They are wonderful companions who deserve a forever home. We never want them to go through this again. They will make someone very happy with their sweet personalities. Their adoption fee is $350 for both. They are spayed/neutered, current on shots and heartworm negative. \n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MEETING AND/OR ADOPTING THIS DOG PLEASE DOWNLOAD AN ADOPTION APPLICATION DIRECTLY FROM OUR WEBSITE (www.newbeginningsdogrescue.com) AND SEND IT TO US VIA EMAIL OR TO REQUEST AN APPLICATION PLEASE EMAIL US AT: newbeginningsdogrescue@hotmail.com\n\n",

I was surrendered to the shelter with my brother Elvis because our owners fell ill and could no longer care for us. We refuse to go anywhere without each other! Which means we need to go to our forever home together. Don't let our ages fool you we still have a lot of spunk! We enjoy the company of just about everybody we meet. We have done well with children in our previous home. We are unsure about cats but can be cat tested here at the shelter. If you are intersted in us call our friends at the shelter for more information! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $87.50 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included.",

We refuse to go anywhere without each other! Which means we need to go to our forever home together. Don't let our ages fool you we still have a lot of spunk! We enjoy the company of just about everybody we meet. We have done well with children in our previous home. We are unsure about cats but can be cat tested here at the shelter. If you are intersted in us call our friends at the shelter for more information! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $87.50 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included.",

            "description": "LOVING THE GOOD LIFE:  5 \u2013 6 months old / Currently 33 lbs. \n\nHi, my name is Julia!  I\u2019m a young pup who somehow ended up at animal control.  I am looking forward to finding my furever family in a loving home.\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  There are 3 silly and rambunctious dogs in my foster home, and I do very well with them. I\u2019d really like to have another dog in my new home as I follow their lead and it gives me confidence, so let\u2019s meet (It may just take a day or so to feel comfortable with them) / I get along well with the cat in my foster home.  I\u2019m curious but not aggressive with her, so if you have a cat that likes dogs, let\u2019s meet / I enjoyed the company of the gentle 9-year-old in my 1st short break foster home as well as the kids I met at MM\u2019s that were around that age as well.  We did lots of snuggling, so if you have kids, let\u2019s meet but best no toddlers that I may bump over.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I was shy the first day in my foster home, but they spent a little time with me on the floor and that really helped me warm up and feel comfortable with them.  Now I\u2019m just the sweetest dog with a super soft coat to boot.  I was also shy and timid in my early days at Mostly Mutts - being young and a bit confused from being at animal control, I needed to adjust and feel safe.  I\u2019m quiet in my foster home and they have only heard me bark once \u2013 my foster was giving out treats and I sang for joy about that!   I am friendly and give tail wags now as I\u2019m enjoying life with a great foster family / My energy level right now is 3-5, but I think it will increase as I get more comfortable and even more of my personality emerges.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I\u2019m a pretty smart puppy and so far, I\u2019ve learned the \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, and \u2018come\u2019 commands.  I also greet nice strangers without jumping and my leash manners are pretty good too.  I do sometimes hesitate at doorways but go through them with encouragement / My crate manners were good at Mostly Mutts.  In my foster home, I have good house manners and do not need a crate / After one initial accident, my potty habits have been good in my foster home.  I follow the other dogs and go to the door when I need to go out.  It takes me a few minutes to go potty when I am on my leash, so patience, please.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like to show my family I love them by giving them kisses.  I also love to play tug-o-war and play with plush toys.  Being outside with my people and the other dogs in the home is fun, so let\u2019s spend time together enjoying the great outdoors.  I like to find familiar places to settle down in / I didn\u2019t seem to like the TV in my 1st short break foster home, as it seemed new and confusing to me, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to it.   I would not be happy if I didn\u2019t get the love, training and good care that all dogs deserve.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.\n\nI am looking for a wonderful family to give me a loving home!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

And in addition to exercise, a healthy diet is a must, including plenty of quinoa. Meet Quinoa. This handsome tricolor guy came to PACC as a stray with a buddy who has since been adopted, but now that he's flying solo, he's winning hearts all over the shelter. In play group, Quinoa greeted other dogs appropriately, despite being a little bit nervous due to some lameness in one of his legs. Volunteers say he's a calm-tempered gentleman who wants pets and to be loved. The shelter can be a noisy place for a dog that may be feeling vulnerable or challenged, so Quinoa would love to get into a home of his very home. Quinoa can be a bit picky when it comes to treats, but he especially loves cheese. He's a friendly and affectionate guy who seeks out love and pets and back rubs. After being on his own for so long, Quinoa is very underweight and would love to find himself a person or people who can shower him with affection and help to fatten him up. Quinoa is a total sweetheart who would make for a wonderful sidekick. If this gentle boy sounds like the pup for you, make an appointment to meet him today.",

            "description": "\u2018DISNEY PRINCESS\u2019 THEMED PUPPY:  6 \u2013 7 months old / Currently 20 lbs.\n\nHi there!  My name\u2019s Jasmine!  I was at animal control with my sisters, and together we\u2019re the Disney Princess puppies.  Mostly Mutts rescued us, and now we\u2019re all excited to meet our new families soon and start living \u2018happily ever after\u2019 in a loving home!  \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I love my siblings and got along great and played well with the other big dogs in my short break foster home.  So, I would likely enjoy another dog to play with in my new home.  If you have a nice doggie that would like a puppy friend, let\u2019s meet / I haven\u2019t met kitties yet, so let\u2019s meet / There were two boys in my short break foster home (ages 5 and 8), and I did great with them \u2013 from cuddling to playing, so I\u2019d likely enjoy kids (around that age or older) in my new home, as long as they are gentle with me and best no toddlers that may fall on me.  Let\u2019s meet!\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a wonderful young girl \u2013 active, playful, friendly, and curious.  I view myself as a lap dog and really enjoyed my foster mom\u2019s lap for the week I spent with them \u2013 lol. I was pretty quiet with minimal barking in my foster home and my foster reported that I had pretty good manners for a young pup, so yay me / My energy level is 6-8, so plan on being active with me, so I get the exercise I need to be a happy pup and adult dog.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I\u2019m now in the Mostly Mutts University training program and looking forward to learning lots of new things!  I\u2019ll also want my family to continue my training, so I know everything I need to know to grow up and become a wonderful adult dog, so get ready for some training with your new best friend / I slept through the night in a crate in my foster home and did well in it, though it took a little coercing \u2013 like a treat to get me to go into it.  My crate manners are good at Mostly Mutts too/ My potty habits have been pretty good.  I had a couple accidents before learning the schedule in my foster home.  I understand the concept of going potty outside and just need practice with letting my people know when I need to go out.  I don\u2019t like to go potty outside in bad weather (but what doggie does).  I WILL do it but want to come right back inside.  So, be consistent with my training and I should have it down soon. \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I liked chasing tennis balls and sticks in the yard of my foster home, so a fenced yard where we can play would be nice in my new home.  As much as I like outdoor play, I prefer hanging out inside.  I love to cuddle in my people\u2019s lap, and I am a big fan of my food / I can\u2019t think of things I don\u2019t like yet since I\u2019m so young, but I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t like it if I didn\u2019t get enough love, attention, exercise and training.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.                                    \n\nI am looking for a family dedicated to continuing my training, so I can be my best adult doggie self!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

Since arriving he\u2019s been a ball. \nMatt is about eight months old. He\u2019s thought to be a Rhodesian Ridgeback/Chesapeake Bay Retriever. He has a beautiful chestnut colored coat and weighs 38 lbs., but he will grow a bit more. Matt loves being with people and is affectionate and friendly. Matt has a lot of energy and loves running and playing in the yard. He seems to be dog friendly, but will give chase to cats and would be best in a home without them. Matt is learning how to walk on a leash. He will do great with some gentle training. Matt will also do best in an active house, where he gets to be part of the activities and has a way to expend his energy.  \nMatt is going to make for a super family companion. If you\u2019re looking for a happy and outgoing, young dog to welcome to your heart and home, Matt may be the one. We all fell in love with him the minute he arrived and think you will too!\nIf interested in Matt, please submit an application online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "\u2018DISNEY PRINCESS\u2019 THEMED PUPPY:  6 \u2013 7 months old / Approximately 14 lbs.\n\nHi there!  My name\u2019s Aurora!  I was at animal control with my sisters, and together we\u2019re the Disney themed puppies.  Mostly Mutts rescued us, and now we\u2019re all excited to meet our new families soon and start living \u2018happily ever after\u2019 in a loving home!  \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I love my siblings and would likely enjoy another dog to play with in my new home as I seem to want to play with the ones I see on my walks.  I am however afraid of the big dog that lives in the neighborhood who barks at me, so let\u2019s meet / I haven\u2019t met kitties yet, so let\u2019s meet / I like the 12-year-old in my foster home but am a little mouthy, so best no toddlers that I may play a little too rough with, and of course let\u2019s meet!\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:   I\u2019m described as playful, cuddly, friendly, and very energetic!  I am the runt of my littermates, but I don\u2019t let that get me down as I have a fun and sweet spirit / I have a higher energy level at about 6-8, so I\u2019ll want regular exercise with my family! \n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I\u2019m looking for a family that will teach me everything I need to know to grow up and become a wonderful adult dog!  I\u2019m working on \u2018sit\u2019 in my foster home / Right now I do not like the crate at all \u2013 barking when in it, etc.  Hopefully, you can show me that it\u2019s not a bad place by giving me treats or a nice bone to chew when in it, etc.  Since I\u2019m loud in my crate, an Apartment/Condo type home is likely not a good fit / I\u2019m doing pretty well with my potty training when on a good schedule, but I have had accidents in my foster home, so you will need to finish my potty training. \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like so many things, here is a little list for you:  toys including the stuffed kind, playing, being active with my family, napping, going for walks and socks \u2013 sorry about that last one (lol).  I also love food and will likely do some good growing now that I am getting regular meals.  You see I came to MM\u2019s rather malnourished and weighted much less than my siblings / I\u2019m not a fan of bursts of air \u2013 maybe I just don\u2019t know why they happen, so it scares me.  Also, big dogs barking at me makes me want to get away from them.  Other than that, I would not be happy if I didn\u2019t get enough love, attention, training and exercise.  \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I'm current on my vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.  Since I was malnourished, I came to MM\u2019s walking more on my wrists, but I\u2019ve made a remarkable recovery with just the good nutrition my little body needed!  As I get older, you may want to start me on glucosamine a little early.   \n\nI\u2019m looking for a family that will treasure me and give me a wonderful home, so if you\u2019re ready to raise a great dog, I could be the one for you!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

It was fun to watch him discover life inside a home. The first time he saw the TV in action it was a little freaky but he has adjusted amazingly fast. This guy has the sweetest demeanor, LOVES to romp with his foster brothers and cuddle with his people. He is quiet, friendly and very gentle. T-Bone\u2019s ideal home would have toys, dog friend(s) and lots of ear rubs.  This guy is super smart he already sits and uses the dog door.  We have had no potty accidents since the first night and he does well in his crate. If you are looking for a loyal family member, \nT-Bone is your guy.",

It went like this:\nDear Abby,\nWill you love me forever and ever if I adopt you?\nSincerely,\nYour Future Mom/Dad  \nI have an answer for you! I sure will love you to pieces forever and ever if you will love me forever and ever too?! \u00a0\nMy name is Dear Abby, but I let all my dear friends call me Abby. I am an 8 years young, 57lb. black lab mix darling. I am a smart girl who is house trained, crate trained, good on a leash, and I even know how to \"sit\" and \"come\" when you ask me nicely! I adore humans of all ages and get along with cats. I do not enjoy sharing my loves with other canines, so I want to be your only dog. I am so fabulous you won\u2019t even want another dog!  I mean look at this face: I melt hearts for a living with it!  I would be so happy lounging with you in our house, apartment, or even the cab of your big rig! I am definitely a lady who loves to lounge, but I also have adorable spurts of playful energy! I have a slight limp in my left leg from some old nerve damage, but it doesn't slow me down a bit! I just say that, like any good model, I have a signature walk. I am a sweet, loving, fun, happy girl who is wagging up a storm thinking of our life together! I will be your dearest friend for life if you fill out my adoption application and promise to love me for all of it!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $75 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

The wounds were old and the good news is she didn't need surgery but the bad news her infection was drug resistant. The vet was able to find a new drug that has turned Bonnie around and now off her medication she is ready for her own family. We don't know much about Bonnie accept the shelter and the vet office all say she is very sweet and loving. 3 years old and 47 lbs. She has had no issue with other dogs at the vet office but we haven't had her evaluated by our trainers yet. If you would like to meet Bonnie please contact AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com It is best if you have Bull Terrier experience.",

Zoey was in much need of a dental and had an abscess on her back that was opened. 7 years old and need getting the much medical she needed. Zoey has had the cyst removed and a dental but due to her age we have to wait a couple of weeks before she is spayed. Zoey most likely would do best in a seniors home since we think that is all she knows but we do have our trainer evaluating her to see how she is with other dogs.

Must own home to apply\nHW-\n\nHannah was found at a car wash in Georgia one Saturday and had no identifying tags or a microchip. It was a very busy business district, so the person who found her took her home and began the search for her family. After weeks of trying to find her owner, Hannah was surrendered to us. She was heartworm positive and so we treated her for that and she has fully recovered! She is a wonderful girl who loves children and does well with other dogs. She knows some basic commands and is not hyper. She is very loyal to her person and would be very trainable to be an emotional support dog.\nPlease note: We only accept adoption applications through our website or in person (Facebook and Petfinder inquiries are not considered applications).",

            "description": "I have an Adoption Pending and will be going home soon.  But I hope you will consider one of our other wonderful dogs in need.  Thank you!\n\nSydney is a sweet 9-10 month old retrieve mix who found her way to our rescue through a shelter in Mobile County, AL. The story goes that someone called the shelter and said they found this puppy and asked that the animal control officer come and pick her up.  Was Sydney a stray or was she this family's dog?  Some folks say they found a dog when they no longer want them or cannot find homes for puppies because owner turn-ins are the first to be euthanized.  Strays at least have a 5-10 day hold, which gives time for a rescue to step in and rescue the dog.  And we at SGRR were more than happy to say YES to rescuing Sydney!\n\nSydney will certainly turn heads when you are out and about with her.  She has a beautiful white coat with a few golden patches.  She walks fairly well on a harness but does pull a bit when on a slip lead.  We imagine recreational walks were not part of Sydney's former life.  She is somewhat reserved when first meeting new people and in new situations.  She would do best in a calm home without a lot of comings and goings.  Sydney enjoyed playing with one of the vet tech's 3-year old daughter who is gentle and dog-savvy, but a home with active children would not suit Sydney well.\n\nSydney weighs about 50 lbs.  She has been brought up-to-date on vaccinations, was spayed, is heartworm negative, and has been micro-chipped.   She will be ready to come north in mid-February to be directly adopted - right in time to be someone's Valentine!!  A physically fenced yard is preferred for Sydney.  We know she will be an amazing pet - it will simply take her some time to get used to new things.  \n\nRescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.        \n\nIf not yet approved for adoption, please visit our website to learn more and to submit an online application:     http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com/adoption-info1.html  \n\nPlease DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com   \n\nThank you!\n \nABOUT OUR RESCUE\nBefore being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. \n\nThe information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.\n\nSGRR ADOPTION FEES - Effective May 1, 2020  (subject to change)\n  \n  $750    Puppy - up to 6 months              \n  $650    Young 6 months - 6 years            \n  $550    Senior 7 - 9  years                       \n  $450    Senior 10 years and older          \n \n  $550    Young Special Needs                \n  $400    Senior 7+ Special Needs                \n\n$1000    Young Bonded Pair                   \n  $900    Senior 7+ Bonded Pair         \n\nA contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their SGRR dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. \n\nMost of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  \n\nPlease be a ray of light for this Sunshine dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a Sunshine dog.\n\nPlease visit our website at: http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com  to learn more about our rescue and to make a Donation to support Sunshine Golden Retriever Rescue.  \n\nTHANK YOU!",

I'm a real good boy and get along with with all my foster fur siblings, cats and dogs alike. Although I don't like sharing my toys all too much, I take correction from my humans well when it comes right down to it. I also take cues from other dogs if they don't want me to be in their space. I could live with older, respectful kids, but because I don't like my feet touched, little kids might not understand not to touch them. I'm completely housetrained and will hold it until I'm let outside, and will even let you know when I need to go. I don't need to be put in a crate when you aren't home, because although I'm not fond of being left alone, I'm still not destructive as long as I can't get to the garbage. I love eating, so the garbage just calls me right over to it when my humans aren't home and tempts me to get into it. Who knew the garbage could talk, right? But that's an easy enough fix I would think. \n\nFoster mom says I'm the perfect combination of playful and lazy. I love to play fetch with a ball, toy, or stick, and will happily bring it back to you for another toss. I really enjoy stuffies too! I walk well on a leash and would enjoy going on walks with you. I'm also a good boy on car rides. You wanna snuggle on the couch during rainy days? I'm good at that too! At the end of the day I'd love to sleep in bed with you if it's not too crowded, otherwise I'll find a comfy spot on the floor. Do you have a spot in your heart and home for a guy like me? \n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

I am a cute, meatbally pitty mix, and 7 years old. I came to the shelter with my friend Champagne after a housefire had left us homeless. The staff describe me as a doll. I love to love and enjoy the company of anyone. I am good with children, other dogs, and will be cat tested soon. Did I mention I am housebroken too?! I know, its one of the perks of adopting a senior. I like going on walks and enjoy rolling in the grass when the snow is melted. I am not a snow girl at all. I love the warmth so be prepared to share you blankies, bed, and lap with me. If you would like to take me home, please fill out an application, call the shelter people to state interest and/or schedule an appointment to meet me! I promise you wont be disappointed!",

            "description": "Let us introduce you to Janey, also known as Lilbit! She is a beautiful little girl full of life and love. She LOVES to cuddle and play! She would do great in a home with other dogs that also like to play. She's non-aggressive towards cats, but she definitely wants to play with them. If you have a kitty that doesn't like a dog nose up the bum, she may not be a good fit. She's mouthy when excited, but doesn't bite, so kids just need to be aware of that and she should be fine with them. She's learned to sit on command, but she's stubborn, so \"come\" is not a command she enjoys obeying. She's got that little dog bark that just goes on and on when she is offended by being locked in her crate, or is certain an intruder is anywhere near, so an apartment would not be a great fit. She would do best in a fenced-in yard with a fence higher than 4 ft because she's a jumper and she climbs like a cat. She LOVES to sleep with people. If a people is sleeping nearby, she's sure to be on top of them! She is house trained, but she's still young, so she gets into trouble like eating or chewing on things she shouldn't. She likes to dig trenches and she's a powerful chewer for such a little dog! She's about a year old and roughly 25 lbs. She will be spayed February 16th and can go to her forever home after that date.",

Strict sanitizing guidelines due to COVID19 prevent us from allowing visitors without an appointment.\n\nSusie came to the shelter as a stray. She was very shy and unsure at first but wanted to trust people. She would bounce around and want to play but when people interacted with her she would get defensive and hide. Susie has come a long way in her time with us. She will now approach people and has positive interactions. Susie is friendly and playful with other dogs and we feel like she will really bound strongly with her people once she is in a home but will need a home that is willing to continue work on socialization. Susie loves toys and playtime so a fenced yard would be great for her. A home with no small children would be best as she continues to learn and gain confidence.

            "description": "Oslo is definitely man's best friend! At 10 weeks old this handsome, roly poly Lab mix puppy already weighs 18 pounds, and we suspect he will be about 65 pounds when fully grown. Oslo's foster family tells us that he has a crazy and great personality, and is the sweetest and most loving dog they have ever met. He is playful and energetic, but also knows when it's time to calm down and relax with a nice belly rub and a nap - hopefully on someone's lap. He is happiest when he is with people, and is a world class snuggler. Oslo loves his toys and balls, and has a silly way of stretching all the way out on the rug by your feet to gnaw on his chew toys.\n\nCurious and confident, Oslo has a twinkle in his eye and pep in his step as he bravely explores his surroundings. He is very friendly and enjoys meeting new people and other dogs, regardless of their size. Oslo is a smart little boy and is doing well with his potty and crate training. He definitely has opinions of his own, but is so sweet natured and easy going that he is easily redirected and brought back to focus. His enthusiasm for fun and games can sometimes get the better of him, but all is forgiven when you look into that beautiful little face and see the love in those cute eyes. Oslo will make a wonderful addition to any family, and will be a loving and devoted companion.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

Thank you!\n\nSweet Kelly was found running loose in a Louisiana Parish.  As stunning and loving as she is we were amazed that no one came to claim her at the shelter.  Oh, if only these dogs could tell us their stories... \n\nKelly is a medium-sized girl weighing about 47 lbs.  She is estimated to be about 1-2 years-old and may be a Golden mix.  Whatever it is that went into her DNA, it surely produced one beautiful dog!  She came to our rescue as a shy dog, but has now warmed up as she receives attention and affection.  Her inner happiness has started to emerged and we are thrilled to see her wanting to frolic and play!  Presently, her activity is restricted as she completes her heartworm treatment.  But her cute personality is still showing through.   She has become a big fan of belly rubs and is becoming more comfortable each day. \n\nKelly would do well with another dog in her new home or she can be the apple of her human's eye in a single pet home.  She walks pretty well on a leash and rode nicely in the car.  She is very sweet and is so gentle when taking treats from your hand.  In the care of a loving adopter, she will continue to blossom into a happy little bundle of fun. \n\nKelly has been brought up-to-date on vaccinations, is spayed, micro-chipped, and is under treatment for heartworm. For the first year of adoption, she must be given the brand name Heartguard for her heartworm preventative.  After that, a generic may be considered.  Kelly is scheduled to come north from AL, to be directly adopted into her new forever home, mid February.\n\nRescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.        \n\nIf not yet approved for adoption, please visit our website to learn more and to submit an online application:     http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com/adoption-info1.html  \n\nPlease DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com   \n\nThank you!\n \nABOUT OUR RESCUE\nBefore being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. \n\nThe information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.\n\nSGRR ADOPTION FEES - Effective May 1, 2020  (subject to change)\n  \n  $750    Puppy - up to 6 months              \n  $650    Young 6 months - 6 years            \n  $550    Senior 7 - 9  years                       \n  $450    Senior 10 years and older          \n \n  $550    Young Special Needs                \n  $400    Senior 7+ Special Needs                \n\n$1000    Young Bonded Pair                   \n  $900    Senior 7+ Bonded Pair         \n\nA contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their SGRR dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. \n\nMost of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  \n\nPlease be a ray of light for this Sunshine dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a Sunshine dog.\n\nPlease visit our website at: http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com  to learn more about our rescue and to make a Donation to support Sunshine Golden Retriever Rescue.  \n\nTHANK YOU!",

According to the vet it appeared he had been attacked by multiple dogs. The vet cleaned him up, shaved him down and gave him his rabies shot. They estimate his age to be a year and a half and is mid-sized dog. Reminder...he has been completely shaved while healing - but Sam has a Border Collie coat of long, silky hair. Sam will be fully vetted while in our care - including neuter and micro-chip. Sam is precious and a lover! He gets along with most of the dogs he interacts with, he is in Haven's doggy day play everyday. Sam will need someone willing to spend a little time working with him (he's young) - he just has had no training of any kind - so he likes to jump on you, and he pulls on a leash. Just like 90% of all of our dogs ? The great part is - he's a nice and friendly dog! Interested in meeting him, please fill out our online adoption application and we will contact you to arrange a meet and greet.",

So sweet!  \n\n Liam is a 4 1/2 year old sable GSD looking for an experienced home who can provide him with consistent daily work and training.  The best things about Liam can also be the most challenging.  He really is a great representation of what we like to see in the breed, but this also means the average home is not going to be the best fit. \n\nRequirements of a home for Liam include:\n*Experienced owner who has had shepherds or another working/herding breed dog\n*No children\n*No other dogs \n*No cats\n\nLiam cannot be left unsupervised in the yard for long periods.  He is not a porch dog and over time will find a way to go on field trips if left to his own devices.",

            "description": "Meet Abi! She\u2019s an adorable (we think BOL) Bassett/Terrier mix. Whatever she is, she is adorable. She\u2019s about 18 months old and weighs about 28-30 pounds. She is spayed, up to date on shots and on monthly heartworm preventative. Abi is also house trained and crate trained.\n\nAbi was rescued from the side of the road and no one came forward so the finders have been caring for her and reached out to me for help finding her a furever home. She is very sweet but very strong but because of their age, they think she\u2019d do best in a home with someone younger and better able to handle her energy and strength. They think Abi would do best in a home by herself. She\u2019s a girl; she wants all the attention. She has done fine with the smaller dog in the home. They are fed separately and crated when no one is home. She does fine with the older grandchildren (8+ years old). She is fun loving and rambunctious and can knock over smaller two foots accidentally.\n\nFrom Abi\u2019s rescuer: Abi is a mixed breed I saved from traffic on the side of the road. I tried diligently to find her owners. Facebook, all pet websites, animal shelter, posters all around the location where she was, neighborhood websites, and door to door. After not having success with that I took her to the vet and got her shots, all tests, etc and she was very healthy. She was crate trained and basically house trained. She learned very quickly to ring the bell to go outside. She still loves her crate and sleeps there every night. At first she was very territorial about her food so she eats outside and sits for her food. I have a video of that. I decided to train her to be on a leash and to do the basic commands. She will sit, heel, come, come forward and turn, swing out and return to a sit beside me. She will stay for 10 minutes or more but is not so secure in that and sometimes moves. She\u2019s a puppy still so easily distracted. She will go from sit to down and stay. She is 27-30 pounds of solid muscle when she runs thru the house she could easily cause me to tumble down. Her energy is not always non-stop, but she needs to play outside and fetch. She needs to walk around the block several times. She is very lovable and will sit beside me on the couch or on the back of the couch right by my head. She still chews a lot so I have many chew toys which she likes to hide. She is a great pet but too much energy and too heavy for 2 older people so we really want us to find her another home.\n\nIf you are interested in Abi, please complete our application.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/4Paws1HeartDogAdoption",

After a bit of time on the road, she is learning leash walking and basic dog manners. She is very treat driven and would be very easy to train. Zelda is very nurturing and especially kind to others. She has been micro-chipped, spayed, and is up to date on shots. Let us know if you can provide a home for this very sweet girl.",

He's a big puppy who thinks he's a much smaller puppy, and will try to crawl into the best seat in the house... your lap! Angus will need an adopter who understands that puppies require some work and training to become well balanced adults. Angus will also need a home without small children, as he has been known to guard his food. To turn that into a positive, Angus is extremely treat motivated, so positive reinforcement training with treats should keep his interest and help him learn new skills and commands. He's a rough player with other dogs (think \"wrestlemania\"), so we are trying to find Angus a home where he is the only dog. With some more canine socialization, he may be able to have a friend in the future. Angus hasn't met a person he hasn't wanted to shower with love, he just needs to find his match!\n\n Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Weight: 54lbs Age: 0yrs 11mths 1wks",

She walks great on the leash and is very smart, has some basic obedience skills. Zelda can play well with large breed dogs, but she does not share her home space with them, her love of family is never ending and she prefers to be an only dog . Zelda can play with other dogs her size when she is in a neutral space away from her home. We adore her and think she is going to make some lucky family complete.",

            "description": "Meet Luna! Luna is around 8 months old and 37lbs. She was brought into a rural Alabama shelter because she \"got too big\".  She has stunning eyes and a beautiful merle coat.  She likes other dogs and is friendly with people too. \n Luna loves to be wherever her people are and is content doing whatever you want, whether that\u2019s lounging on the couch or going for a hike outside. She has a calm house presence and is always thrilled to see her people whether you\u2019ve been gone for an hour or less than a minute, she\u2019ll be right there to greet you with her tail wagging. \n She has wonderful manners, she doesn\u2019t really jump up or get mouthy and she isn\u2019t pushy when it comes to food. She enjoys chewing on bones and has no problem giving them up to you and will gladly take a belly rub or pets over any treat. Though you do need to put your shoes away so they don't become a dog chew.\n She\u2019s doing wonderful with house training and is calm and quiet in her crate but isn\u2019t really a fan. And will shred her blankets in the crate.\n She is a lovely little girl that just wants to be loved, some nice toys, a soft bed and tasty treats are a definite bonus though.\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

Animal control officers were called and obtained custody of him before he came to our campus. Even though Rad had a rough start, he is a super cool dog who absolutely loves life! He is very energetic and loves to run around with toys and other dogs. His ideal home would have a big yard with a solid fence to keep him safe (He is a jumper!). Rad would also do best in a home without small children. Rad is good on a leash and would like someone who would take him for walks and outings to dog friendly places. Rad loves to learn and explore. Unfortunately, his experience being left outside and then living in a kennel environment has not allowed him to learn to not have accidents inside. Rad needs someone who is patient and forgiving to help him get over this unfortunate habit. Rad is very sweet and playful. He is looking for a home that will offer him the love and patience he needs to develop appropriate habits. \nPlease send us a message if you are interested in adopting this sweet boy!",

I think he\u2019s still a puppy as he has many puppy traits & I think he also has some growing to do yet too...\n\nHe is good with other dogs - very playful, unknown about cats, good with kids, strangers and all adults. He should be supervised around kids under 6yrs old as he can jump up and still play bite. He is very puppy like for 1yr old. He weighs about 35#.\n\nHalf Pint does fine in the kennel while you\u2019re working or at school and for overnights. He does stir for a little bit before setting in & laying down. \n\nHe likes to chew, so bones or durable toys are his favorite! He needs some training still: basic obedience, continued work on potty training (still some accidents - hence why I think he\u2019s still a puppy) & he has very limited leash experience. \n\nHe will need a patient and consistent home that can train him into the well rounded adult dog they want him to be!\n\nCome meet this handsome boy today!\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (cash/card only) \n\nFoster to call: Jaime 651-324-1105 or Jaime3369@gmail.com\n\nDue to the recommendations about the coronavirus, we are not able to have group adoption events at PetSmart.  We are, however, allowed to do individual adoptions so if you are interested in this pup/dog, please contact the foster listed above to set up a meeting.  We look forward to continuing to save dogs with you and will resume group adoptions as soon as we can.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home & truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption; discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, & 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11am - 3pm at Lakeville PetSmart (located by Hy-Vee just off 160th & Pilot Knob) & Burnsville Petsmart (located just off Hwy 35E & County Rd 42 by Chianti Grill).\n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies temporarily into your home and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If you\u2019re interested, please email our dog coordinator: jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you! You can also apply to be a foster home on our webpage! In the upper left hand corner there\u2019s a drop down tab with the link for canine foster home. Just fill it out online & submit! We will get back to you as quick as we can.",

            "description": "Look at this cute little man!! Bear was found as a stray in Texas, at only 4 months old! Bear is likely a Beagle/Sherpherd mix. With almost any rescue though, breed is just a guess! Bear is only 4 months old, (still a baby!) and 25 lbs. He will likely be about 50lbs full grown. \n\nBear\u2019s floppy ears and squishy face are to die for! This poor little guy was found sitting in a puddle on mud in the pouring rain. He has since been with one of our Texas rescue partner\u2019s fosters, living the dream! He is a typical, bouncy, silly puppy! \n\nWith any rescue, moving from a shelter to a foster to an adoptive home can be very confusing. When an adopting family is sensitive to the challenges of change and acclimation for these dog's, the transition is far easier. A home with a very loving and nurturing family that understands that blossoming takes time would be perfect home for a rescue dog. Socialization, pure love and belly rubs is a gift to a dog that is undergoing a life change. Given the time and space, these dogs shine. \n\nFarfel's Rescue has found over time (we've rescued more than 3,000 dogs over 15 years of rescue) that families that attend level 1 group training classes or address individual challenges at home with one of our approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers keep their dogs for life. Dogs that do not get proper training and socialization have a much higher risk of developing behavioral problems. There is a bonding that occurs through the training process that can't be duplicated. It also teaches behaviors that enable a dog to go out into the world with excellent manners that create a very respectful relationship between dogs and their humans. It is for all these reasons that Farfel's isn't willing to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to create this training relationship. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/ force-free trainers in your area. \n\nBear is up to date on his vaccines, and we have requested he be neutered prior to transport. If he is not neutered prior to transporting to Colorado, Farfel\u2019s Rescue will cover all costs of his neuter. Neuter is required to finalize any adoption!\n\nBear is arriving on transport in Boulder on Wednesday 2/3/2021. Applications are currently being accepted for our wonderful pup. If interested in this gorgeous, very cuddly/sweet and loving best friend, please fill out an application completely at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/ and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving puppy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.",

Our shelter partner absolutely adored him and is excited he made his way to Underdog!\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

If you like to walk and throw a tennis ball but also don't mind lounging around on the couch with a large lap dog... he wants to come home with you! Gets along with other dogs, walks well on a leash but is very strong, knows how to sit, and really just wants to be loved. His foster mom says that Banks keeps her feet warm while she drinks her morning coffee and works on her laptop, he always wants to be close by! He is a snoozer though too. He will go into a crate and take a long nap whenever needed! Don't let his size fool you, he is a giant teddy bear! Not a huge fan of cats so would do best as an only child or with one other pup playmate!",

Will chase cats but good with rabbits, good with most dogs although he is vocal so meet and greet is a must.   Good with older kids, does not like toddlers & erratic movements, can't blame him.  Kiddie pool is required!\nShots are being updated mid February so adoption must be local. \nAdoption fee $150",

Your vet and two references will be called.  A virtual home visit done. Once approved a meet and greet at the farm will take place.  If all are in agreement and the animal has received its NH health certificate an adoption contract will be signed and adoption fee paid.  \nAdoption fees for dogs are $450. for adults over 12 months, $500 for puppies 12 months and younger.  Fees for seniors, special needs or harder to place dogs will be determined by our Board of Directors.\n All dogs will be altered when adoption is finalized, up to date on age appropriate core vaccines, negative for parasites, heart worm and lyme tested if 6 months or older, microchipped and have a current health certificate.  \nProof of a basic obedience course completed is part of our adoption contract within six months. \nOur descriptions are based on shelter evaluations, input from foster homes and interactions with our volunteers therefore are in no way a guarantee of temperment. \n\n! Please know we practice Covid-19 guidelines for mask wearing and social distancing.  Only approved applicants are allowed to meet our dogs outdoors at this time.

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

He had chronic dry eye (which can be very painful) in his left eye that went untreated for a long time. He had permanent scarring on that eye..we put medicine in his eye every day, hoping for improvement.  Sadly, it didn't happen. The only alternative was was to remove the eye..no more pain for this boy! Total improvement with his personality! This good boy has been neutered, enucleation of the left eye, DHLPP and Rabies vaccines, dewclaws on hind legs removed, microchipped and Heartworm/Lyme tested. He is Lyme positive and is on Doxycycline for 1 month. To adopt this special boy, please go to Apet4u2.com and fill out an application!???",

            "description": "Meet Blue. Blue is a 4yr old very energetic and happy dog. He came in with Pepper the Blue Heeler. He gets along very well with her but were not sure about other dogs. His previous owner said he liked other dogs but we can't guarantee that. We think he would probably be a little too much for a cat .\nHe is a really nice boy and he would probably do okay with a proper introduction with other dogs.  We think he would do  okay with kids probably 10 and older. \nHe is just a very energetic dog. Which is to be known for this breed. \nBlue is UTD on vaccinations, Microchipped, and Heartworm tested.",

I go potty outside as long as you get me out when I let you know I have to go. You can't wait until a commercial comes on when you're watching your favorite show, so I hope your remote has a pause button. I get along with respectful kids, who are a bit older so they don't torment me, cats, and even other dogs. I don't really play with others, but I can live peacefully with just about any dog. I'm not fond of being in a crate, but once I know I'm going to be in there because you have to leave, I just go to sleep until you come home and let me out. \n\nSpeaking of sleeping, that's how I spend most of my days now that I'm a bit older. But, let me tell you, while I'm awake I have a habit of eating anything on the floor, so please make sure it's all picked up for me when you bring me home. That's another reason I probably shouldn't live with really little kids, I suppose. I would make a perfect lap dog for someone, and I promise to keep you warm on those chilly winter nights. I do have a fuzzy raccoon toy that I enjoy playing with for a few minutes at a time, and I like to think that I'm pretty cute while I do! At night my foster mom let's me sleep with her, and she lifts me up on her bed since I can't get up there on my own. Hopefully soon I'll be sleeping in bed with you!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

He has been in the rescue since that time and has known nothing but love since then. He loves to play with other dogs in his foster home, both large and small, and does well with them. He also shares a foster home with a couple of school age children, who he loves to play with. He may like to race around playing with toys but also loves to cuddle with his foster mama. He is very attentive and is always trying to make eye contact with his humans. As the siblings were found without a mother present we can only make a guess at breed and adult size.\nHe is crate trained and doing great at potty training. He knows sit and is learning stay and lay down. He would do best with an active family.\nKit is in a foster home with other dogs and school aged children that he does well with.\nDue to Kit's young age we are looking for a home where any children are over the age of 5 and someone is home most of the day.\nPlease consider making this handsome boy a member of your family and contact us to arrange to meet him. More information about the adoption process and an adoption application can be found at https://almosthomepetrescue.org. An application form can be found on the website: https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1 and is required to be approved for any meet and greet and adoption as Almost Home Pet Rescue is a foster based rescue.\n$150 adoption fee covers spay/neuter surgery, heartworm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, micro chip and registration, wormer, flea and heartworm prevention while the dog is in our care.",

She\u2019s 45# of love & sweetness and is full grown.\n\nSnuggles got her name because she LOVES to snuggle (but isn\u2019t pushy). There\u2019s no air gap between her and her person. She has been lacking human attention before coming to rescue & now she just can\u2019t get enough! She loves to just hang out with you on the couch for quiet evenings watching your favorite tv marathons or a movie. \n\nShe is good in her kennel (crate trained) when you\u2019re at work/school and for overnights. Snuggles does really well with her 2 resident dog friends. Unknown about cats. She is great with all age kids. Quiet girl; not a barker.\n\nSnuggles is a gentle dog, mellow & just loves endlessly. She would love a home where affection never gets old and maybe multiple people in the home to give it to her!\n\nSnuggles loves long walks and does very well on a leash. She doesn\u2019t have any aggression issues (food or leash), no anxiety (even though she\u2019d love to be glued to your hip, but she can wait while you\u2019re away). \n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for that perfect, mellow & affectionate dog to join your family, look no further than Snuggles! She can\u2019t wait to meet you so contact her foster mom today! \n\nFoster to call/text: \nAmy 651-815-3423\n\nAdoption Fee: $350 (cash/card only)\n\nDue to the recommendations about the coronavirus, we are not able to have group adoption events at PetSmart.  We are, however, allowed to do individual adoptions so if you are interested in this pup/dog, please contact the foster listed above to set up a meeting.  We look forward to continuing to save dogs with you and will resume group adoptions as soon as we can.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home & truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption; discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, & 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11am - 3pm at Lakeville PetSmart (located by Hy-Vee just off 160th & Pilot Knob) & Burnsville Petsmart (located just off Hwy 35E & County Rd 42 by Chianti Grill).\n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies temporarily into your home and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If you\u2019re interested, please email our dog coordinator: jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you! You can also apply to be a foster home on our webpage! In the upper left hand corner there\u2019s a drop down tab with the link for canine foster home. Just fill it out online & submit! We will get back to you as quick as we can.",

She learned so much and settled in wonderfully in the short time that she\u2019s been with us and is going to be a great dog!\n\nHannah does great with dogs, kids snd cats but needs lots of slow introductions. She would be better with older children because she gets too excited and has knocked them over.\n\nHas a weak back left leg healing from FHO surgery . She will need PT and strengthening exercises - and can\u2019t do full exercise yet. May never heal properly and may always have a limp\n\nHannah was originally found as a stray in Mississippi. Therefore her age and breed are a COMPLETE mystery to us, the MS rescue we work with, and both the MS vet and our NH vet. We avoid making any guesses. We have to label them as some breed on petfinder, so please take this breed as a compete guess (guess by 2 licensed vets). \n\nHannah is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines (distemper, parvo, boardatella, and rabies), and has 2 recent health exams. Hannah goes home with a VT state health certificate which certifies by a legal veterinarian that they are healthy at the time of adoption. Hannah has been dewormed and has 2 negative fecals at the time of adoption(1 prior to entering NH/VT, and another negative fecal before adoption.) Hannah is on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.  \n\nHannah has been getting lots of socialization with dogs, kids and cats.  \n\nHannah\u2019s adoption fee is $500. The fee is based on our cost to spay/neuter, vet transport, deworm, \u201cget healthy\u201d, re-check their health at our NH vet. 100% of the fee goes to our non profit rescue and helps cover the cost of the puppy and helps the next puppy in need. \n\nDue to limited resources we are only responding to people who fill out our adoption application \n\nTo apply to adopt:  https://www.secondchanceranchrescue.com/apply-to-adopt",

He was nervous at first but let us patch him him up and is now close to the end of his road to recovery! Orchard is reserved and calmer guy that enjoys keeping a similar lifestyle. He would make a great companion for someone that also likes to keep a calm home environment. He still loves getting to go for long strolls in nature or the park, exploring everything there is to explore! After that you'll likely find him sun bathing in his favorite bed or curled up to his person for some love! If you're ready to be Orchards person, come on by and spend some time with him today!

He came from a home in WV where he and several other dogs had been neglected and not very well cared for or socialized. Despite his background, this little guy is the sweetest little thing ever and loves being held and cuddled. He is still working on his potty-training skills but will need more reinforcement in that area. Skeeter is not super-playful and is very content to watch his foster siblings play and frolic about, however, he will join in on occasion. Si is a very mellow little guy and is very quiet and respectful. He is fine with the other dogs and cat in his foster home, but he would also thrive as the only dog in the home where he could have all the love and cuddles to himself. Currently fostering in Howard, OH, in Knox County. Out-of-state adopters are welcome, however, must be willing to come to Ohio to get him.

            "description": "Meet Si! He is an adorable 7-year-old Pomeranian who is just full of energy. He came from a home in WV where he and several other dogs had been neglected and not very well cared for or socialized. Despite his rough beginnings, Si is a complete sweetheart, however, he still freaks out when foster mom tries to pick him up, so he will need a patient adopter who will be able to allow Si the space and time to bloom into his best self. Also, due to his background, he is not completely potty trained, so his adopter will need to continue on working with him on that as well. He loves to eat, and play and has LOTS of energy, but one of his favorite past times is sleeping up in the big bed with his people. He gets along well with the other dogs and the cat in his foster home. Si is currently being fostered in Howard, OH, in Knox County. Out-of-state adopters are welcome, but please be prepared to come to Ohio to get him. Applications may be submitted via our website: www.sophiasgracefoundation.org",

            "description": "We found Nemo, and Dory too! \n\nThis dynamic duo have embraced the \"just keep swimming\" motto! Nemo and Dory are both very happy and friendly mutts! Dory is round and her tail is always wagging! She makes the cutest little snorty noises. Nemo is a peppy, friendly and curious, guy who is always up for anything. These two are instant mood boosters and will make their new family entertained and smiling! Besides, whats better than a new mutt, than 2! \n\n* HERE'S WHAT THEIR FOSTER HAS TO SAY! *\n\nDory and Nemo are the sweetest senior pups! They are mellow, easygoing, and independent. They are both motivated by love pets, hugs, kisses, and praises vs treats. They both love to be held and petted. They are always so happy and cheerful with their tails wagging very fast when I talk to them and take them out for short walks or hanging out in our backyard! They get along well with our 3 dogs and enjoy being part of a pack.\n\nDory is low maintenance and loves to cuddle on the couch. She is always so happy to play with Nemo in the backyard and snuggle at night together even though they both have their own bed next to the another. However, they end up on the same bed snuggling during the night and in the morning, I wake up to the cutest snuggle bunnies! Dory is unable to see but her hearing is enhanced and she follows my voice with ease. She's unaffected by her seeing impairment and she is not afraid of the unknown elements. In fact, she loves to explore!\n\nNemo is very interactive. He loves being my helper in the kitchen and loves following me throughout the day around the house or his eyes are following me around the room from his booster seat. He loves to give me kisses throughout the day. Nemo likes to play with our 2.5 year olds male terrier and he has mastered going up the stairs while staying at our house. He's still learning how to go down the stairs so I do need to carry him down. He does have a slight sight issue and needs a little extra time to familiarize himself with his surrounding but once he's set, no stopping him!",

            "description": "We found Nemo, and Dory too! \n\nThis dynamic duo have embraced the \"just keep swimming\" motto! Nemo and Dory are both very happy and friendly mutts! Dory is round and her tail is always wagging! She makes the cutest little snorty noises. Nemo is a peppy, friendly and curious, guy who is always up for anything. These two are instant mood boosters and will make their new family entertained and smiling! Besides, whats better than a new mutt, than 2! \n\n*HERE'S WHAT THEIR FOSTER HAS TO SAY! *\n\nDory and Nemo are the sweetest senior pups! They are mellow, easygoing, and independent. They are both motivated by love pets, hugs, kisses, and praises vs treats. They both love to be held and petted. They are always so happy and cheerful with their tails wagging very fast when I talk to them and take them out for short walks or hanging out in our backyard! They get along well with our 3 dogs and enjoy being part of a pack.\n\nDory is low maintenance and loves to cuddle on the couch. She is always so happy to play with Nemo in the backyard and snuggle at night together even though they both have their own bed next to the another. However, they end up on the same bed snuggling during the night and in the morning, I wake up to the cutest snuggle bunnies! Dory is unable to see but her hearing is enhanced and she follows my voice with ease. She's unaffected by her seeing impairment and she is not afraid of the unknown elements. In fact, she loves to explore!\n\nNemo is very interactive. He loves being my helper in the kitchen and loves following me throughout the day around the house or his eyes are following me around the room from his booster seat. He loves to give me kisses throughout the day. Nemo likes to play with our 2.5 year olds male terrier and he has mastered going up the stairs while staying at our house. He's still learning how to go down the stairs so I do need to carry him down. He does have a slight sight issue and needs a little extra time to familiarize himself with his surrounding but once he's set, no stopping him!",

With those long slim legs & tiny body he sure acts like he was just born :) \nThis sweet little boy is about 1yo, maybe less. He was rescued from a high kill shelter where he was abandoned skin & bones weighing just 17 lbs, scared and confused. But nothing that good food, TLC and a warm bed can\u2019t fix. He was healthy and happy in no time, playing with toys and chasing balls. Lil Bambi is now ready to leave his safety nest and off to a life adventure with his new forever family. He can still be shy, the world is such a big, new & scary place for him, but with some patience and trust  nothing that can\u2019t be overcome together. He is hopeful for a loving, patient and kind family. Another dog his size to play with would be a big plus. His breed is unknown. He has long legs and a face of a mini boxer, but at only 20 lbs. Bambi is vaccinated, microchipped & neutered. Still learning how to potty outside but getting a good hang of it. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAgain, if this ad is running, the dog is available. If interested please reply with detailed information about the adoptive family or submit an adoption interest application below. \nTax-deductible adoption fee applies. Ask for details. \nhttps://www.kingofheartsfoundation.org/adoption-application.html\n\nVideo link 1 of Bambi: \nhttps://youtu.be/HwiXp5r1AMk\n\nVideo link 2 of Bambi:\nhttps://youtu.be/q_NW0M7HBGA",

Hank was a very good boy over Christmas while in a foster home for he Holiday. He loved snuggling on the couch with his foster family on top of the Holiday blankets. His favorite toy from Santa was a super chewer ball. He is the perfect mix of wanting to play for a bit to get some energy out then snuggling on the furniture with you for the rest of the night. If you're interested in meeting Hank, please contact us at foster.adoption@cincinnatianimalcare.org !\n\nMy adoption comes with a leash, collar, durable dog toy & up to $100 of training. \n\nFor more information about me please visit: \nhttps://ws.petango.com/webservices/adoptablesearch/wsAdoptableAnimalDetails2.aspx?id=45218212&css=&PopUp=true",

            "description": "Kyle is a 1yr old, 34# Heeler mix that came to us from an overcrowded shelter in Oklahoma. \n\nHe is good with other dogs per the sending shelter, but the foster home doesn\u2019t have other dogs. He sees other dogs during walks and does fine & did just fine with everyone on the transport. Unknown about cats.\n\nKyle LOVES people and would be good with older kids.  He can get very excited and jumpy when meeting nee friends and could scratch/knock over a small child unintentionally. Also, he is very mouthy when he plays & a young child make think he\u2019s trying to bite.\n\nKyle isn\u2019t a barker. As far as being kenneled: he will go into the kennel with a treat; but he has VERY high separation anxiety (he hasn\u2019t has good kennel experiences prior to coming into rescue). He would do best in a home where someone is around most/all of the time so he doesn\u2019t have to be kenneled or alone for long periods. The anxiety might lessen over time as he get more situated into his home and with his high energy needs being met on a regular basis. He does sleep in his kennel, in our room at night - since we are in the room he does ok & he\u2019s also there when we leave, but he gets anxious when we leave. \n\nKyle is still adjusting to home life vs being stuck in a kennel in a shelter. He did have a few pee accidents the first 2 days in foster care, but not poop accidents - he whines to go outside for those. Kyle did get an upset tummy from starting a quality food once in rescue, so swapping foods should be kept minimal to avoid diarrhea. No food aggression issues.\n\nHe walks fine one a leash but does pull a bit when he sees another dog, rabbit, squirrel or human. He\u2019s excited to see them!\n\nKyle is a smart dog, but it\u2019s obvious that nobody\u2019s taken the time to train him as he doesn\u2019t know any basic obedience commands just yet. Foster home is working on SIT, COME and DOWN. \n\nKyle does like to chew, so giving him lots of the proper items to chew on like bones and power chewer toys will help keep him from chewing your shoes/boots and other plastic items or things in his crate. He is learning these items are not chew toys & what HIS toys are. He does also put his front paws on the table and would take some food if it was close enough to the edge. He is learning that this is not ok to do. Life is so different in a home vs 4 concrete walls or running free as a stray, but he\u2019s adjusting and learning, it just takes time. This smart boy is catching on quick with consistent foster parents!\n\nKyle likes to get up on the comfy couch and bed (they\u2019re sooo soft!), but this is just something that can be taught to stay off of if you don\u2019t allow that in your home. \n\nHeeler mixes tend to be higher energy & need an active family, older kids to play and wear them out, another dog in their home or maybe someone in the home that runs/hikes on a regular basis to get the exercise they crave. He could probably easily jump a 4\u2019 fence (he\u2019s athletic) and would make a good agility or frisbee dog if you\u2019re interested in that!\n\nKyle is a friendly, sweet and energetic dog who just needs some training, consistency and stability in his life. Could you be the one to put all the pieces together for this adorable guy?  \n\nAdoption Fee: $350 (cash/card only) \n\nKyle is with a new foster with our rescue so please contact our Dog Coordinator for more information: \n\nJaime 651-324-1105 or Jaime3369@gmail.com\n\nDue to the recommendations about the coronavirus, we are not able to have group adoption events at PetSmart.  We are, however, allowed to do individual adoptions so if you are interested in this pup/dog, please contact the foster listed above to set up a meeting.  We look forward to continuing to save dogs with you and will resume group adoptions as soon as we can.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home & truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption; discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, & 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11am - 3pm at Lakeville PetSmart (located by Hy-Vee just off 160th & Pilot Knob) & Burnsville Petsmart (located just off Hwy 35E & County Rd 42 by Chianti Grill).\n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies temporarily into your home and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If you\u2019re interested, please email our dog coordinator: jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you! You can also apply to be a foster home on our webpage! In the upper left hand corner there\u2019s a drop down tab with the link for canine foster home. Just fill it out online & submit! We will get back to you as quick as we can.",

The local animal shelter found Brody whimpering in the desert, carrying around a toy in his mouth.  They traced Brody's owner via his microchip, and the owner told them, \"I don't want the dog anymore!\"\n\nAt The Fuzzy Pet Foundation - (TFPF), Brody has been getting plenty of love and attention.  His teeth were nicely polished, and he has been gaining back his weight.  We are helping Brody to open up more to humans as he is understandably hurt and traumatized.\n\nBrody is a very loving boy who would do best in an adult-only home.  He is afraid of certain men. While he will tolerate other dogs, he prefers to be the only pet, too.  He thrives on routine and would love a guardian who spends a lot of time inside the home.  Brody gets attached to people very fast -- he follows around our volunteers, whimpers to let us know he is feeling insecure or scared.  He LOVES to go on walks and will carry around his toy everywhere he goes!",

I was found being kicked around at a gas station in Houston in July 2020.\nTwo nice ladies saw me, scooped me up and took me to a doctor.  I was so emaciated the doctor didn\u2019t think I would survive the next few days.  Well, thanks to my wonderful and caring foster, I did!  I have put on weight and I am feeling so much better.  \nI have some issues with my rear legs and knees but I\u2019m on medications that helps \nwith that.  I love to play with my toys and roll around in the grass.  With a proper introduction I am good with other dogs.  \nMy foster thinks I\u2019m really special.  I\u2019ve been through a lot and it\u2019s been a long haul getting well.   And I love my foster mom bunches I but can\u2019t wait to find my very own forever home!",

            "description": "Sugar is a 9 year old Maltese and spent her entire life as a breeding machine in a puppy mill. As a result she is fearful of humans, terrified of strangers, frightened by loud noises and quick movements. She has however, come a long way towards socialization. Sugar knows her name. That being said she is still working on coming when she's called.\n\nSugar is a very smart little girl which might be a reason why she can be stubborn. She'll look at you when you call her name but will only come to you if it suits her. Sugar is very treat motivated. If she knows you have a treat she will come over right away every time you call her. \n\nSugar is working on her potty training. Again, here's where her stubborn streak shows. She knows she's supposed to potty outside but if it's too cold, too wet, too sunny, too dark, too whatever she will choose to potty inside. She knows what a pee pad is for and will use them if she's in the mood. Otherwise she will either pee right next to the pad or pee wherever the mood strikes her. \n\nSugar LOVES toys and will hoard them by loading them in her crate. This brings me to another subject. The crate. Because Sugar was a mill dog she is never locked in her crate. Being locked in a crate gives Sugar great anxiety and she will bark incessantly. The door is always open allowing her to come and go as she pleases.  \n\nCrate potty training is not an option. Because Sugar lived  24/7 in a cage she has no problem going potty in her crate and then walking, rolling and laying in the mess. Because of anxiety and stress of being kenneled Sugar will shred a pee pad placed in the crate with her. Sugar has tasted freedom and refuses to give it up. \n\nSugar knows the doggie doors and loves going in and outside as she pleases during the day. She is living with multiple dogs of multiple sizes and gets along well with them all. \nI have no idea how she would get along with cats or other pets.\n\nIf it seems like I'm showing Sugar in a bad light that is not my intention. I just want anyone interested in adopting Sugar to understand she is not a normal dog with normal responses to normal situations. Sugar is a puppy mill survivor and as such she will need extra patience, extra love and extra time to decompress and open up. She will need someone who is home more often than not.  She needs someone who will allow her to remain unkenneled if left alone.\n\nBecause of her fear and small size Sugar needs a home with no small children and no medium or large dogs.  . \n\nSugar is a flight risk so she needs a yard with a physical fence. ABSOLUTELY NO ELECTRIC FENCES! \n\nBecause I will take Sugar back if the placement doesn't work out only homes within a 100 mile radius of Rockford IL will be considered. \nIf you can meet all of the requirements above and feel you would like to adopt Sugar go to www.tinypawssmalldogrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Sugar's adoption fee is $350.00\n\n\nAny questions, please contact my foster mom at :  kmehalko@att.net",

Although that seems like a long time away, we thought it would be a good idea to begin showing this sweet happy boy to the world. Johnny loves to play and loves to throw his toys in the air. He loves to lay beside his humans and wait for his belly rubs. His foster family said that because of his injury he will always walk with a limp but he does it with a smile and it doesn't slow down his happy go lucky attitude. Johnny will be a wonderful addition to his lucky family!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, race on over to our website at gulfcoastgreyhoundadoption.org and complete our adoption application.

            "description": "There are so many lilies for a gardener to enjoy. There are Asiatic, Oriental, Calla, and Lilly of the Valley, just to name a few. But we prefer this canine variety. Lilly is a 3-year-old 52lb female Hound/Boxer mix. She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. She is crate-trained and nearly housetrained. She is learning to walk on leash with the aid of a prong-collar and she wears a backpack, too. She knows all her basic commands.\n\nLilly is affectionate but shy, playful and puppy-like, eager to please and, highly food-motivated. You could say that her fondness of food is both a problem and a solution . . .\n\nLilly is learning \u201chouse-manners.\u201d She has a few habits that her people are working to curb, including: counter-surfing, garbage-eating (indoors) and digging (outdoors). But, an ounce of prevention is also worth a pound of cure. So, Lilly isn\u2019t left unsupervised and food isn\u2019t left out. Lilly\u2019s finer qualities include playing well with submissive dogs and getting along with children\u2014although with as much energy as she has, she\u2019d pair much better with a teenager in need of a running partner than a youngster with no dog-sense. And, while looks aren\u2019t everything, Lilly is a striking girl with a white body and a bridle head divided by a white stripe. We think she\u2019ll win you over given half a chance.\n\nTo adopt, please submit an application at this link: http://form.jotform.com/form/11880935459 or visit www.pottersangelsrescue.org to view additional adoptable dogs and for more information. Adoption fees apply and vary by age:\nPuppies $400 (12 months and younger)\nDogs $375/$300 (13 months to 5 years/6 to 8 years)\nSenior Dogs $200 (9 years old and over.)",

They had purchased him as a puppy from a breeder in South Korea.  He is a purebred yellow Labrador Retriever currently being fostered in Long Beach, CA.\n\nTerry is extremely friendly, docile, and well-trained.  He does not have a single mean bone in his body.  He gets along well with other dogs and has been around kids all his life.  Terry also knows how to sit and shake, and has been described as an ANGEL by all our veterinarians and volunteers.\n\nTerry has a clean bill of health.  He is neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccines.  He also has up-to-date blood work. \n\nTFPF is looking for a stable, loving family for Terry. We are hoping to find an adopter who is experienced with the Lab breed and who has the time and resources to care for him for life.  \n",

Adoption inquires can be made here: info@tfpf.org \n\nTerry is four years old, and he was brought to The Fuzzy Pet Foundation - (TFPF) when his family could no longer care for him.  They had purchased him as a puppy from a breeder in South Korea.  He is a purebred yellow Labrador Retriever currently being fostered in Long Beach, CA.\n\nTerry is extremely friendly, docile, and well-trained.  He does not have a single mean bone in his body.  He gets along well with other dogs and has been around kids all his life.  Terry also knows how to sit and shake, and has been described as an ANGEL by all our veterinarians and volunteers.\n\nTerry has a clean bill of health.  He is neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccines.  He also has up-to-date blood work. \n\nTFPF is looking for a stable, loving family for Terry. We are hoping to find an adopter who is experienced with the Lab breed and who has the time and resources to care for him for life.  \n",

I am super sweet and absolutely love to be hugged and snuggled! I also like to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I think I'd be happiest in a home with slightly older children who can be aware of my personal space sometimes. I also seem to have a significant prey drive and would prefer a home without any feline companions. I think I'd make an excellent choice for a first-time adopter, as long as they have a great big yard for me to run around and play in, I may even be suited for the farm life! I could be happy in either a busy or a quiet home, as long as I get the chance to interact with visitors from time to time because I love to meet new people. I could benefit from some continued obedience training, but I do appear to be mostly potty trained and have become quite proficient with leash walking.",

I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I am a very good boy, but can be a little bit anxious sometimes. I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I think I'd do best in a home with older children, if any, who can respect my space at times. I do appear to have a strong prey drive and would not like to be placed in a home with any feline companions. I'd be a good pick for a first-time owner, as long as they have a big yard for me to run around and play in. I would definitely prefer a quiet lifestyle to a busy one, but I do love to meet new visitors so feel free to invite your guests over. I could benefit from continued training, including potty-training as I haven't quite mastered that yet, but I do know how to walk on a leash like a good boy and I can't wait to go on lots of walks with my new family.",

I was found living in a large drain in a canal in New Orleans and saved by the fire department. I'm very good with other dogs, but I am still quite skittish and afraid because of everything that I've been through. I would definitely benefit from an experienced owner who can patiently help me learn how to work through the trauma that I have been exposed to. I have been tested around cats and I did quite well! I'm really a very sweet boy who just needs some love and some time to get used to my new surroundings. I would love nothing more than to have a great big yard to run around and play in at my new home. A quiet lifestyle would suit me best, but I do love meeting and greeting new people from time to time. I would benefit from further training but I do appear to be mostly potty-trained already!",

I'm a sweet boy who just loves attention, even though I may come across as shy at first. I'm known around the ranch for my winning smile and my friendly spirit. I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size, and I think that I would make an excellent family pet in a home with slightly older children, who can be aware of my size. I'd love nothing more than to have a big yard all of my own to play in at my new home. I think I'd prefer a more quiet lifestyle, but that doesn't mean that I can't wait to get to know you and all of your friends. I could benefit from continued training, but I do appear to have a good understanding of potty-training already! I just love to go on nice long walks with some of my favorite staff here at the ranch but aside from that, my most favorite activity is absolutely cuddling up on a couch with someone who wants to give me tons of snuggles!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Casey! I was rescued by an animal shelter in Louisiana before arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. I was found living in a large drain in a canal in New Orleans and saved by the fire department. I'm very good with other dogs, but I am still quite skittish and afraid because of everything that I've been through. I would definitely benefit from an experienced owner who will be patient and can help me learn how to work through the trauma that I have been exposed to. I like to play with other dogs, regardless of size. I would prefer to live in a home with adults-only who can be aware of my anxieties and will have patience with me as I learn to be more secure. I also appear to have a prey drive and would not like to be placed in a home with any feline friends. I would just love to have a great big space to run around in at my new home, and while I would prefer a quiet lifestyle, I am also pretty friendly when meeting new visitors. I could benefit from further training, but I do appear to be mostly potty-trained and I have gotten pretty good at walking on a leash as well!",

I love to run around and play! I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I am a super sweet little pup with TONS of energy who's looking for a home with an active family and a great big yard to run around and play in whenever I want! I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I'm enormously friendly whenever I meet anyone new, whether it's a new dog or a new person. Because of my high energy level, I think I'd do best in a home with older children who will be able to understand my excitement. I'd be a great pick for a first-time adopter, as long as you have a yard for me! I'd be happiest in a busy home where there are lots of activities for me to do and to be a part of. I could benefit from continued training, but I do appear to have a basic understanding of potty-training already! I love to go out on long leashed walks and I may even make an excellent running buddy if you're looking to get back in shape!",

I am a sweet boy but I can be a little bit timid around new people and new situations. I would probably do best in a home without young children, just because of my size and my cautiousness. I would be an excellent pick for an experienced dog owner who can show me how to be more comfortable with new surroundings. While I think that I would be a good fit for any living circumstance, even an apartment, I think I would prefer to at least have a little bit of land to roam around on. I'd most certainly prefer a quiet lifestyle to a busy one and while I'm friendly with new visitors, I can also be protective if I perceive that there may be a threat. I could absolutely benefit from some continued training, but I do seem to have a good understanding of potty-training already! I love to go on nice long leashed walks here on the ranch and I can't wait to get to start doing that with you really soon!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Tonkan! I was rescued in Puerto Rico before arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. I am a very playful pup, but I don't seem to have a good understanding of quite how big and strong I am! Because of that, I'd probably not be best in a home with small children who I might hurt accidentally. I like to play with other dogs, but can be selective at times with who I choose to play with. I do appear to have a prey drive and should not be placed in a home with cats or other small animals. I would definitely do best if placed with an experienced Shepard owner, who is familiar with my strength and energy level. I would love nothing more than to have a great big yard to run around and play in at my new house. I would probably be happiest with a busier lifestyle with lots of activities for me to participate in. I am always looking for more attention, and when not given it, I tend to be quite vocal. I am also very visitor friendly, so if you like to have guests over, I will try to be the very best host. I could definitely benefit from training, but I do appear to be potty-trained and love to go on long-leash walks, but I'm definitely a puller!",

I am a super loving little girl who just loves to steal all of your attention. My favorite activities include playing fetch and running around in large open spaces. I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I think I'd make an excellent family pet and would probably do very well in a home with young children. I do seem to have a prey drive, so I would prefer a home without any feline companions. I think I'd be an excellent pick for a first-time dog owner, as long as they have a great big yard to run around and play in and get rid of all of my extra energy. I'd be happiest in a busy home with lots of visitors who I can engage with. I may even be the type of pup that you could bring out and about with you as you go about your daily adventures. I could benefit from further training but I do already know some of my commands like sit. I do appear to be potty-trained already and I love to go on long leashed walks. But my absolute favorite activity is always to cuddle up on the couch next to someone that I love!",

I love to run around and play! I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I love to play with other dogs, no matter how big or small they may be. I am a very sweet and loving girl who thrives on attention. I think I could make an excellent family pet and would be great with children. I do appear to have a strong prey drive and would prefer to be in a home without cats. I think I'd be a solid pick for any first-time adopter, as long as they have a great big yard for me to run around in. I think I'd prefer a quiet lifestyle to a busy one, to match my low energy level, but that doesn't mean that I won't want to play with you from time to time. I love to meet new people and am very friendly. I think that I could benefit from some continued obedience training, but I have seemed to have gotten the hang of potty-training and I am quite proficient at walking on a leash.",

I am a staff favorite here at the ranch, probably because I'm so sweet and well-behaved. I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I think I would make an excellent family pet, particularly in a home with young children. I do appear to have a prey drive, and wouldn't be very happy in a home with feline companions. I'd be a great pick for a first-time dog owner, as long as you have some land for me to run around on! Aside from a big backyard, a busy home life would be nice, as I like to be involved in as many things as possible, all the time. I'm super friendly with everyone that I meet and may even be the type of pup that you want to bring out and about with you as you do your daily activities. I could benefit from some further obedience training, as well as some help with leash-walking, but I do appear to be mostly potty-trained already. I do love to go on long walks, play a rousing game of fetch, or snuggle up on the couch next to someone that truly loves me!",

Adoption inquires can be made here: info@tfpf.org \n\nTerry is four years old, and he was brought to The Fuzzy Pet Foundation - (TFPF) when his family could no longer care for him.  They had purchased him as a puppy from a breeder in South Korea.  He is a purebred yellow Labrador Retriever currently being fostered in Long Beach, CA.\n\nTerry is extremely friendly, docile, and well-trained.  He does not have a single mean bone in his body.  He gets along well with other dogs and has been around kids all his life.  Terry also knows how to sit and shake, and has been described as an ANGEL by all our veterinarians and volunteers.\n\nTerry has a clean bill of health.  He is neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccines.  He also has up-to-date blood work. \n\nTFPF is looking for a stable, loving family for Terry. We are hoping to find an adopter who is experienced with the Lab breed and who has the time and resources to care for him for life.  \n",

Sam needs time to get used to you and then he is your best buddy. Laps and lots of playtime are his favorite daily activities. He is good with other dogs and likes to play with canine buddies. Sams not good with strangers entering in your home and will bark at them . Putting him away when strangers come in may be best as he is protective of his home. We are looking for a wonderful home for him with a fenced in yard ( required ) and maybe a dog friend in the house. He is very good motivated and eager to learn, which will make him very easy to train!! The possibilities are endless with this guy! Please go to stlsdp.org to fill out our online application .",

Before Holly came to BRBCR, she lived with her family and three other dogs. Holly was purchased from a breeder. Holly bonded with the people in her household, but unfortunately was aggressive to an older smaller female dog. Over the last two years, things became progressively worse between Holly and the other dog. The family had to keep all the dogs separated and rotate them, which became difficult over time, and the owner sought the assistance of a rescue to find a good home for Holly.\n\nHolly is house trained and vocal when she needs to go out. She wants someone to walk with her into the yard which is good because she kind of likes to dig. She recalls very well, walks on a leash nicely, and knows basic commands (sit, down, stay, come, leave it, etc.).\n\nIf you are a proponent of crate training, you should know that Holly does not like being in crates, and whimpers when she is crated. However, she has needed to be crated because she cannot be left unsupervised with other dogs. Currently, there is usually someone at home all day, so we have not needed to utilize it too much. Other than aggression toward other dogs, we have not observed any serious problem or behaviors.\n\nShe is a particularly good alarm dog as she barks at anyone walking past our home, but easily quiets when you command her to stop. She loves to play and catch things, especially balls, and she is quite good at it. She spends most of her day curled up near me while I work, and she is pretty quiet and laid back.\n\nHolly does not get along well with other dogs. She exhibits the same behaviors in her foster home that she had in her previous home. Therefore, Holly will only be adopted to a home where she is and will be the only dog. We have a cat and she seems ok with him. Although, I have not observed Holly around small children, she should not be adopted to a home with small children. We have a teenager and she would be fine in a home with older children. We have a fenced in yard, but she likes to dig and needs supervision.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Holly, please fill out an application on our website (www.BRBCR.org) and then contact her foster parents, Princy Doss and Scott Fullen at dossfullen@outlook.com. All potential adopters are required to have a home visit prior to placement of one of our rescues. Holly's adoption fee is $300, and we offer a two-week trial period when you adopt one of our dogs.\n\nPlease note that we only use our website (www.BRBCR.org) and PetFinder to list our available dogs. Contact us through these two sites only. We are not associated with any other listing websites.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!",

He is a purebred yellow Labrador Retriever currently being fostered in Long Beach, CA.\n\nTerry is extremely friendly, docile, and well-trained.  He does not have a single mean bone in his body.  He gets along well with other dogs and has been around kids all his life.  Terry also knows how to sit and shake, and has been described as an ANGEL by all our veterinarians and volunteers.\n\nTerry has a clean bill of health.  He is neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccines.  He also has up-to-date blood work. \n\nTFPF is looking for a stable, loving family for Terry. We are hoping to find an adopter who is experienced with the Lab breed and who has the time and resources to care for him for life.  \n\n",

She has spent the last several weeks being a wonderful mama to her puppies, but now she is ready to put parenthood behind her and find a game winning home to call her own.

            "description": "No, the Feather puppies can't fly, but they sure are cute! These roly poly puppies are snuggly and sweet. We think they could be Lab and Terrier mixes. Mama Feather is on the smaller side at 30 lbs but we don't know who dad is, what breeds these pups are mixed with, or how big they will get. Bristle is affectionate and very people oriented. He's playful but also enjoys his cuddle time and will snuggle with you all day. Bristle is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org.

Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "GO PACK GO! These cheeseheads are the Lambeau pups! Around 2 months old, they promise to give endless puppy kisses and lots of love to their new forever families. Mama Lambeau is a beautiful Hound and Boxer mix who weighs around 45 lbs. Their dad didn't stick around, so we don't know what else these cuties might be mixed with, but they look like they could have some Hound and Terrier, including Pit Bull Terrier, in them. They seem to be on track to be at least as big as their mom when full grown. Reggie is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

She is working on not jumping up on people for attention and being mouthy during playtime. Feather is fostered with another dog and gets along great with him.

            "description": "No, the Feather puppies can't fly, but they sure are cute! These roly poly puppies are snuggly and sweet. We think they could be Lab and Terrier mixes. Mama Feather is on the smaller side at 30 lbs but we don't know who dad is, what breeds these pups are mixed with, or how big they will get. Bird is very sweet and loves to follow you. She also loves her food and is eager to please. Bird is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "GO PACK GO! These cheeseheads are the Lambeau pups! Around 2 months old, they promise to give endless puppy kisses and lots of love to their new forever families. Mama Lambeau is a beautiful Hound and Boxer mix who weighs around 45 lbs. Their dad didn't stick around, so we don't know what else these cuties might be mixed with, but they look like they could have some Hound and Terrier, including Pit Bull Terrier, in them. They seem to be on track to be at least as big as their mom when full grown. Lombardi is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt.

She has spent the last several weeks being a wonderful mama to her puppies, but now she is ready to put parenthood behind her and find a game winning home to call her own. Lambeau is a sweet, cuddly girl. She gets along with all dogs, big and small. If you are interested in meeting Lambeau, your first step is to submit an adoption application on our website. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog.

            "description": "GO PACK GO! These cheeseheads are the Lambeau pups! Around 2 months old, they promise to give endless puppy kisses and lots of love to their new forever families. Mama Lambeau is a beautiful Hound and Boxer mix who weighs around 45 lbs. Their dad didn't stick around, so we don't know what else these cuties might be mixed with, but they look like they could have some Hound and Terrier, including Pit Bull Terrier, in them. They seem to be on track to be at least as big as their mom when full grown. Chmura is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application.

Dot was a stray rescued by Maltese Rescue California and is currently staying with her foster in Tucson, AZ. She would do best as an \"only dog\" because she gets jealous and will growl at other dogs if they are in her space.  She is a fear biter if picked up unexpectedly.  Her foster is working to stop this behavior.  We don\u2019t know how she gets along with cats. She is housetrained and walks well on a leash. She knows basic commands and learns very quickly. An ideal situation for Dot would be a small child free, quiet home. She needs someone with the time and patience to make her feel safe and secure. It takes her a little while to relax and feel comfortable in her surroundings. Once she feels safe, she is a great snuggler and loves to sit on your lap and give kisses.\n\nIf you would like to meet and adopt Dot, please go to our website and submit our adoption application www.malteserescuecalifornia.org. Remember, it\u2019s all about second chances.",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n**Gomie is initially fearful of new people, so a confident leader is a must. He will sometimes bark, which can make people nervous. He is good with dogs, but needs slow introductions.**\n\nHi I'm Gomie. I am a sweet boy with a heart of gold, but I am lacking in confidence. I need an experienced owner that will take the lead, so I don't think I have to. Please read the rest of my bio to understand more about me!\n\nI was found in a wooded ditch and I was in bad shape. I heard a nice lady talking to her other doggy. She sounded nice so I stuck my little nose out from under the bushes I was hiding under and scared her half to death! After lots of coaxing with treats, I let her and her husband scoop me up and take me home.\n\nNow I am safe with rescue and I'm looking for my forever home, could it be you? I'm just looking for someone to let me jump on the sofa and get lots of snuggles. I especially love to snuggle at night when it gets chilly. I am a shadow dog and I love to follow my foster mom as much as possible. If she's working at her desk I like to sit by her feet. \n\nI love going on walks. I get to meet so many dogs and people. I will accept pets from anyone that wants to give them to me. I love to chase dogs around the park. I haven't been able to do that lately since I had my FHO surgery (to fix my dislocated hip). I'm slowly getting used to using my leg again, but my adoptive family will need to continue to do my stretches with me. Right now I have a foster brother and I would love a home with another dog. I do okay amusing myself when needed as long as I have lots of toys to play with.\n\nI love to chew on anything I can find. I especially love to pull out tissues I find on the ground and shred them, so foster mom hides all the trash cans.\n\nI'm mostly potty trained. I've got a time limit. When that time limit expires I go, whether I'm inside or outside. So best to walk me every 8 hours or less.\n\nI would love a home where I don't have to be crated all the time. I love being free. But if I have to go in there I guess I can, but I will give you puppy dog eyes to try to persuade you otherwise. You've been warned.\n\nI'm good on walks, though I do pull sometimes when I'm excited. What do you expect? I'm new to the world and I just want to see, smell and explore it all. I would love an active person that likes to take me on walks since I love to be outside. Anytime I see another dog outside I wish I could go meet them and play. \n\nI am neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, and current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an app on our website: www.secondchancenc.org.",

She already knows how to use the doggie door and is learning to go outside to potty!\n\nJubilee loves playing with kids, toys, other dogs and even cats! Her favorite thing to do, however, is snuggle with her foster family. She's smart and lovable and will soon be able to learn lots of tricks and how to walk on a leash. \n\nJubilee will be available LOCALLY ONLY as foster to adopt February 10th. Later, when she has been spayed, the adoption can be finalized and she will be yours forever and ever!\n\nHowever, we're already accepting applications. If you are interested in checking out this adorable little girl to see if she could be your new best friend, call or text Julie at 435-773-5209 Tuesday through Saturday between 9:00 and 5:00 to arrange a meeting.",

She still gets nervous when dogs, people, and cars pass by on the walks. She typically likes to stop and stare.\n\n\n\nShe is crate trained and is doing great with housetraining - no accidents in a few days now - Wahoo. \n\n\n\nShe loves playing and chasing her 5-yr old foster hooman around the yard and she is gentle enough for him to even walk her. She is very playful and loves playing with her puppy toys. She may stay active all day long, but that just leads to cuddles and snuggles in the evening. \n\n\n\nShe has a very calm demeanor and bonus, very rarely barks. She would love to have a family with a large fenced yard and maybe even another dog, if you do not have children, to play with. \n\n \n\nInterested in meeting Tina?

            "description": "Ollie is a 2 year old, sweet, ADORABLE Basset Hound. \n\nOllie was surrendered to the shelter when he was a young pup because he jumped out the car window and broke his back leg, his family didn't want to pay for it or take care of it, so instead they dumped him at the shelter. The shelter did fix his leg and got him completely vetted. He was so lucky the shelter has those resources becuase most overcrowded shelters don't. He was then adopted to what he thought was his forever family. Due to no fault of his own he was recently dumped back at the shelter. The shelter knew he would be able to find a better home here in CO so they asked us to take him. \n\nOllie has been in Colorado for a little while now and is ready to find his forever home. His foster said he is a happy, super playful, energetic pup. They have a small senior little dog, and they say he cannot figure out why she won't play with him. His foster said he also loves to spoon and snuggle lol. He does great with her grandkids and is honestly just an awesome, loving, goofy dog who deserves the best home possible. He would love a home with another dog to play with but it's not mandatory as he is pretty happy no matter what.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ollie, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com\n\nOllie's adoption fee is $495.00",

Hes from a really rural area where unfortunately a lot of dogs dont make it out of the shelter. He is a lucky boy that we saved him though and we are so glad we did. He is a total goofy, sweetheart. He wants nothing more than to get love and attention and give it right back to his humans. He is wonderful with other dogs too - he LOVES to play. He does not bother cats. He isn't overly hyper or lazy. He's a great mix of playful and \"lets nap on the couch.\" He loves to play with toys and run around the yard. We think a home with a yard would be great for him. He is doing great in foster care with his house training. He has been through a lot the last few weeks and needs a place to just relax. He does play rough. No one ever taught him to stop puppy biting and now he is a big dog. He needs someone who will make sure he gets out of this habit. His foster is working with him and he is learning, but he will need someone who can tell him \"no\". Due to this, we want him to go to a home with kids over 12. He would never purposely hurt anyone, but he needs time to grow out of the habit. If you would like to meet him, fill out an application at bcaaofnj.org",

He is a sweet boy and has a special talent...he is bilingual and knows Spanish and English commands. He adores kids but could be too much for small children due to his size. He loved to escape and go to the nearby school where the children were and he lived with children in his old home. He can be very protective of his owners when people or other dogs come around but seems to be good with other dogs. The best thing to do is to bring your dog up to the shelter and do a meet and greet to make sure. If you would like to meet Apache, please call our shelter to make an appointment 972-377-1898.The adoption fee for this pet is $75. This cost includes spay/neuter, microchip, and all vaccines.",

Their adoption fee is $500 and includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, a nose to tail vet check, microchip and transport costs. Second Chances lists dogs as being available in White River Junction, VT because we transport our dogs to the area every 3rd week after they have been adopted. All of our local shelters have a high euthanasia rate due to overpopulation so we created our rescue group to primarily adopt to the northern states to help keep as many dogs as we can from entering our kill shelters.",

            "description": "This sweet, little dotted girl is looking for her forever home. Dottie has tons of puppy energy, but loves to snuggle up in your lap. Some of her favorite things include making 2 year olds squeal and giggle with her kisses, running after a toy, and being your work-from-home coworker/lap warmer. So far, Dottie's only dislike is the cold weather. She hustles back inside as quick as she can after a potty break. Her leash skills are outstanding for her age (though it sometimes takes a few steps to convince her the cold air is worth it!)\n\nDottie is still very much a puppy, but she has made great progress with her potty training. She has very few accidents when she is taken out consistently and often. She hasn't fallen in love with the crate yet, but her foster family continues to work on it. \n\nShe enjoys the company of her foster siblings, both furry and human. She is respectful of senior dogs and their space, but would definitely enjoy a companion to play with. She has shown some interest in the cats in her foster home, but no aggression.\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

She loves to chew on toys (she is definitely teething hard!) and run around the house exploring. She is spunky and hilarious. She hates the cold weather and will sit right by your feet and wait patiently for you to bring her back inside. She has been friendly but submissive/a little nervous when meeting new dogs. She warms up quickly though. Just teething like crazy (biting nonstop) so no small kids\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",
