Unfortunately this pretty little girl is only around 3 years old, and tested positive for Heartworm. She\u2019s cute as can be, and a little sweetheart. Our hearts dropped the second the heartworm test read positive. She has started her heartworm treatment and would need a home committed to bringing her back to our clinic over the next several months to continue her treatments. Cher is a little shy at first, but after a minute or so, she is nothing but smiles, play bows, and tail wags. She has SUCH an adorable little personality on her, and she makes the funniest little noises too! She always has us cracking up! She did well when tested with other dogs, but she prefers no cat friends. Cher is the perfect size, and has the cutest little face! Based on her cute little snout, we believe her to be some kind of Boxer mix. PLEASE SHARE OUR SWEET GIRL! \nCounty Line Pet Hospital \n3312 Chicago Road \nSteger, IL 60475\n(708)754-2351 \ncountylinepet@gmail.com",

He enjoys cuddling with women but DOES NOT LIKE MEN.  He should be in an adult home as his reaction to children is unknown and he is the size of an average cat.  He is dog selective - he likes calm, easygoing dogs but barks aggressively at excitable dogs.  His reaction to cats and other pets is also unknown.  He was neutered and had a dentistry at York SPCA.  Although he doesn't bark a lot, he can be loud when he sees someone he is trying to scare off or alert his friends.  If you would like to meet Romeo, please leave a voicemail at (717) 697-3377 to make an appointment with one of our dog adoption team members.",

His approximate DOB is 2/12/20. Zach is high energy and would really benefit from having a family that can keep up with his active lifestyle. He loves going on walks and hikes, and during the summer loves the water! He is working on his manors and socialization, he goes to work with his foster mom sometimes to get him socialized. As you can imagine the past 9 months of his life socializing him has been difficult because of the pandemic. But he is doing really well with it. He prefers to be the only pet in the home, but he doesn\u2019t mind large submissive female dogs, but no cats. He\u2019s good with kids but due to his high energy level and his tendencies to play rough and jump we recommend older children. He is very smart and very loyal to his people, he will make someone a great companion! If you feel like he would make a great addition to your home please fill out an application.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please complete an application from our website at www.josephslegacyrescue.org\u00a0\n\nSomeone will contact you to discuss the adoption process and set up a meet and greet with the animal you are interested in. \u00a0All potential adopters will be subject to a home visit.\n\nPuppies (under 12 months) - \u00a0$300*\nDog (12 months and older) \u00a0- $200*\nSenior Dogs - $100*\n\nAll Canines are HW tested (if over 6 months old), vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, spayed/neutered, rabies vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, are on monthly flea and heartworm prevention, and also have a current Butler County dog license.\n\n*Joseph's Legacy reserves the right to raise or lower adoption fees on certain animals. These adjusted fees will normally be added to the individual animal's profile. If there are any concerns about the adoption fee please verify with the adoption coordinator that has contacted you.",

            "description": "Josephine is a 2 year old pit bull who is the absolute sweetest girl. She is a former mama dog who was left behind when her babies went to a different rescue. She was such a good mama she nursed a few orphan puppies while at the shelter. Joey is known to be toy possessive so she is not allowed having those items outside of her crate. She is crate trained and housebroken. She has poor leash manners, meaning she pulls and is very strong. However she is very smart and could easily learn with consistency. Joey is the kind of dog that could go running with you during the day and cuddle up with you and be a couch potato at night.All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

I am housebroken, crate trained, walk well on a leash and get along with my furry siblings! \n\nMy ideal home would be with a family that has another pup for me to play with and of course a yard to run around.

After 6 months of living together without issue, a fight broke out and Shea was blamed.\n\nWe decided to give Shea a chance and he seems like a very sweet boy who wants to play with the other dogs in the home.\n\nShea is 55 pounds of muscle and does need some basic obedience.\n\nShea has not been kid or cat tested yet.\n\nUpdates on Shea will be posted as we learn more about him",

            "description": "This sweet and handsome boy is Camo. We\u2019re not sure what Camo\u2019s first two years were like, but his family left him tied up outside of the animal shelter at the beginning of COVID. Camo is looking for a special owner and home - he is nervous when it comes to meeting new people, and may take some time to warm up, but is so worth it when he does. He loves snuggles, a big fluffy round bed, practicing his tricks, and watching the world from his window seat. Camo is house trained, crate trained, muzzle trained, and walks great on a leash. If you\u2019re looking for an easy and social dog you can take anywhere, Camo is not a good fit for you. Because of Camo\u2019s past interactions with strangers, we\u2019re looking for an experienced owner who is willing to put in the time and work to help him be his very best. We don\u2019t know who he is with other dogs, but Camo will need to be in a home with no children. At home, he is a relaxed, loving, and fiercely loyal boy. His new owner will be provided with his supplies and a training course with a behaviorist, to best be introduced into his new environment.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/camossmiles/",

I am a pro snuggler and working on learning to be independent and enjoy time in my crate. I like other dogs and am fine to have a doggie sibling in my forever home. Talk to the humans about how to meet me and make my dreams come true!\nAbout my Perfect home:\nI would love to have forever humans who are home often, but I will adjust fine if you are not. Other than that, I just want someone to love and play with!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccines, heartworm tested, microchipped and spayed/neutered prior to adoption.

            "description": "Chispa T. is a beautiful and loving 13-year-old female German Shepherd Dog (GSD) who was taken to a shelter in southern California because her owners work took him out of town often. Her previous owner described her as being very friendly to dogs, people and cats. She is also leash trained and housebroken. Sadly when she arrived at the shelter she was infested with fleas and so underweight that her hip bones showed. At the shelter, Chispa was fed and quickly re-gained weight. Her medical check showed signs of her age, including hip dysplasia and spondylosis, and her skin and hair required treatment. Chispa remained at the shelter for an extended period of time, but overall she remained eager to explore her surroundings and very happy to see new people.\n\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue has taken over care for Chispa. She is a beautiful girl who will now receive the medical care she needs. Although she has a stiff gait, she is quite mobile and very much loves human interaction. TSGSR will look for a new family with time to love to this wonderful dog. \n\nChispa T. Summary:\n- Chispa is a Female, 13 yrs old, weighs 62 lbs, current on shots\n- Good with Adults, dogs, and travel in the car\n- Good with children\n- Good with cats (per prior owner)\n \n\nChispa passed a set of evaluation tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. Chispa remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. As a result, she was accepted into the TSGSR program. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Chispa to TSGSR! Check back often. We will be updating her bio as we learn more about her!\n\nWhat's Next for ChispaT.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Chispa is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for her well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for her for the rest of her life. Chispa will come to her new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nChispas medical expenses will be covered for the rest of her life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Chispa, or are interested in possibly providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about her on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/rswhDNZMcGU\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application.

            "description": "Colt was surrendered to rescue to save his life. He lives in a rural area and was very much loved.  Unfortunately, he was squirted in the face by a bicyclist when he was running after them, and now he sees them as predators.  Recently someone was riding by and he opened the front door to the house and ran after them and nipped them. The person he nipped, wants him euthanized.  The front yard of his house is not fenced.  Colt is housebroken, knows basic commands, and is good with goats, but lived in the house and is a house pet.  He is housebroken, and does not need to be crated.  He was born the end of October 2016.  Colt would do best in a home in a quiet area without lots of bicyclists.  He is unproven with cats, good with most other dogs, and can be selective with people  - typical with this breed. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 5 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nColt will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

He is very \"laid back\", gentle and easy going. When it's time to cuddle up on the sofa to watch TV, Snickers is right there making himself quite comfortable. Usually laying on one of the pillows! He becomes very attached to his humans. Smart, lovable and ready to be spoiled more than he already is. Very bonded with his brother, Peanut, and they must be adopted together. Playful, sweet and fun. He is very sweet and loving. He has an \"old soul\" and will always be quietly by your side, ready to give and receive love. He could easily become your soulmate.\n\nSnickers has intermittent seizures which 3 vets have determined are ideopathic. He is on meds to help with that. Environmental allergies, mostly to grass, are also something this sweetheart deals with causing skin issues.\n\nSnickers was born at his foster mom's and was adopted out with his brother, Peanut. They have been together since birth. Unfortunately, a divorce tore their family of over a year apart. They are back with their original foster mom, loving it, being spoiled! Snickers and his brother Peanut must be adopted together so these sweet boys don't have to deal with being torn apart from each other. They are each other's best friend and comfort. You won't be disappointed with these 2 wonderful loving boys! Give them time to adjust, and you'll have the most loving and loyal dogs you could ask for! For 5 1/2 years they have been each other's strength, comfort and best friend.\n\nTheir perfect forever home waits for them, we just know it! Could it be yours?\n\nPlease contact\ninfo@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog or to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs.

Bingo can sit, shake and play tug of war for hours. After he has gotten all his energy out he loves to cuddle and relax right next to his pack. He truly is a gentle giant. Has: harness, rabies tags, play toys, acerbic wit. Bingo is a joyful young dog who is eager to share his love with you. He is fully house trained but on the early end of being properly leash trained. Bingo needs a strong attentive owner to be on the other end of his lead in case a squirrel or a cat comes into view. I weigh approximately 88 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.

When he was no longer able to care for her, he took her to a high kill shelter where she was quickly put on the euthanization list.  The man contacted us and begged us to get Lucy out of the shelter.  That same day, we freed her from the shelter.  She is now in a loving foster home, but she needs to find a family to call her own. Lucy likes some dogs, but others no. \n\n Lucy is absolutely crazy about babies and children!  She gets so excited when she sees children.  Lucy has been up for adoption for an entire year, with not one person interested in her.  She is a great, loving girl who deserves much love and attention.  \n\nLucy is in Splendora (10 minutes north of Kingwood) if you would like to come meet her.  I promise, you won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you are interested in Lucy, please text 713-562-6059 and we will answer any questions you may have.",

He is a little shy sometimes but warms up after he spends a little time with you. Todd was very neglected in the past so he has a few scars on the inside and outside. He was found tied to a tree without food or water. He was tied with two other dogs, both of which have found forever homes! He would love to lay in your lap on the couch and binge watch your favorite shows all day. Todd is so deserving of a loving home and would be the most loyal companion ever. Todd would be best in a calm home with no small children as he is frightened by loud noises and sudden movements. Be the one to give him a second chance, every dog deserves one!",

She\u2019s a 3 year old professional tennis ball catcher. She\u2019s half English springer/blue lacy- AKA hard working girl!\n\nHer parents passed away recently. She\u2019s been crashing with a foster family, but she\u2019s just not thriving there! Sometimes we have to do what\u2019s best for the pup. \nWhat we love about her is her goofy, silly but loving personality and how she is happiest snuggled up next to us on the couch.  Quite the sweetheart!  She loves fetch and chew toys, has great energy, but can handle being an inside dog as well.  She loves to play in water: drinking from a hose, running through the sprinklers or even fetching a ball from the first step of the pool.  You can see her personality at these times.  She knows all her basic commands plus shake and roll over for a belly rub.  Leash training and walks will need a refresher course.  Snoopy is on a prescription allergy medication for itchy skin from food sensitivities and is doing really well on it.  Socially, she is great with kids over 5 years, younger children get whapped in the face with her enthusiastic tail, not because she doesn't get along with them.  She has done well with two smaller male dogs, but is used to being Queen of the house and could be anxious with another alpha female.\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s looking for a new place to sort of start over and chase some tennis balls. Please share & contact shell01515@gmail.com with any questions!",

Emma is an absolute joy and a wonderful companion. She is a very sweet, very special girl with a lot of love to give.\nAt 7 years old, Emma is a perfect mix of playful and cuddly. She loves squeaky toys, but she is happy to share them with you, especially if that means a short game of fetch or low-speed chase (she rarely gets above a \"trot\" inside the house). More often than not, Emma can be found cuddled up in her bed with her current favorite toy. She is a very mellow girl--a true \"velcro\" Dane--and she loves to give and receive affection. Emma is completely house and crate trained, and she is really good at avoiding potential household trouble. No counter-surfing or trash-can diving for this girl, even when there are temptations. She responds well to basic commands and is even learning some new ones!\nEmma loves going for walks and she's great on leash. Emma is a great hiking partner and loves the beach too!\n\nEmma's original home was full of stress, so she will need a relatively calm and stable forever home, with an adult family (no kids) who has large-breed experience. Although she is generally good at meeting new people, she can be a bit unsure of them, especially when there is a lot going on around her and she starts feeling overwhelmed. She is fine with other dogs while on walks or at the dog park, but Emma will do best as an \"only child\" and she is all the dog any family could need.\n(Emma asked me to add that she would like a forever family who will give her chest rubs. And new squeaky toys.)\n\nhttps://greatdanefriends.com/emma\n\nPlease contact Great Dane Friends (info@greatdanefriends.com) for more information about this pet. *****Great Dane Friends of Ruff Love covers NC and surrounding states for adoptions. We require a fenced yard (exceptions made on a case by case basis - NO exceptions for puppies or deaf/vision impaired dogs - no invisible fencing), that stairs in the home be covered with some sort of slip resistant material to prevent injury, that all other animals in the home be up to date on vaccinations as well as spayed/neutered and that all dogs live inside as a part of the family. Our approval process consists of an application, vet and reference checks, phone interview and house check. Please email us for an application or if you have any questions.*****\n\n1/26/21 2:45 PM",

            "description": "Cocoa has mastered obedience class where she was a star student and is a professional at playing fetch! She is a bundle of energy who will play as long as she can and is looking for an active home with lots of toys! She loves going to daily playgroup, but since her play style is rough, she tends to play with other dogs who are as rambunctious as her, and has done a good job of knowing when to \"tone it down\". She gets super excited when she realizes it's her turn to come out for a walk, so she sometimes needs to be reminded of her manners in her kennel and can pull on the leash a bit - we think that is why she is waiting for a home. Give her some time and she settles down, though she still prefers to walk at a quick pace, and is a great walking partner. She has been crated on some of her outings and jumped right in - so we are pretty sure she is crate trained. Cocoa loves toys more than anything! Balls, squeakers, ropes-you name it, she'll play with it! She is really cuddly and affectionate and combines her love of people and toys by snuggling on her person's lap while chewing her toy. Although she has rambunctious play-friends here who can handle her particularly rambunctious play style, Cocoa is a little too intense for many dogs and would probably do best as the only dog in her new home. If you're looking for an active, playful dog who will also snuggle with you at the end of the day, be sure to say hello to Cocoa!",

Then as I was just wondering around trying to survive, some cruel man shot me in the hip.  His neighbor saw him aiming at me to shoot me again.  She pleaded with the big, fat meanie head to stop and she scooped me up and took me away.  My savior!  She was so very nice.  The thing is, she had already had 7 dogs dumped on her that she took in, so her home was full.  She had agreed with her husband that there would be no more dogs taken in.  \n\nJust keep peace in her home, she hid me in the barn for a little while and snuck me off to the vet. ;)\nAs soon as I was fixed up, she brought me to Lucies where I could be cared for and loved.  I'll never forget her, for she was my guardian angel. :)\n\nI have a moderate energy level, but more than anything I would REALLY love to be a lap dog.  I never ever meet a stranger.  After a hike or a jog, I would just love to settle in and snuggle on the couch with you just gazing into your loving eyes.  I make great eye contact when there are no distractions around.  \n\nOh and an important thing; I do NOT like dogs that are bigger than me.  I don't really remember why, perhaps I used to have to fight for food or worse :(\n\nI am highly trainable and am already leash and crate trained.  And, I just love squeaky toys!! I MUST have them, they are my absolute favorite!!  squeak squeak squeak  hehehe\n\nSo now that you know my story, aren't you ready to come meet me and take me and love me forever?  Pretty please?  I thought so, see ya soon!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

Heni has diabetes insipidous and takes an injection of a hormone twice a day that helps concentrate her urine. The medication is approx $150 for 6 months supply. Since receiving her medicine, she has mastered house breaking and is working on crate training. She does prefer the large plastic taxi rather than a wire crate. Heni is great with kids and dogs but would not do well with cats. Heni would love an active family and fenced in yard, as she loves to play! We guess Heni to be approx 1 year old.

            "description": "Luna is a very sweet and sassy mixed breed girl that's around 5-6 years old. She was adopted and returned a year later for not getting along with the other resident dog. However, she learned how to be a very good girl in a home environment as she is potty trained, crate trained, knows some basic commands, and so far has shown that she doesn't have any naughty habits like counter surfing or getting into trash cans. Luna loves playing with her much larger and very patient foster brother, but with her history, she may be best as the only pet. A male, large breed dog would be the best fit if she did go to home that already has another dog. Luna does get over stimulated when playing with her foster brother but is easily corrected by both foster brother and foster mom and will go lay down on the doggie bed for a good nap. She is not recommended for small dogs or cats. Her previous owners also stated that she is good with kids. They also stated she is nervous with new people but warms up quickly.",

We love her!\"    Meet Penny (nee Cristal - from our Champagne litter). Her litter came to us on New Years Eve 2016, ergo the name. Just a few weeks old - a group of 6 yummy babies. She was one of the two girls. This was a BIG chunky monkey group at 6 weeks they were weighing in at 15 pounds. :)  \n4 years later Penny is back with us. Penny bit their 3 year old and unfortunately they lost all trust in her. We are hoping to find a family for Penny that has older children that are more predictable, or no children. From the family that had her for 4 years. \"Penny is a sweet 4 year old Great Dane/Lab mix (80+ pounds). She has been the greatest dog. And we truly love her. She is house trained, but not crate trained. We have had her since she was 8 weeks old. Penny loves a good car ride, especially if it ends with ice cream or pupachino. She can find any spot comfortable for a good nap after a nice walk (which she enjoys). She also likes to dress up for holidays, Christmas pajamas or Halloween costume, she's a great sport.\" Penny lives with a foster family with a dog and has done beautifully. We have had Penny evaluated by Tenasity from the post evaluation notes  \"All in all I believe Penny is no more of a threat to people or other dogs then most dogs. Based on what I know of the situation and how Penny interacted on the day of this evaluation I do not think she is a threat to society. I do not think Penny is sincerely dog aggressive. Could she get into a fight? Absolutely. But she is no more likely to do so then any other well socialized dog. However I believe she would do well in a home with another dog if the owners are dog savvy owners.\" We will not place with a family with young children. Penny could use some training with 'leave it' and not pulling on her lead.",

His favorite inside activity is cuddling, he sleeps on his back and absolutely loves to lay his head on your lap or arm. Bully also enjoys going for walks & jogs around the neighbourhood. He is a quick learner with a strong drive to please. He can be shy with some humans at first, but just let him get comfortable for a few minutes and he'll be your new best friend. All he wants is love and to make his forever humans happy!\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so don't let location hold you back)!\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

She gets along with other dogs but isn't playful with them. For her, it is all about people!\n\n**Ellie does have some medical issues but has been cleared by the vet to be adopted. So please be aware she will need regular check-ups to keep her healthy. She has heart disease, but its managed with meds and has elevated kidney values which don't seem to cause her any noticeable issues but need to be monitored to keep her safe. And due to the medical issues, she is unable to be spayed.\n\n**Note from foster: She is 80% deaf. She needs to be able to SEE you. If you come up behind her, it startles her & shell growl & nip. \n\nInterested, apply at www.aychihuahuarescue.org/adopt",

She's had a special job here in foster care - she has been the \"ears\" for a young deaf dog :-) Folie gets daily playdates with other dogs of various sizes and ages and she's good with cats too. She has longer/fur around the neck area which makes her extra huggable :-) Sweet girl !\n\nImportant:\nDo you live in our adopting area? Do you have another young playful friendly male dog? If yes to both questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nHer adoption fee includes spaying, vaccine series, deworming, rabies, and microchip. Folie was born April 20, 2020.\n\nPlease read all info below. We're sorry to have to state this, but we've been bombarded with people asking us the very things we already state and just don't have the manpower to answer everyone. -- if you email us or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures listed below we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below!\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. First, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application. (Please do not call or text). We are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal(s). If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. If your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. Since we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you to send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. We will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we) and have hand sanitizer.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Our animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime - we appreciate staying in touch periodically through the years (a holiday card, social media, pics, videos, whatever works for you :-)\n\nHappy Tails! \nThanks very much!\n\n",

I'm about 70 pounds, neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and potty trained. Woohoo!\n\nI know I'm technically a senior but I don't feel a day over middle-aged. I still like to play with toys, lope around the yard and go for walks. I'm learning to walk nicely on a leash. \n\nI am generally good with other dogs. I haven't met any cats but I\u2019m a little too interested in them on walks. I have had very little interaction with children. I'm pretty sure I'd like anyone that scratched my ears or gave me treats.\n\nI'm a little hard of hearing and sleep hard. I am a super sniffer and if you are cooking, I'll be there to provide moral support and supervise. I have mild arthritis and take medicine for that. I'm pretty healthy otherwise, especially for such an established gentleman.\n\nI'd love to find a home of my own. If you think it's with you, please apply to adopt me here: https://www.dogsdeservebetterblueridge.org/adopt",

CANCELED\nFor an application, please email info@tailsfromtheheart.org\n\nWith everything going on currently with COVID-19, we have canceled our public meet and greets until further notice. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please email us or fill out our online application. We can then review and send to the foster family. We may cancel our home visits as well but if you could attach photos of your yard and one or two of your home that would be great. In lieu of the visit this would allow us to meet you and allow you to meet the pet and conduct a possible adoption either outside your home or at a public place where safe distancing can occur.\n",

            "description": "**Update**  (10/4/2020)  Since Bert is around 14 years old, he will be staying with our rescue for the rest of his life.  Bert is a sweet, gentle old man, and he just wants to be loved.   He gets along with all of his foster siblings, but we think that he would love a little more quiet environment.   Our rescue will provide everything that Bert needs.   INTERESTED IN BEING BERT'S PERMANENT FOSTER?  PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.   (9/12/2020)  Bert, and his good friend, Ernie, were found posted on craigslist, and a kind person picked them up immediately.   Bert was severely matted and is very thin.   He is thought to be 13-14 years old and needs lots of TLC and good food.  Bert loves to sleep and is settling in well with his foster family and other foster dogs.   He is so sweet, and just wants to be loved.   Bert had an exam, received his vax, and was shaved to remove all the matting.   Bert must feel soooo good now!  He has eye drops which he tolerates well.  Bert & Ernie do not really appear to be bonded, so they can be adopted together or separately.   Bert will need a very special adopter to give this gentle man all the love and good care that he deserves.  IF YOU LIVE IN THE LEB/LANC/HBG AREA AND WOULD LIKE TO FOSTER BERT AND/OR ERNIE, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

            "description": "This little 10 year old blind Boston is such a clown. Oreo loves to eat, loves to snuggle and seems to have developed a sixth sense when it comes to mobility. He made me laugh during his shoot-he kept looking up as if seeking the sun on his face. This is what rescue is about, being loved and cared for as long as it takes...until the perfect furever home is found.\n\nOreo, a little Boston, is a special needs senior looking for his fur-ever home. He is such a love bug and easy going fellow. He is a perfect little love, a senior with a handicap that doesn't slow him down. He loves to snuggle and wash your face....just shows senior lumpy, blind boys with HW and heart murmur are AMAZING...this boy has so much love to give he's so funny when he shakes stuffing out of toys, flings toys across room, screams at Scruffy who won't share food.\n\nOreo was found as a stray and in pretty rough shape. A senior Boston terrier mix in need of medical care for his eyes, skin and teeth. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. \n\nYou can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. For more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

It takes her time to warm up to strangers but once she knows you aren't a threat, she is your bestie ( like it or not ). In her previous home she was slapped around by adults and kids as young as 9 years so it WILL take her time to acclimate to a new home and positive training is the only type of training we will accept for Luna. If you are patient and kind then send us an app for our girl. Luna has since been spayed & microchipped & is ready for adoption",

Her DNA test says she's 78% Great Pyrenees, 19% Anatolian Shepherd Dog, 2% Maremma Sheepdog, 1% Saluki. \"Izzy\" is the dominant sister, but is a bit shy at first with new people and new experiences, she's a country girl at heart. A big girl at 126 lbs., this gentle soul needs an owner willing to continue her training and a male canine companion to play with and learn from.\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Handsome and sweet boy Chuck came to us in July from an overcrowded shelter in Texas. It was so sad for staff and volunteers there to see Chuck languishing in a kennel unable to move well, because he has dysplasia on both sides. When Chuck arrived, he dragged his back legs and feet. \nWe had Chuck x-rayed and seen by two vets and there is no surgery recommended, just pain meds and supplements, and building strength. Turns out, this did the trick! Chuck came to us so weak, and now it is barely noticeable! He looks amazing now! That is what good nutrition, vet care, regular walks and cuddle sessions, AND weekly underwater treadmill sessions at Splash Dog can do for a dog! And Chuck is worth it all. He is sooo so beloved, and it breaks our hearts that he is living at the shelter.\n\nChuck's adoption fee has been sponsored by the company Grounds N Hounds! Heartland would supply a year's worth of supplements and meds to Chuck's adopter! \n\nIn addition, he has a mild case of Heartworm which we are treating and which he is no worse for the wear for having! Heartworm is not contagious and it is curable, and we make sure we treat it until it has cleared. \n\nChuck melts and breaks our hearts. We just want Chuck to feel safe and loved. In the kennel he is pretty stressed out, but outside of it he is a normal energetic dog, and affectionate. Chuck loooves neck scratches, he bends so far to the side you are scratching he about falls over! Chuck is startled by motorcycles and bikes or trucks whizzing by him. He is a country boy from Texas, after all. \n\nChuck's favorite past time is going for long hikes! And car rides. \n\nOn top of all that, Chuck needs to be an only pet. He is not crazy about most dogs and does not like cats either. \n\nWe know this is a tough case. But Chuck is so worth it. He just wants to be near his person at all times, he wants to soak up the attention and affection before he has to go back to his kennel. \n\nWe would love to place Chuck in a home with a fenced yard, or in a quieter area where he could enjoy lots of walks. Please reach out to us if you can be Chuck's hero, he deserves better than a shelter, though we love him dearly here.",

            "description": "Luna is another victim of lack of fencing. Like her mate and daughters, she was surrendered by her owner after he found her at the wrong end of his neighbor's shotgun, because she was allowed to run loose on everyone's property in a rural area. Luna is Miss Bossy Pants, she's picky about her dog friends, even males, so would do best as an only dog with a Pyr-experienced owner. A beautiful girl who knows it, she's a bit of a diva who isn't all that interested in being with other dogs, but thrives on attention from people. Based on the DNA tests of one of her daughters and the father of her only litter, she is mostly Great Pyrenees with a touch of Maremma. She's learning to walk on leash and knows some commands, but still needs a knowledgeable owner to continue her training. This beautiful girl is looking for a quiet home with adults, no small children, where she can be the only dog, though a cat or two would be fine. \n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

She does well with other dogs that are laid back, but would prefer to be the only dog so she can be center of attention. She would be fine with older children, and has not been tested around cats. She is currently mastering her house training and crate training. Sadie will be ready to go to her forever home on October 3rd.

He is extremely smart, crate trained(however you do have to give him a little nudge to get him to go in), house trained, is learning how to sit, very gentle(he will gently take a treat from my mouth), loves to give kisses, does not bark at all, walks nicely on a leash without pulling and just wants to be in our presence. He has met my male and female dogs and did not react but I have not done formal introductions yet. He would make a great companion. \n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.",

Bowser will need to be adopted to  a home with no other animals, and no children.  \n\nBowser Was adopted and returned through no fault of him or the Kind family who adopted him.  \n\nWe did learn that Bowser will need some training to not jump and also training to be housebroke.  In addition, he does not seem to like other dogs or cats And would not be a good fit for a home with children.  With some training he will be an amazing dog and does love to be pet and has a beautiful face and eyes.  We are confident there will be a home that will meet Bower\u2019s specific needs.  He is a beauty And only about a year old !  He has been neutered, shots, and heart worm negative.  (Also he does not travel very well right now so it may be difficult (but not impossible) to get him to a home far away. \n\n\n Thanks.",

He found himself in need of a home and a new health journey recently and Adopt-A-Dog stepped in to help this XL guy get to where he needs to be which is now an L kinda guy! Walter is almost too much personality in one dog's body and would make an excellent addition to a home with another dog or kids to help him enjoy all the little things life has to offer. We cannot stop talking about how fantastic Walter is, so please help us continue by contacting our Adoptions team today!\n\nTo adopt Walter, please fill out our adoptions questionnaire here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7\n\nContact our Adoptions team at adoptions@adoptadog.org or (914) 273-1674 for more information!",

            "description": "From Marvel's current mom:\n\nMarvel is a 4 year old adventure lover who is happy when she gets to go with her human on a hike, run, car ride/road trip, etc. She traveled across the country with me for 5 months and was a wonderful companion and friend. She is a rescue pup and had some trauma early on in life but I loved on her and worked with her for over a year and she has come a long way in her trust of humans, obedience/listening, leash and trail training, and has overall calmed down quite a bit in the anxiety she showed early on.\n\nWith a trusted person who she can sense likes her, she loves to cuddle in any way you let her. For the first 6 months I had her, she slept right next to me every night (often inside my sleeping bag with me) but now sleeps on the floor inside. She is great in the car and in tents as well. She is adaptable and has lived in lots of different places with different roommates and many road trips/visits at other people\u2019s houses. She is house trained but not crate trained. She is generally content to stay in a house or yard during the day while I\u2019m at work but will scratch up doors and dig at times. She is not a chewer. She is a protector and will always let you know when someone is arriving at the house/property. She would be a great guard dog. I love this dog dearly and am so sad to see her go. I recently moved to a new city and cannot have her with me this time so she is being kept temporarily by some dear friends of mine until we find a new loving person for her.\n\nShe likes to play rough with other dogs and is always great in neutral places like dog parks and meeting another dog on a trail..but she has shown to be territorial in a home setting both towards other dogs and at times to new humans as well. She is consistently responding better and better to voice commands to stand down and trust that a new person is a friend. She would probably do best in a single dog home but has lived with other dogs with mixed results. She generally does better with male dogs but has been known to pick fights over sleeping space/food/toys. It is possible that she could adjust to living with other dogs if certain measures were taken like feeding them separately and patiently helping them work out their alpha order. She thinks she is an alpha but doesn\u2019t always give the appropriate signals and has made a few female dog enemies. Sometimes she chases cats for the fun of it but has lived with several cats at different times and has never hurt one in any way.\n\nMarvel would do well with an owner who has a lot of patience and is willing to put time into further training, rehabilitation, and daily exercise. So many people in our life have loved her and connected instantly with her. She would be a wonderful companion for someone with a lot of love to give and receive.",

River was found stuck in the mud on the Big River.  Luckily she was found by a couple who dug her out and took her to the local shelter.  We found River there. \n\nRiver has been painfully shy over the last year, but is improving every day.  For the first 8 months that she was with us, she never left the bed except to potty on a potty pad. In the last 4 months River has learned to go outside to potty, play with other dogs, and get excited when her human gets home.  She loves meal times and takes treats so gently.  River is still painfully shy with strangers, but she\u2019s much better than she used to be.  The one thing River has not mastered yet is how to walk on a leash. She is just completely afraid, even with a harness on. She will just lay down and not move so she has to be carried.  We believe if she can find a family of her own with at least one other dog that likes to play, she would continue to come out of her shell and eventually even learn to walk on a leash.  River is good with other dogs, and cats.",

He was adopted from Dog Gone Seattle as a puppy (DOB 1/7/2018) but his family had a baby and Rhone did not adjust well to sharing his home with an infant. Rhone did live with another dog and has dog friends, but will need to be well matched with a resident dog and does need slow introductions to other dogs. He also requires strong leadership to manage behavior tendencies such as leash reactivity or territorial behavior toward strangers. He is well trained, having been through full obedience training, and knows many commands including sit, down, place, come, and kennel up. However he will require ongoing structure and management otherwise he is inclined to unwanted behaviors. He is house trained and crate trained. His ideal home will be with an adult or couple that has dog experience, is willing to continue with balanced training that has been effective for him, and willing to use a crate. No children, no cats, and no apartments.\n\nAdoption Info: Rhone's adoption fee is $350 which includes his vetting and an in-home training session at the time of adoption. He is neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations. Adoption fees may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online: www.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application 2/2/21 5:36 PM",

The odds were not in his favor but he's done it! We go back this week for his bloodwork to make sure he is clear on everything he had. The list is long but I am super hopeful he is fully recovered. He will stay on all his medication through January when he has his follow up appointment but for me the goal was to get him through the 2 month mark, which they said he most likely wouldn't survive but he did!!! So fingers crossed for a very great results of blood work!\n\nMax was found wandering the streets in Texas. He kept showing up at a house, where the home owners reached out for help from SSR. He had both mange and is neurological from distemper. It is unknown at this time if he will completely recover or not, however he has been released from the hospital and is now in foster care. Hopefully he'll make a full recovery and will make his way to the Virginia area in the future.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

            "description": "Nugget is a rock of gold.  He came from a rescue in Tennessee with his half-brothers - Atlas, Leonhard, and Sabian.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in March 2020, Nugget isn't quite as big as his brothers (50 - 55 lb), but he hasn't reached adult size yet.\n\nNugget is being fostered with a trainer, so is learning many things in addition to house-training.  He is comfy in a 42\" crate (although when left alone he salivates excessively) and is leash-savvy.  He rides well when he has a confident doggy friend, but with encouragement is fine even when alone.  He likes people and is good with polite dogs.  \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

Phoebe is a 13 year old senior chihuahua that is ready to find her new parents. As you can see by her photos, she loves her food and is looking for a family to continue to spoil her rotten. She may be a tad overweight and could use someone to help her get back to her bikini bod weight. Phoebe is a little needy and prefers to have all of your attention, so needs to be a solo pet in the home. Phoebe would like to have a calm, quiet home to lounge around in, so we think she'd do best in a home without children. She does has a collapsed larynx and requires a daily medication as well. Get your application in quickly for this senior sweetie today!\n\nPhoebe is a member of our FIDO prison program. FIDO dogs are obedience trained and socialized by the prison inmates. The $150 adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, de-worming, microchip, and heart worm test (and current with monthly preventative). They are house trained, crate trained, and know their 5 basic commands. If interested in meeting a FIDO dog, please fill out an application online at: inapl.org/adoption-application.

            "description": "Leonhard is a handsome and sweet boy.  His coat is such a dark chocolate color as to appear black.  He was left outside and abandoned with his 2 brothers and another pup from his mom's most recent litter.  It was his lucky day when his owner left him to fend for himself as he's now living in a warm, safe home with plenty to eat.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Sept. 2019, Leonhard is a young man with tons of affection.  It takes him a little patience to warm up to new dogs, but enjoys playing with polite ones.\n\nLeonhard has been kept outside since a puppy, but he caught on quickly and is now leash-savvy and comfy in a 42\" crate so he has room to sprawl.  He's house-trained when kept on a regular schedule.  We recommend once an hour during the first 2 days in a new situation, then every 2 hours for several days, then a more regular schedule once he's learned that he only needs to wait and his family will take him for a potty break.\n\nLeonhard loves adventures, although he's nervous in the car, and is timid in new environments.  He enjoys sniffing new things and with reinforcement, should shortly gain confidence in his handler.  \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

I guarantee you there will be no lucky leprechauns visiting their home!  Anyway, a very kind family took me in, as I was dumped near them. This is the 2nd time this family has taken in a dumped dog.  They really are guardian angels and I am so happy for the time I got to spend with them until Lucies had an opening for me.  They treated me well and let me play with their 2 dogs.  The best fun was when their grandkids came over to visit!  Ah...great times.\n\nI ride pretty good in a car, once you get me in that is.  Memories of being dumped sometimes still run through my mind, but once I'm in, I'm good.\n\nI'm leash and crate trained.  My only intolerance is cats. For some reason, we do NOT get along.  But that's ok.  Felines are not for everyone!\n\nSo know that you know my story, dontcha wanna come visit me and see how much you will adore me??  I'd love to have you as my loving family.  What do you say?\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "BRUNO NEEDS A LOVING FOREVER HOME!!! This is a courtesy post. Bruno is not available through Dogs XL. Please contact Tru Rescue for more information.\n \n\nName: Bruno\n\nBreed: Mastiff mix (likely Mastiff/Rottweiler mix)\n\nApproximate Age: 2 years\n\nApproximate Weight: 100 lbs\n\nCurrent Location: Local foster home\n\nMeet Bruno! This handsome hunk has come a long way from his early rescue days, when he was emaciated, alone at a high kill shelter in Texas. He was mere hours away from being euthanized when Tru Rescue stepped in to rescue this big ol' lug and find him a forever family to love!\n\nBruno is 2 years old and about 100 lbs. He has great house manners and knows a whole host of commands, including \"sit,\" \"stay,\" \"leave it,\" \"heel,\" and even \"shake,\" among others. Bruno walks nicely on a leash with a prong collar most of the time, but would do best with a family who will continue his obedience training and help him polish up his leash manners. Bruno is house broken and crate trained, but is not destructive around the house and is trusted to free roam for most of the day, though he sleeps in his crate at night and hangs out in there while his foster humans are out of the house. Bruno is a power chewer and loves to chomp down on sturdy chews and so-called indestructible toys... his dream job is tough toy tester! \n\nBruno is true to his breed(s), and is the loyal, loving family member you could ever hope for! However, Bruno also feels that his #1 duty is to protect his people. He is not a fan of strangers visiting his house or invading his yard, and he's especially not a fan of unknown men. Bruno has a bite history because he lunged at an unfamiliar man wearing a hat and sunglasses. While the bite was not severe and did not require significant medical attention, Bruno is a big, powerful dog, so he is looking for a strong, guardian breed-experienced leader to provide structure, boundaries and positive reinforcement training and who will responsibly manage his guarding behaviors. Bruno's ideal family would have a fenced-in yard. Despite his young age, Bruno is low energy and mostly prefers to hang out on the couch or stand guard, and only needs one or two short walks a day (plus potty breaks in the yard).   \n\nBruno is good with other dogs, but needs a home without cats or kids. \n\nTo ensure Bruno's new family is set up for success, Tru Rescue is requiring that his adopters complete a training course with Stateline Canine and Bruno's current foster to learn his commands and understand how best to manage his personality and character traits and how to continue his training to ensure he's the best buddy he can be!\n\nBruno is up to date on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped. His  adoption fee is $350. To learn more about Bruno or apply to adopt him, please visit Tru Rescue's website: https://trurescue.org/\n\nBruno needs a loving forever home to lavish attention (and treats) on him. Please open your heart and home to Bruno!\n",

            "description": "Meet Beau!\nWe rescued Beau after he was shot in the face!! Our vet patched him up with reconstructive surgery to his tongue and lower jaw. He\u2019s healed up perfectly and is ready to find his furever home! \n\nBeauregard is a 2yr old pibble hunk of love. He is very, very gentle and docile.  His personality is wonderfully happy with a smile that will make you light up.  You can see the happiness in his sweet face once he was out of the scary shelter where he\u2019s been for months recovering from being shot in the face.\n\nBeauregard is a regal gentleman.  He is easy....a truly delightful dog.  Given his horrific abuse, we are always so amazed at their resilience, trust and love they show humans unconditionally.\n\nHe is good with other dogs with slow introductions and we are preferring kids over 10 years old to adopt Beau!\n\n*We are requiring a fence to adopt! No condos or apartments please!\n \nApply to adopt Beauregard at Twotailzrescue.org!!\n",

He gets along with other dog and cats his only problem is he tries to herd them out the door by nipping there heels. He doesn't mean it to be mean but some dogs do not like it to much. I think he would do best in home with older children. He is neutered, current of rabies, vaccines heartworm negative on preventative, and microchipped. If you would like to meet this beautiful boy you can call or text 816-809-0217 or email wigglebuttsrescue@yahoo.com. Don't wait to long on this guy he will get adopted quickly he is a handsome young man.",

This was because he was undersocialized and not given clear direction in his previous home.\n\nHowever, it only took about a week for him to get comfortable with the group and integrate with the other dogs. Now, he is learning social skills and gaining more confidence each day! He is also crate trained, potty trained, and knows his basic commands.\n\nHe did have food aggression when he first came as well, but we have since trained it out of him by hand feeding. Nevertheless, he has struggled with behavioral issues in the past, so he would do best in a home with and experienced owner who can continue to give him the proper guidance. \n\nHe is up to date on all his vaccines, had a clean medical check up in June, and is ready to find his fur-ever home!\n\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER HOME WITH AN EXPERIENCED OWNER TO HANDLE ANY ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE WITH HIS FOOD AGGRESSION\n",

            "description": "Pogo is a shy 2 year old Chihuahua/Dachshund mix. \n\nFrom the TX foster: He is a pretty scared boy and will need a patient foster/adopter. He gets scared on a leash inside and pancakes, but he gets better when we go on walks around the ranch. He must be walked with a good thick slip lead with a leash attached to his harness. He is a flight risk, but will chill out if we are sitting outside. He enjoyed sitting on my lap yesterday when we were under the patio watching the rain. He has met several other dogs and been fine, but he doesn't seek interaction with them yet but can coexist. Pogo will sniff and allow to be sniffed. He seems to do well when he hangs in the crate in the kitchen where he can see the most human interaction. He likes shredded cheese! \n\nPlease note that he cannot be outside without a leash. He won't be able to be caught if he gets loose. I have had him on a leash the whole time. He will need an experienced handler that is familiar with scared dogs. If someone can show him that people aren't all that bad and can teach him to trust, he will be okay. Just move slow with him when reaching for him. \n\nFrom his CO foster: I've had him for a little over a week now and his little personality is starting to come through! He's still very nervous and will definitely need a family who is willing to go slow and steady with him - no young kids - and preferably a home with a confident dog friend who can continue to help him feel safe and secure! He loves to snuggle and give kisses and his favorite thing to do is steal \"\"treasures\"\" from around the house and bring them back to his crate! The outside world is still terrifying for him, but he does great with potty pads and sleeps soundly in his crate at night. I can't wait to see more of his impish little personality come through more and more! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! We do have a lot of inquiries on a daily basis and also have approved applications on file.. Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! \nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoptions.\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

Chrissy unfortunately lost her sight about a week later and while initially she was very scared and confused, she has settled down and is adjusting to life without her vision. Her foster mum says she LOVES going for brisk leash walks but also enjoys quiet snuggling at home. Chrissy is a total foodie and enjoys a frozen peanut butter stuffed kong and other treat stuffed toys. Chrissy is quiet and friendly with other dogs but gets nervous if another dog barks or acts up so she would need a home with either another quiet pup or to be a solo pup.  Her home needs to have quiet and calm humans as well.  Chrissy requires daily eye drops so potential adopters need to be committed to a consistent schedule to keep her eyes comfortable and also be committed to continuing to work with her to adjust to her vision loss. Chrissy is a sweet and happy girl looking for her forever home and a family to help her live her best life.",

You can call me whatever you want, really, as long as you are holding a treat. \n\n\nI am a four-year-old mixed breed girl dog, and my Mom thinks I am the most gorgeous girl - inside and out. I get attached to my humans very quickly, and like to be in the same room as them, especially when there is a kiss or cuddle for the taking. My Mom and Dad work from home, and I lay quietly on my bed (with my squeaky duck) or their office floor (in the sun) while they do what they do... unless I need a wee, in which case I poke my nose through the crook of Mom's arm. I am sweet-tempered, good-natured, and so loving. A-gre-sif and grum-py are not in my vocab, but I do growl at thunder, and bark at unfamiliar noises to warn or protect my humans. I am very energetic and goofy, will make you laugh out loud when I do zoomies or chase my tail, luuurve walks or playing tug-of-war with my squeaky rope toy, and will be a great fitness partner. I am house-trained, know the \"come\" and \"sit\" commands, stand perfectly still when I get washed, and am good on a leash and harness.\n\n\nI am a little scared of raised voices and hands, and still learning how to behave like a dog that is living their best life, so I need forever humans willing to be patient, stick to a routine, and give me lots of unconditional love. I will be happiest in a home with children over 12 or adults; other chilled dogs that will be my pack and teach me to just be a pup and play; and with a fenced-in yard. The CASPCA has made sure that I am spayed, microchipped, and have had all my shots. \n\n\nPlease will you be my forever human and give me my forever home?\n\n\nLots (and lots and lots) of licks, \n\n\nRihanna Primary Color: Black Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 53.2lbs Age: 4yrs 6mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nMaddy and Kiki were rescued in Texas. Maddy had litter after litter of puppies in a rural area and rarely showed herself. When her puppies would become mobile and emerge from hiding, rescue groups would save them, but they had a difficult time catching Maddy.  Maddy frequented the same people's porches for food each night. When it was determined Maddy was pregnant again,  a trap was set and she was thought to be caught..only it wasn't Maddy in the trap...it was her daughter Kiki, who noone knew existed, but was also pregnant. \n\nA second trap was set for the real Maddy, and she was caught as well. \n\nBoth Maddy and Kiki had their puppies in foster care and they found amazing homes. Now we hope they find special people to love them, so that they can have a happy ending of their own.   \n\nWe hope that their own families can be found soon, as they have been living in a boarding facility for the past several months.  They were in a board and train program within the boarding facility, so that a trainer could work with them intensely on socialization and leash walking.  Both girls have come a long way, and Maddy now actively seeks out attention, wags her tail in excitement to see someone familiar, and follows those she knows well around. \n\nKiki was always the more fearful of the two, because she was born in the forest and noone even knew she existed until she was trapped. Maddy and Kiki must be adopted together, as they find great comfort in each other. Kiki looks to Maddy for confidence.  Kiki is now comfortable walking on a leash.\n\nBoth dogs are submissive to a fault with other dogs, people and cats. They are extremely quiet and non-demanding, but are very grateful dogs with cute mannerisms. They must go to a home with a secure fence.  We hope we can find someone to gift these girls with a home of their own. \n\nMaddy and Kiki are up to date on vaccinations, spayed and dewormed. \nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and fill out an application.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

We assume she was born with the deformed front legs because they don't bother her but she isn't going to be a long distance runner. They kinda look like they belong on a basset hound. She was an owner surrender because her owner had passed away and the family didn't want her. Baby is really friendly and we have had her around other dogs and she does fine with them. She is spayed, current on her vaccinations and microchipped.\n\nPLEASE e-mail (do not call) mike@caaronline.org for more information and to set up an appointment to adopt. Do not e-mail us with a request to call you, if you have a question please ask in the e-mail.\n\nAll dog are adopted on a first come - first served basis.\n\nCentral Arizona Animal Rescue is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 corporation.\n\nWe are located in San Tan Valley, AZ.\n\nIf you have other dogs already, you must bring them for introduction prior to adoption.\nFollow us on Facebook - www.facebook.com/CentralArizonaAnimalRescue\n\nWE DO NOT TAKE OWNER SURRENDERS - If you are looking to surrender a dog, take them to the county animal control in the county you reside in. That is where we get all of our dogs we are trying to save.",

And it\u2019s a lot of them. \nShe is a very well trained, medium energy dog. A nice walk  in the morning and a few tosses of the ball in the afternoon and she\u2019s ready to nap on the couch the rest of the day, no need to crate. Great on leash and loves car rides. \nFreya enjoys playing with her foster dog siblings and is quickly learning her manners on when to give them some space. She has not lived with cats in her foster home but did very well when she sees them at the vet and think she will be fine with all other pets if introduced properly. \nFreya needs a little work on her barking but is learning very quickly. She wants to let you know if there is someone here or wants your attention but her foster parents are teaching her other ways to communicate more quietly. She\u2019s a smart girl who wants to make her family happy and loves training. Freya did well meeting kids but is not incredibly graceful and loves the climb into your lap so it\u2019s recommended her home have kids over the age of 6. \nAt 55 lbs, she still has a few to gain to get her figure back. Freya has had some hard times in her past but it hasn\u2019t broken her sweet spirit. Her silky soft fur is growing back where the fleas had bitten her up. Her teeth shows signs of biting to get out of a kennel but overall this in one happy healthy girl who deserves the best home.",

            "description": "Sage is a Husky and Australian shepherd mix who is so pretty he can stop traffic. He's ~60 lbs, and has ample soft white, black, and champagne colorings. His thick black eye-liner makes his blue eyes pop-out. Don't be alarmed that his good looks are intimidating \u2014 the tip of Sage's tongue is often peeking out, giving him a goofy relaxed look.\n\nHe is 1.5 years old, and a very active dog. Multiple brisk walks a day are needed to exercise his body, and plenty of enrichment activities and a decompression walk to stimulate his mind.\n\nSage is gregarious and loves meeting other dogs! He has shown himself to be socially savvy, and has made friends with dogs young, old, and even some who were at first intimidated by his size (he lay down to be at their level).\n\nEven Though Sage loves playing with other dogs, he should be the only dog in the home and needs a home with no children under 12 years old because he has demonstrated some resource guarding. \n\nSage has the body of an adult but the mind of a puppy. He still has some puppy tendencies, like jumping and mouthing when he gets excited or frustrated so he needs a lot of redirection to alternative behaviours.\n\nSage has been through a lot of changes in the past 6 months which has been stressful. Sage will need time to fully relax and decompress in a new home. A very consistent and predictable schedule will be essential for Sage's wellbeing as he makes what we hope will be his last adjustment into a forever home. Even Though Sage will need LOTS of patience while he settles into his new home, this beautiful boy has a winning personality and unlimited potential.\n\nSage will be placed only in a household that has breed experience or is willing to do the research and understand the needs of a typical Husky, and where he would not join a household with small children (under 12), small animals or another dog.\n\nDo you think Sage is the right husky for you?

The vets office informed of that he is about 1 year old! He is now enjoying playing with the other young dogs in our care at our woodland sanctuary in Orangeburg, SC. \n\nGus is very playful, but can sometimes play too rough with other dogs, but with the right training he can be broken from that. He is very loving, sweet and just wants attention and affection! Please consider Gus when looking for your next family member or companion!\n\n",

The thing is I have had a pretty rough life before I got to the shelter. No one really knows except me but the shelter people knew because I was so very thin and scared of everything. It took a very long time before I started gaining weight and even longer to trust the people there. They knew I wanted to be a good girl by my soulful eyes. I am an American bulldog mix and a pretty big girl even though I still need to gain some more weight. I am still working on trusting people but doing better every day. I love to play outside and love my squeaky ball when I\u2019m in my kennel. I like most other dogs unless they get near my food. I like my food so much because I haven\u2019t always had much. I would love to have a person of my own that will be patient with me and help me get over my fear. I would do best without small children because they are loud and fast and scare me. Ask for Sara if you are my person.\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL. You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application. \n\nhttps://rockinprescue.org/adopting-a-dog/available-dogs/\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

I do like to follow my nose as most hounds do and will need to be kept safely in the yard when I'm spending time outside.  I will probably be fine with most dogs but cats are a little iffy for me. I am on medication because I have cluster seizures.  I love all people and will thoroughly enjoy family life.  While I want to be a much loved member in your home, it's possible that I've never spent time in a house before so be prepared to train me on what it's like to live indoors.  Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting a pet from our shelter, the process begins with a visit to our shelter to meet the pet of your interest. After meeting the pet, if you decide that the pet is a good match for you and your family, you must then fill out an adoption application. There is no fee to fill out the adoption application. The application must be filled out entirely. Incomplete applications will not be processed. Once you have completed and submitted your application, the application screening process usually takes 2-3 days to complete. Please note that we take multiple applications per pet. Each application is reviewed and the validity of all of the information listed by the applicant is verified. Our goal is to place each pet with a forever home that best suits that particular pet\u2019s needs, therefore we do not do first come first serve adoptions. If your application is the one chosen to adopt the pet, we will contact you and set up a time for you to come in and finalize the paperwork, pay the adoption fee, and pick up your new pet. \n\nName: Cookie\nAge: ~1/2 years\nSex: Female\nBreen: Pitbull Terrier Mix\nActive, friendly with people, NOT good with cats, NOT good with other dogs\n\nNOTE: In regards to children and pets, it is always best to remember that while pulling, tugging, poking, and pinching are all normal behaviors of a small child exploring the things around him, these behaviors can become frustrating for animals to tolerate. In response to pain or becoming overly annoyed, ANY animal can be subject to BITE, The pet and human relationship is an amazing bond that all pet lovers of all ages should be able to experience. As animal advocates and animal lovers, we want that experience to be an enjoyable one for every family that acquires a pet, therefore we always strongly recommend that parents/custodians of children (1) always monitor the interactions of their pets and their children, (2) never leave small children unattended with pets, (3) spend quality time teaching children how to be gentle with pets, respect the pet's personal space, and recognize behaviors that, even if they are not intended to be, are indeed bothersome to the animal and (4) be willing to set boundaries for children against behaviors that may be perceived by the pet as being annoying, fretful, or painful. Never underestimate the willingness of an animal to set boundaries on what it will not tolerate. When the responsibility of boundary setting is put upon the animal, it is usually carried out by nipping, snapping, and biting.\nRemember, YOU are the parent/custodian and YOU are the pack leader and thus YOU are the one responsible for making sure your \"kiddos,\" both two- legged and four, can live happily, safely, and harmoniously together.\n\nIf you are interested in making Cookie a part of your family, please give us a call at 804-520-9397 to schedule an appointment to come and meet her!",

We are providing a service to Del Norte County Animal Control to help with adoption. Please contact the shelter directly if you are interested in meeting or adopting this dog--their info is below.\n\n\nMeet Indio! He's some kind of Lab mix, about 3 years old! Indio's a big guy, with lots of energy, and loves to play! He can be a little careful, at first, but warms quickly! Indio needs a home where he will be the only dog, with no small children. He enjoys his walks, loves to play fetch, knows how to \"sit\" and enjoys affection. Indio has a strong prey drive, and will chase/hunt wildlife, so he needs a secure yard where he won't get into trouble! \n\n\nBorn Again Pit Bull Rescue (BAPBR) regularly works with the wonderful volunteers at the Del Norte County Animal Control Shelter located out in rural Crescent City, CA (a small coastal town on the OR/CA border). They have a very small shelter with small indoor 3x6 kennel runs, low foot traffic, odd adoption viewing hours and it rains a lot which means the dogs can't always come outside to play--so we want YOU to see some of their really great dogs that they have up for adoption. It's only a short 5-hour drive from Portland to adopt your new family member!\n\nDel Norte County Animal Control is located in Crescent City, CA. They are open Monday thru Friday from 8am to 5pm. They are closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAddress: 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531\n\nShelter phone: (707) 464-7235\n\nAdoption fee: $ 75.00\n\nEmail: delnortedogs@gmail.com\n\nFind them on Facebook: www.facebook.com/DNdogs707  \u201cDogs of Del Norte County\u201d",

He's not fond of groomers and vets and will need to be muzzled/sedated for his future grooming. Louie is looking for an experienced Lhasa lover that understands the breeds' quirks and will give him the respect and reverence he believes he is due. Adults only, and best in a home with just one person who can take time to bond with him.

His favorite hobbies include rolling in the grass, going for walks, playing fetch and he loves to swim, seriously, we think he's half fish!\n\nRaul came to us as a stray likely after being left unattended and happened to get lost. Unfortunately, his people never showed up to get this sweet guy and take him back home.\n\nHe loves his walks and makes these adorable snorts like a cute little piggy while sniffing everything (because, ya know, everything needs a good Raul inspection). You will never run out of laughs or good times with his goofy spirit!\nWhile Raul loves every human that he encounters, he can become reactive to other dogs, primarily males at our facility. He seems to make friends with some of the females here but would likely be happiest in a home where he is the only pet receiving all your affection. \n\nHe is looking for a family a bit more on the active side. He really enjoys his time out and about, running around. Unfortunately, he just doesn't get the adequate time he truly deserves and needs to release his energy here at the shelter. Keeping him active will help to keep him physically healthy and keep his mind stimulated.\n\nThrough positive reinforcement and training we know Raul will flourish with a family that will give him the time, respect, and love that this sweet couch potato so incredibly deserves.\n\nRaul is excited about the possibility of finding a loving family that will make him a big part of their life. If you're the adventurous type looking for an outdoor companion, Raul is your guy!\n\n\nBorn Again Pit Bull Rescue (BAPBR) regularly works with the wonderful volunteers at the Del Norte County Animal Control Shelter located out in rural Crescent City, CA (a small coastal town on the OR/CA border). They have a very small shelter with small indoor 3x6 kennel runs, low foot traffic, odd adoption viewing hours and it rains a lot which means the dogs can't always come outside to play--so we want YOU to see some of their really great dogs that they have up for adoption. It's only a short 5-hour drive from Portland to adopt your new family member!\n\nDel Norte County Animal Control is located in Crescent City, CA. They are open Monday thru Friday from 8am to 5pm. They are closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAddress: 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531\n\nShelter phone: (707) 464-7235\n\nAdoption fee: $ 75.00\n\nEmail: delnortedogs@gmail.com\n\nFind them on Facebook: www.facebook.com/DNdogs707  \u201cDogs of Del Norte County\u201d",

I got rescued by my new friends at FIDO and now they got me living with this trainer and all her friends.   They tell me I'm a Coonhound mixed with Horse and Locomotive!  Not sure what that means but at 2 years old and 90 lbs and a nose that leads me everywhere, I guess I can be quite a handful.   Well geez folks give me a break....I've never had any training and these ladies seem bound and determined to make me learn my manners, HA!   They tell me I' m very trainable but a little stubborn so my adopters have to be someone with large breed experience and people who are very active.  A fenced in yard is needed for me for sure and no young kids b/c I'd knock them over as I don't understand my size and strength..  I'm learning how to play like a gentleman with other dogs too here. Big dogs are great but no small dogs or cats b/c I think I have what they call prey drive - I am a hunting breed ya know!.   Can't wait to tell ya all about what I'm learning.   Adoption fee 125.00\n\nUPDATE 10/20.....man is this training this a blast. I have doggo friends and I am learning that if I listen I am allowed to do so much more fun stuff.  My trainer mom says I am doing so wonderfully and becoming a true gentleman.  I am so good in her house with her other dogs.  Very calm and obedient she says.  I think she likes me HA!",

Hope thats ok?\n\nFoster mom says I look like a baby giraffe thats just learning how to walk when I run. Im a lean, tall boy thats sometimes a little uncoordinated.

She loves to play with other dogs and adores all people and kids! Bella was rescued out of the shelter super pregnant. She had her puppies about a week later. Bella had 14 puppies, sadly only 1 survived after a ton of work from volunteers and vets trying all that we could. Side note: The one puppy is adopted and doing wonderful. Bella is light heartworm positive. She is currently on the slow kill treatment. Her adoption donation is $250 and that includes her spay, yearly shots, heartworm test, dewormings, and a microchip as well as her heart treatment.

            "description": "Kayla\nFemale\nLabrador Retriever / American Pit Bull Terrier mix\nBorn 2010\n\nContact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com for more information about Kayla.\n\nKayla came to NMAF as an owner surrender when her mom suddenly passed away.  She and doggie sister, Hannah, were 2 of 6 dogs needing to be rehomed as a result.  Hannah will remain with her new foster, but we are seeking a new home for Kayla.  Her foster mom, Karon, writes this about Kayla:\n\n\"I love this dog.  She is so good, well-behaved, happy, and gets along with everyone.  Just started testing with the cat.  Will have to see on that one.  (Update:  kitty testing is continuing and doing well.)  She can be contained in a kennel (don't want to pull out my huge crate again as it is packed away, so can't speak to a crate, but she won't need a crate), but no problem leaving her in a kennel or garage if I leave.  She figured out the doggie door after watching Hannah a few times.  Comes at a run when called with a big grin on her face.  Not pushy, just all in all a great girl.\"\n\nKayla has some stiffness in her hind end so NMAF will have that evaluated, and she is already on a joint supplement.  She is up-to-date on shots and microchipped.  When she came to her first home from Animal Humane in 2013, she was touted as a sweet and friendly dog - which she still is today!  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Kayla, a visit can be set up.  We are asking potential adopters to submit an application, found at www.nmaf.org/adopt/adoption-application, for review first.  There is no commitment or guarantee for adoption.  Please send it to the person listed above for review and someone will get back to you within 24 hours.\n\nBecause home visits are required, NMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

            "description": "This big-headed hunk was originally found running as a stray along a very busy road :O( We don't know what or where he was running from ... we're just grateful he ran into the arms of STAF. Spud is right around 2 years old and 65 beefy pounds. \n\nOne of our biggest bully-loving volunteers has taken the big guy under her wing. This from her: \"When we first started going out together he didn't know what a lot of things were--statues, bikes, etc. But he wasn't reactive, just curious. He can get rowdy and jump when excited, but seems mostly like a gentle giant that still has a lot of puppy in him. Spud is always well behaved when we are out, never barks, growls or reacts at all to other dogs or people. He doesn't pull on the leash. He is quiet in the car and usually just plays with his toys.\"\n\nSpud is very receptive to learning and is excellent with \"sit\", \"stay\" and \"leave it\". When he first arrived at our shelter, he had trouble containing his excitement. His enthusiasm often manifested in jumping and grabbing the leash/harness, making it a real challenge to get him suited up for walks. He's gotten better, but (as demonstrated on a trial home visit with a prospective home) he still has his \"crazy bouts\" when he wants/needs exercise and attention, or something sets him off. (Like his reflection in a mirror.) \n\nSpud will fare best in a lower-key, but very active family with lots of walks and yard playtime. He's not a fan of in-your-face kinds of dogs, but would benefit from the company of a more laid-back playmate. \n\nIf you have a soft spot for the bully kind, you will melt for this guy. He is very comfortable in a home setting, and is a good boy when provided with a daily outlet for his energy, and a calm, confident handler. Again, a fenced yard and another playful (but not over-the-top) dog buddy would be perfect. His family should be up (both mentally and physically) to handling his size, youth and occasional rowdiness. Please visit www.STAF.org for additional information on our adoption process. \n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n",

If you would like to try a Foster to Adopt trial, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nIf you are only interested in temporarily Fostering one of our rescues, please fill out a Foster Application.\n\nUPDATE 9-16-20:At this time we can only assume Matty has some serious trust issues towards humans and this is why he would not allow anyone to touch him on the day of his rescue. Consequently, every time he goes through a change (i.e. meeting new people or changing his foster home), he becomes protective and weary of the situation. This brings out his fearful reaction, which means he can be a \"fear biter.\" He arrived in his new San Diego foster home and it was hard to get him out of his crate. He was growling and trying to bite. Thankfully his foster is experienced in dog handling and in reading dog behavior. His crate is his \"protective area\" where he feels safe from change, but his experienced foster was able to remove him safely. It took about an hour before his foster could safely touch him. After an easy going, slow introduction, he started to trust her and within minutes enjoyed and sought attention to be petted. We can tell he enjoys being loved on, but will have a hard time with new things, probably for awhile.The best home for Matty would be:\n\nExperienced dog owner - Matty will NOT be a good pup for a first-time dog owner\nNO children - especially under the age of 14\nEither no other dogs, or a home with dog(s) that do not come on too strong - Matty gets annoyed by pups that want to get in his face to play, so he would be happy as the only dog or if his dog sibling(s) are mellow\nAvailable crate for Matty to relax in - he seems to be very fond of his crate, which is a good thing\n\nMatty has an appointment to be neutered on Tuesday, 9/22. He should go into a foster-to-adopt home for 2 weeks and his foster/potential adopter needs to be aware for the potential for nipping, although he has not done so with his current foster. Please do not apply if the description above does not apply to you.ORIGINAL RESCUE STORY:Meet Matty! This handsome little guy was found wandering in the streets of Tijuana, scared to death and running in between traffic. He was extremely matted and hence his hair had to go. We think Matty is a young adult between 1-2 years old and is currently under 15 pounds. He is likely a Poodle/Bichon/Maltese mix. Matty can be very shy and weary of humans and it takes him time to allow people to touch him. In fact, it took several people to corner him in the streets of Tijuana in order to rescue and help him. Once he was initially in their care, he stayed at arms length. However, after a few days he learned to trust people and enjoys jumping on the lap of the person he trusts. He is very dog friendly and we think he will likely be good around cats too. Because of his weariness, we do not know how he will do around young children, as he may be scared and uncomfortable with fast movements. Matty is now in San Diego and we will update his biography as soon as we get to learn more about him. If you would like to meet this handsome little guy, please submit a dog adoption application online at arwob.orgIf you would like to meet one of our animals, PLEASE fill out an adoption application.\n\nDog Adoption Application\n\nCat Adoption Application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nIF YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY\nplease fill out a short questionnaire in addition to the adoption application.\n\nMilitary Questionnaire",

It never seems to end. This handsome boy is about 5 years young and 65 pounds. Kane has not warmed up to too many other pups at the shelter and will do best as an only pet (not cat tested) with a fenced and/or private yard.

Banisha wasn't receiving the exercise and interaction a husky needs so they reached out to us and as they say the rest is history.  Our vets noticed right away that she was blind in one of her eyes and suffering from a painful form of glaucoma in the same eye.  So to relieve her pain, the eye was removed.  But believe us it doesn't bother her.  Actually she is feeling much better.  Banisha is a little shy with new humans but loves, loves, loves other dogs.  So she is settling in at one of our \"pro\" fosters and learning that people can be great plus how to be part of a pack.",

            "description": "Bella Ragazza, means a beautiful girl in Italian, and she is exactly that!! Bella is a sweet 6 year old golden retriever girl who loves to chase a ball and will even bring it back a good deal of the time. She is housebroken and is eager to learn more on how to walk better on a leash. Bella is not fond of sharing treats or food with other dogs, so works out best if she has a family's attention all to herself. \n\nBella was be completely vetted thanks to your donations, including vaccinations, heartworm tested, and extra blood work to check for a thyroid issue to make sure everything looks good. \n\nBella entered Golden Retriever Rescue Resource, GRRR due to a divorce we were told. She was in a foster-to-adopt home she was just fine for sometime, until she snapped at the owner when getting brushed. Bella likes to show she is in charge. We are looking for a dog savvy owner, who will take her to training from day one and work with her through some \"I'm in charge\" biting issues.\n\nWe are currently searching for a special foster family who can help Bella. She is currently boarded because we all have dogs and Bella does need to be the only dog in the home. If you qualify with our adoption policies, please write us immediately at grrradoption@yahoo.com after you review our adoption policies to begin discussion.\n\nTo adopt a Golden that you see here, please go to the Golden Retriever Rescue Resource website at www.gr-rescue.org  Read our adoption policies. If you qualify for this dogs adoption and the adoption policies, please write us for an adoption application at grrradoption@yahoo.com  Please provide your city and zip code. Please note, we only adopt to select areas within Ohio, Michigan and Indiana where we can do a home visit by a trusted volunteer. \n\nPlease read our adoption policies on our website prior to inquiring for an adoption application. Thank you!",

Fowler needs some positive one-on-one attention and is still working on his basic commands. He\u2019s very much still a puppy in a big body. He weighs approximately 50lbs and has some anxiety caused by his previous situation. Despite the challenges he\u2019s faced in his short life thus far, he\u2019s a sweet boy who loves to cuddle and play fetch. Fowler is partial to females, both human and canine. He would likely do best in a home as an only pet or with one other submissive dog. Fowler is house-broken and mostly crate trained. \n \nExtra Tidbits:\n- He enjoys the white noise machine while he\u2019s crated\n- We\u2019ve been working on leash training with an easy walk harness. \n- VERY food motivated\n\n***TO ADOPT, PLEASE GO TO eunoiarescue.org/adopt***",

I am handsome and yet I have been a challenge to the people who wnat to own me. I need a fenced yard, someone who is a strong leader and will correct me when needed. I am a good dog inside the house and crated trained and housebroken, but I am needing an only dog home. I cannot be a dog park dog and I cannot be left to roam acres of land. I will stay in the boundaries no matter what. I am good out on walks on a leash with other dogs approaching but the ideal setting is a physically fenced yard . I am terroritial about my owners and family. I have been made to feel that I need to protect my people from an intruder that is not wanted. If you need to put me up when company comes it is fine..... but I need a loving home where I can devote my whole being to being your protector and your true love. I know all sorts of commands and I am smart. I love to go on car rides and if you take me places on a leash I will be fine if you hold me close and tight. I love children... doesn't that count!?

This boy is happy, intelligent and needs a big privacy fenced yard and someone who will let him know who wears the pants in the family. At 40 pounds, this boy has energy and just wants to find a good challenge in life on a daily basis. He is curious, loves people but hates being confined and crates are not a good idea for him. He is pretty good with other dogs but would not need to be living with an alpha dog. You can see that happy smile on his face and understand that he could be a bright spot in your life if you understand where he is coming from in life. We would prefer a none child environment and probably no cats. We just cannot assure that he is good with a cat.\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

She is not one that will go on walks or hikes. She needs a fenced in backyard, no apartments, no condos, no townhouses will work for her. While Diva is mostly blind when you are not looking she will take herself for a walk down the street. Diva does not walk on a lead at all. She spins as she walks. We believe it was a nuerological issue that happened when she was born. She prefers lighted toys, squeeky toys, and crinkle toys. She loves to sleep under the covers but is apprehensive of new places and new people since she cannot see well but what once she gets her surroundings she is a lover. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY. We do not have a facility that the public can come and view our pets at.",

She started her life off in horrendous conditions but doesn't let that effect her effervescent personality. She would do best in an older child home. Her size can be a bit much for younger children. No cats and a dog test would need to be done before going home with another. Hae is a rare breed called a Tosa Inu. Researching this breed would be recommended before applying for adoption.",

I'm just a big sweet love bug that wants attention and hugs!\n\nI love to go on walks or short jogs, but best walked by adults bc I'm pretty strong.  My foster family has 7 kids starting at age 4 and I'm gentle with them without knocking them down or jumping!  One boy even likes to play wrestle with me, so I'll gently butt my head against him, but won't bite.\n\nNew people? No problem! I put my head down and let them pet me. Toys and fetch are ok, but I'd rather just follow around my family...\n\nI'm friendly with most other dogs, given a slow introduction.  Please feed me separately, though, because I don't like to share my food. \n\nI need a little work on my commands, as well as some potty training.  I do love to scratch my body against the couch -- speaking of scratches, yes, please!...right there....behind my ear, or on my chest, or how about a good head rub?!\n\nMy activity level matches the activity in the house. I play when they play, walk around with them, or sit when they watch TV.\n\nDon't you just want to take me home and love me furever??",

I am a sweet, playful boy who really enjoys a good lap to cuddle in.  I also love taking walks and riding in the car with you.  If you must leave home, I will jump for joy upon your return, even if you just went out to get the mail.  I promise I will never make a mess or chew anything inappropriate.  I had heartworm which was treated however, I have other issues with my heart and require daily medication.  You would not know I had a heart problem if I did not tell you!  I prefer a quiet home, or a home with older children.   I would do best in the suburbs and therefore, I am not a candidate for city living.  I am getting lots of love and attention in my foster home.  Will you take me home and spoil me?  \nIf you are interested in this dog, please submit an application directly to our website at www.ny-petrescue.org.  Only applications submitted directly to Petrescue will be considered.\n\n",

            "description": "Sweet Bailey came to us as a young puppy in January of 2020. She and her littermates were extremely unsocialized with little to no human interaction. She has spent time in foster with one of our trainers receiving socialization and is now ready for a loving home. Bailey is currently 9 months old and weighs 33lbs. Bailey has made wonderful strides and now wants all the love from the people in her \"circle\". She is super mischievous and loves to play tricks on her people friends. She has even stolen the shoe off of her foster's foot when she wasn't paying enough attention to her!! An ideal home for Bailey is one that is calm and consistent with other dogs and a fenced in yard. \n\nBailey still has some quirks that her adopter will need to be aware of and feel comfortable managing. She is not a fan of strangers, but if they ignore her she will come around on her own terms. She loves other dogs, but can be stingy with her toys etc... until they are buddies. We would love it for Bailey's future adopter to be able to meet her a couple times before taking her home to make sure she is comfortable! \n\nIf you think that Bailey is a good fit for your home, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nPlease review our Adoption Process before filling out an application. If you would like to try a Foster to Adopt trial, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nIf you are only interested in temporarily Fostering one of our rescues, please fill out a Foster Application.\n\nMeet Aspen!!NOTE: Aspen will be loosing her foster family as of 11/19/20 and will return to her boarding in Tijuana if we cannot find a foster, foster-to-adopt, or adoptive family. Sadly, she isn't the dog for everyone, as she will likely need an experienced dog owner. Her adopter will need strong dog leadership skills and they must know how to be a good observer and handler. Aspen is not an \"off the leash at the dog park\" kind of dog. She is \"dog selective,\" which means she is not going to be friends with all dogs, but she is also not going to try to attack them while on leash, nor bark/lunge at them when she has a dog encounter while walking or hiking. She ignores other dogs for the most part. Aspen's ideal home will likely be one who is looking for just one family dog and has no cats. She does love humans!! Although she has met children on/off leash and has at times been sweet to them, a home without small children would likely be the best for her. This ideal home can sometimes include playtime with some dogs she considers friends. Providing dog training from the start would be perfect and her new foster or adopter will be able to talk with her current foster to see what type of training has already been done. Medically, Aspen is super healthy! Even though she may be 6 years old and is happy/content with being calm, she can also be pretty active/energetic and would make a great hiking buddy and enjoys long walks. Her blood work is great and she recently had a dental treatment, including removing her canine teeth and several other teeth that were fractured from the time before she was rescued.UPDATE 10-31- 20: Here is what Aspen's foster family has to say about her:'Aspen seemed to have some anxiety when she first arrived at our home and would whine by the door or in her crate or pant a lot, but with a little love and affection she quickly adjusted and learned the rules fast. She responds very well to \"no\" and knows which areas she's not allowed in. She did well with formal training and learned how to not pull on the leash and walk nicely by your side, but you will need to be consistent with it. Getting her to sit off leash with a verbal command is difficult as she is not food driven and will not sit for treats. She only sits when she is on leash by your side with a gentle reminder by pulling up on the leash. Sometimes I think she does not like to sit because of her hip (you will notice she sits off to one side). She enjoys eating leaves from the garden and human food (cooked veggies, rice, sweet potato) over dog food, I think because they're soft and easier to chew. She eats hard dog food very slowly because she is missing several teeth, so maybe soft treats and soft food would be better for her. Aspen sleeps nicely in her crate every night and will go to her crate on her own throughout the day, however she will resist if she knows you are leaving. Sometimes she will run to a corner or under the bed if you tell her to go to her place, but this can easily be fixed with consistent training on leash (when her leash is on, she goes to her place on command). She is not super destructive but has lightly chewed on a few items that were in the yard (boxing glove and yoga mat), but they weren't destroyed or anything (again, probably has to do with her missing some teeth). She also responds well to \"no\" if you see her try to grab something or if you correct her for trying to chew on something.Aspen is very independent and likes to explore outside. She has gotten under the house several times by moving a potted plant that was blocking the crawlspace, so make sure there are no holes because she will find it. Several times she has also bolted out of the door when we came home, but if you chase her and yell after her she immediately stops and rolls over on her back. Despite her being a little mischievous at times, she is the absolute sweetest. Even though she likes all people and gets along great with everyone, she has attached onto me and will follow me around everywhere. She likes to sleep under my side of the bed and it has become her spot whenever I'm in bed, or she wants to get away from everyone. She is dominant with other dogs, but lives with a male staffy rescue we brought home a couple weeks after getting Aspen. He is about 3 years old and a little shorter but stockier than her. He gets along with all dogs, has a very playful attitude and they are best buddies now, even sleeping with each other on occasion. When we brought him home we made sure to introduce them in a neutral area and crate rotate them for the first day. We also had a third dog we brought home that same night, a 1-year-old large pit mix with special needs that we temporarily watched for another rescue. It took her an extra day to warm up to him as he did not believe in personal space and would often times get too close to her where she would nip at him. But with constant monitoring and quick corrections if she was being mean, she eventually allowed him into the pack although she still kept her distance most of the time. Naturally, she would get jealous if I pet any of the other dogs and would come over and sit in front of me, so if there are other dogs in the house make sure to be as neutral as possible and share the love equally.Aspen has been great with all people and is extremely friendly with everyone who has come over to the house. However she did growl twice at children when she was crated and they were running by. I think those were isolated incidents because she was upset that she had to stay in the crate and the kids were playing and screaming. While I'm confident that she can be around children, I do see her being possibly too high-energy around smaller kids.Overall Aspen has been the perfect foster daughter. She even has a secret poop corner away from our nice garden and turf, which was nice and made it easy to pick up after her. She is very swe\nTo meet Aspen, please submit an adoption or foster application online at arwob.orgIf you would like to meet one of our animals, PLEASE fill out an adoption application.\n\nDog Adoption Application\n\nCat Adoption Application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nIF YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY\nplease fill out a short questionnaire in addition to the adoption application.\n\nMilitary Questionnaire",

This animal is not in the care of Kitsap Humane Society and the staff at KHS cannot respond to any inquiries about this animal. If you are interested in adopting or learning more about this pet, please contact Kathryn at mailtokathryn@gmail.com. Kitsap Humane Society is not responsible for any present or future damage the pet may do to a person, animal, or property. We encourage all prospective adopters to do their own evaluation.\n\nAdopt Backup! Backup is about 6 years old and is an adorable pittie mix. Backup is a unique guy, as he is blind. He is very sweet with people, but can be startled by other pets. Backup is friendly and playful and enjoys romping around the fenced backyard. He is a very snuggly boy who enjoys lounging on the couch with you. Backup is house trained and will let you know when he needs to go out. Despite not being able to see, Backup is a smart guy who will find his way out if given the opportunity, so Backup should always be on leash or supervised when outdoors. Backup enjoys playing with toys. His favorite toy is his squeaky rubber chicken. He carries it with him everywhere! Backup does well when he is left alone, but loves to be with you when you are home. He is looking for a home where he is the only pet (no other dogs or cats) and where he has a securely fenced in yard. He would do best with kids over the age of 5, as he can be easily spooked by young kids. If you think Backup would be the perfect addition to your home, ask to meet him today! \n\nBackup needs a home with:\n- no other pets\n- a securely fenced in yard\n- kids over the age of 5 Primary Color: Red Age: 6yrs 4mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "****Bhodi will not be adopted to a home with small children due to the potential to bite.****\n\n~~Although we do our very best to make sure your new pup is in tiptop health before adoption,\nthings could drastically change a month later. Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** No obvious issues found during vet exam *****\n\nTemperament: Bodhi was caught in a trap meant for a wild animal and has never had a home before. He is really scared of humans and is still learning how to be a dog. It took weeks before Bodhi would let anyone touch him without losing a finger, but now that he has gotten to know his foster mom better, he will reluctantly let her rub his belly for a minute because he knows he'll get a treat when she's done. It took quite a while to get to this point, but he is learning.\n\nHe has learned to walk on a leash now, and he really enjoys the walks around the block. He is great with other dogs and likes to follow his doggy foster siblings around and do zoomies with them in the yard. We think he feels more safe and comfortable when there are other dogs around. He will do much better in a home with other dogs!\n\nHe loves playing outside and bringing out anything he can steal through the doggy door. He is very mischievous, and fast! He keeps a stash of fun toys outside including socks, shoes, bones, dog toys, water bottles, wallets, basically anything you might leave laying around.\n\nHe is mostly housebroken with the doggy door, but he does still have some tinkle accidents. Potty training will take time, just like everything else.\n\nSuccess has been slow, but we are definitely making progress on this cool dude. He is learning how to be a pet, but it will take someone with a lot of patience and time to work with him. He is definitely not a lap dog. And he would prefer someone who has a doggy door so he can go outside and play whenever he wants.\n\nBodhi was named after the coolest beach bum from the movie \"Point Break\" because he has ears that look like a surfer dude hair cut! He even has highlights.\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, please give Bodhi a chance. It won't be easy, but in the end, your hard work and patience will give you a lot of satisfaction. -\n\nWhere did he come from: He was caught in an animal trap out in the woods. Little did we know that Bodhi was actually a feral dog that had never been in a home before.\n\nAdoption: ***** $433.00 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 10 lbs.\nApproximate age: 11/6/2019\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

I am approx. 3 years old!\nI am really hoping to find a foster home or even better yet.... my forever home!! You see, I was surrendered by my family and I am not handling this kennel life very well.... it really stresses me out!! It makes me drool! So I am really looking forward to getting out of here and to a home of my very own!  I have all kinds of plans for us... we can go on walks, play in the yard and cuddle together with lots of pets and belly rubs involved! \nI am a very sweet and loving boy.  I'm pretty smart too!! I even know all of my basic commands.  I'm sure I could learn even more tricks if you were willing to teach me!! I aim to please!! I will need an adult home that is willing to work with me with my resource guarding \nI cannot go to a home with those little furry things you all call \"cats\".  I'm not too fond of them, but I am good to go to a home with dogs. \nI'm scared of storms.... but who isn't?  I would also need a fenced in yard that we can run and play in\nSoooo....If you think I could be the boy for you...... please fill out an adoption application at: \n                www.dawghous.com\nLove Skye",

Pepper, a female is his best friend, we\u2019re guessing around 9-10 yrs and a Shar Pei mix.    They are a little shy at first with new people, but oh so very sweet once you get to know them.  They get along really well, so we would like to keep them together as a bonded pair if possible.  They are active, healthy and enjoy being outside, but must be indoor dogs.  They are really a great pair.  Please consider making Otis and Pepper a new addition to your family.  They are currently living at the Pei Land adoption facility in Plano, IL.  Their adoption fee for the pair is $250.  You can request an adoption application form by email to : peachesash@aol.com",

She enjoys playing with other dogs but would need to be within playgroups in the training facility because she is a resource guarder. Lady is such a sweet dog that  loves to play and also really enjoys cuddling. \n\nThank you for your inquiry about a Dogs Unbroken dog. The dogs we take into our rescue were all at risk of being euthanized before they came to us \u2013 that may have been due to perceptions based on their breed or because they had displayed negative behaviors in the past. In all cases, we saw the potential in these Colorado dogs. While in our care, we start to work with the dogs to reward good behaviors and correct undesirable ones. Our placement program employs a Foster-to-Adopt process enabling you and the dog time to get to know each other and learn together.\n\n \n\nDuring the foster period, we require your participation in a mandatory, 8-week basic obedience class with an amazing trainer based in Longmont. This class is provided at no cost to you and uses a balanced training method, meaning you learn to only reward good behaviors and to identify and appropriately correct negative behaviors. In our experience, it\u2019s amazing to learn how to connect with your dog and see them figure out for themselves how to make appropriate choices. Upon successful completion of this class and payment of the adoption fee, we will transfer ownership and you will have continued training support for the life of your dog.\n\n \n\nIf you don\u2019t think you can participate in the training class or don\u2019t feel that a balanced approach to training is for you, then it would be best that you not spend the time needed to complete the application. However, if this process sounds like something you\u2019d be willing to commit to, we would be happy to answer any questions you may have.",

Dash is house and crate trained and a total lovebug to humans. Dash is looking for a home where he could be the one and only. Dash knows all of his basic commands and walks very well on a leash. He will require the following in order to adopt him. A fenced in yard. A family committed to continuing his training in obedience/social skills. No children under the age of 13 years. We will require a vet and home check before he is adopted.\n\nHail Mary Rescue, a 501c3 non profit, saves dogs from southeast Louisiana shelters. It is a foster-based rescue which gives pets the opportunity to live in home settings where they are house and crate trained, learn basic obedience commands, and are well socialized, many with children and other dogs. Exposure to cats depends on the foster's home. Adoption fee is $200. All dogs are completely vetted, vaccinated, spay/neutered, and micro-chipped prior to adoption. See your new best friend?

            "description": "Hey! Remember me? If you don't, let me refresh your memory! My name is Gotti and I'm a handsome, 8 year old, American Staffordshire Terrier mix. I was originally adopted from Animal Ark a while ago and now I'm back, through no fault of my own. My guardian was moving and I couldn't go along. The staff says I'm a very sweet guy who is easy going and walks well on leash. I haven't lived with cats or children and am somewhat reserved around other canines. I know some commands like \"sit and lay\". Even though it's nice here at the Shelter, I'm hoping I can get into my new home sooner rather than later. I would be a great candidate for a foster or foster to adopt home. Ask the staff for details.",

            "description": "Pretty Lucky is an older gal who hasn't had an easy life. \n\nWe\u2019re guessing she is around 8 years old and an American Bulldog mix. Lucky does well with LARGER dogs and kids, but we are not sure about cats. She was found in the streets of San Antonio in April 2018, pregnant, covered in open wounds and with her two front teeth missing, upper AND lower. After no treatment for her skin condition and a second litter of pups, Lucky was finally fostered by a rescuer in April 2019, who got her diagnosed properly with the autoimmune skin disease: Pemphigus Foliaceus. To keep her inflamed skin and bleeding feet at bay, Lucky must take a low dose of Prednisone daily for the rest of her life. Because of the steroids, this happy girl has ballooned to 100lbs. and takes RC Canine weight loss food (also prescription). Lucky also has a larger than life personality, wags a lot, jumps on the couch (in spite of her weight) and plays well with other big dogs. She is housebroken and kennel trained. Will you give this special girl a loving home and medical care furever? She will return your love tenfold. She is completely vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $250. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and FILL OUT AN APPLICATION if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee!",

He is a super friendly guy who needs a home that will meet his exercise needs while also using firm, consistent boundaries to keep him from getting over stimulated. The reward will be a loving, spunky, loyal pooch with a love of exploration, frisbee catching and licking food off the floor.

            "description": "With a striking resemblance to a baby hippo, it's hard to look away from this oh-so-cute bulldog mix. But alas, Digny has gone from being happy to greet every volunteer to only preferring a handful of them. Over time, Digny has been  closing the circle on letting new people come to know him, making it difficult to introduce him to potential adopters because he is so attached to the people he knows and trusts who are holding the leash. That isn't to say that Digny has stopped welcoming new people ... he is just a bit choosier than he used to be and patience and time are the key components.  Making eye contact with ease, Digny is approximately 55lbs., a low-rider who is happy, fun-loving and housebroken (Bonus!) who loves to play and run. Despite being an indisputable cutie, meeting new people continues to be a big challenge so only experienced dog lovers need apply. At a super-chill age of around 8 years old, He is a happy sitting on your lap for hours, making him a perfect companion for less active people . He has had training, and is selectively dog friendly after proper introductions.\n\nDIGNY, has just one focus - you!!  He is housebroken, knows commands, and walks well on a leash.  DIGNY gets along with most other dogs and enjoys all types of toys.  He is active and fun. \n\nApproved applicants receive priority.\nClick on the \"More About Us\" link to get to our \"Adoption Application\" link.\n\nEmail completed applications to: sandraschiller3008@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "Ely is available for foster or foster-to-adopt. He was one of six dogs willingly surrendered by hoarders. We got him out of the shelter the end of June. He is not for the faint-hearted. He is very very submissive, scared, shy - whatever word you choose to use. He is not going to be for the average person/family looking for a dog. He is used to women more than men, but he has been exposed to both. I would recommend no children at this time unless older. Patience and continuity are the key with this boy. I do consider him unsocialized and he has a ways to go. We are looking for someone or a family experienced with unsocialized dogs that are willing to work with him at HIS pace. And know when he can be pushed just an inch. He has come a long way from when I got him, but he has a ways to go. He is ready for the next step. We think he will make an excellent dock diver down the road.\n\nEly will need a home with other dogs that are kind and confident, not pushy or jealous. He needs a fenced yard, he still spooks easily. Most of all he needs someone with love, patience, some dog knowledge - oh, and did I say patience?? He sleeps on the bed with me at night and allows petting in that setting. I can pet him at times during the day if my movements and demeanor are not frenetic. He can pick up on your mood in a heartbeat. He takes food readily out of your hand. He can be groomed. He loves to play in water and does play with other dogs. He likes to dig. He is under my computer desk when I am working. He soooo wants to trust 100% but just is shy like a couple inches. He is off Trazadone and has been for over a month and doing well. He is housebroken and crate trained 100%. There are many more things we can talk about with Ely, but will save that for someone that is truly interested.\n\nEly is currently located in Bradenton. Please contact us if you are interested in him. He is a truly wonderful dog underneath the layers that are peeling away.

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Sapphire! Here is her video collage from NC: https://youtu.be/sZ4p_tBkWNs\n\nSapphire is 19 months old (approx. DOB 2-10-19), female, 50 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Sapphire was found as a homeless stray in NC. She is a gem! she will sit for treats and take them gently; all she wants is attention and affection but most of all a family to call her own! Sapphire absolutely loves people and tested well with other dogs at the shelter however she seems to prefer being the center of attention. She has medium energy, is potty trained, crate trained (likes the crate), Sapphire knows Sit Paw, Down and getting better with recall every day! Missy is an amazing, very sweet and loving dog and she deserves the absolute best in her future home! Her ideal home would be in a rural setting with a family or individual with an active lifestyle who will take her on long walks, hiking, and has time to exercise her every day. A home with a fenced in yard would be a bonus (but not required) for her as she LOVES to run around in the yard, play fetch, and needs daily exercise. While Missy is by and large a very well-behaved dog, she needs someone experienced with dogs who will be consistent in her training, particularly with leash training and being around cars. he loves people whether on or off leash and wants to say hello to everyone. She did well when we took her on Church Street. With dogs, at most she will just whine, but she hasn't been around a lot of dogs at one time while on leash. She has done well on leashed walks with other dogs. Stay tuned for more information as Sapphire is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sapphire please fill out an Application at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He eats extremely quickly and will steal (attempt to anyway) other dogs food if he is left unattended. If watched he sits and waits then cleans all the bowls. He will chase a cat if it runs away. If it doesn't he's friends with them inside as well as outside. He must have a well secured, fenced yard. He is a lover and in no way a fighter. He wants to be the first dog out the door - working on that one too.",

            "description": "Tex needs a savvy owner as he hasn't had the best life before us. He can be a little intimidating when he feels threatened or scared. Other than that, he is a great house dog and other than defluffing a stuffed animal, never makes a mess.\n\nHe is potty trained and kennels nicely, but doesn't need to be. He does best with calm, confident dogs. He doesn't care for children at all as they are a little scary to him, especially ones who aren't taught manners.\n\nHe suffered a severe leg injury that required several surgeries, so even though he is active, he will never be able to go on long runs due to pain from the past injury.\n\nTex was found laying in a drainage ditch in Texas for several days, unable to get up. This is a death sentence for most dogs in Texas, but a kind vet decided to help him free of charge. She felt he would be a great dog one day, if someone would just put some effort into him. She\n\npinned his leg back in place, but somehow, the pin ended up working its way out, sticking up painfully through the skin.\n\nHe was then rushed into surgery to remove the pin, which then had become infused into the bone, making it quite time consuming to surgically remove it.\n\nOnce he was healed from his surgeries and heart worms, he was finally able to get busy living. But he still has so much more he'd like to do in this life, and wants someone to love to do those things with.\n\nIf you are someone who is dog savvy and able to handle temper tantrums from him without anger, someone who is able to read dogs well, and someone who is somewhat active, as he loves adventures, he might be the dog for you.\n\nTex does have one little bad habit, when he's throwing a temper tantrum, he likes to grab your feet to move you where he wants you to go. His foster mom has learned to not cave in to his toddler tantrums, and to redirect his focus on something positive. His adopter will have to learn this technique in order for it to be a successful adoption.\n\nTex is estimated to be 5 yrs old and is 60 lbs. His adoption fee is $250.00. Please fill out the adoption application if you are interested in meeting Tex so that we may see if it's a good fit. 2/2/21 4:05 PM",

            "description": "Kiley aka Thumper has arrived. She is estimated to be  18 month (as of Sept. 2020)  Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Super sweet and playful. Thumper was found in March and no one claimed her. Thumper is great with children. LOVES to ride in the car too. KILEY is ok with dogs with a few exceptions.  Kiley is TERRIFIED of pools. This darling is ready to come home with you today! Won't you please adopt this loving baby and make room in rescue for us to save another life?\n\nFor more information or to adopt this special pet, call Donna at 305-596-9694 or text . (Please leave your phone number to get a call back). Email at: fairytailsorg@gmail.com. All pets in our care are given a full veterinary exam before adoption. They are vaccinated, spayed/neutered, and given dental and grooming services as needed. Cats are tested for Feline Leukemia, and dogs are tested for Heartworms. Donations are very critical to our existence -- they help us to continue rescuing these pets and to make sure that they are healthy and properly socialized before being adopted.< Thank you for considering a Fairy Tails animal.",

She was adopted only a month before from a rescue in Tennessee which did not respond to our inquiries regarding her previous history. Coco is a SWEET girl! She is currently in a foster home with a Chihuahua and several cats and does well with all. She enjoys her walks as much as she enjoys her couch time. Coco is a beautiful red brindle! She is 110% housebroken. Great with meeting new people! Coco is on Keppra to control her seizures. She has had a couple of clusters since arriving in her foster home and we are working on fine tuning her meds. Coco will need more frequent vet visits than the average dog her age. With excellent care, we feel she can live a relatively normal life and will make an excellent companion for some lucky family. Coco has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm tested. Adoption $200. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org if you are interested in adding Coco to your family!",

She would do well in a home were she can shine as your only pet and soak up all the attention. Juju is very affectionate with people, burying her head in your lap, legs shoulder or wherever she can snuggle up close to. She has done well with meeting kids aged 4 and above, she is very gentle or either pays them no mind. Juju loves to play and will quickly win you over with her fun personality. She is a great companion who absolutely loves to be with her people with whatever you decide to do. A girl ready to reward you with her undying devotion, send in your adoption application today at www.underhoundrailroad.org.\n\nJuju is currently being fostered in North Carolina and can transport North to her furever home.

He never got close enough to a human, always too afraid to make a connection. \n\nA woman contacted us about him, we came to her side immediately and was able catch him in a trap from animal control. He was very scared and timid upon seeing and being near humans, but since he has been in our care and around other dogs he has learned to trust us some.\n\nPeanut opens up more when another dog is around; he feels comfortable and more confident when other dogs are present! We believe Peanut would reach his full potential and grow more with another dog in the home environment. With that being said, we ask that anyone inquiring have a fur-baby already at home!\n\nPlease give this cute little guy a chance when looking for your next companion and family member!",

He is a bit of a wild man when greeting new friends so could use a training class to better his obedience and polite greetings.

Luke is treat motivated so is eager to make friends if food is involved!  Luke is crate trained, house trained and has nice manners.  He has some obedience training under his belt as well.  Luke is good off leash and loves to hike and run.  He is quite an athlete!  Breed experience requested.  \n\nAdoption fee: $300\nWeight: 80 lbs.\nD.O.B 9/18",

            "description": "***Zanna is only available through our Foster to Adopt Program***\n \nHi, I'm Zanna. I'm cuddling with my foster mom right now and she says she's had about fifteen other foster dogs and I'm by far the sweetest and easiest foster she's ever had. She wants to tell you why I'm so amazing so I can find my forever family.\n\nShe says I'm really easy going and low maintenance. I never have any accidents in the house, only need to be let out a few times a day, sleep all night without a peep in my kennel, don't chew anything but my own toys, and I'm playful but not needy or pushy. \n\nI get along great with people and dogs. Right now I live with my mom and a seven year old and ten year old kid. \n There was another foster dog here when I first arrived and we played together all day. I miss her a lot. I've also had playdates with other dogs and it makes me so happy to play with them. My foster mom says she'd keep me forever except the resident dog that lives here doesn't like other dogs. She tells me not to take it personally because the other dog hasn't liked any of the foster dogs that lived here either. My mom wants me to find a home with another dog that I can play with and cuddle with all day. That's her one hope for me and why she knows she can't keep me.\n \nI do a lot of cute things that make my mom smile. I love throwing pine cones around the yard to myself and burying them in the snow and then pouncing on them and digging them up and throwing them again. I wait by the window when my mom leaves and watch for her to come home. I'm so happy when my mom gets home and I make her feel really special. I love having my shoulders scratched and massaged and I slowly collapse with happiness when anyone does that. I have the most expressive eyes, which is why my foster mom fell in love with my picture and wanted me to come to Minnesota.\n \nThere's a family out there with another dog who is looking for a playmate and that's where I'm meant to be. Could that be with you?\n\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nZanna just completed Heartworm treatment and is waiting for a negative test result which can take 2-9 months after treatment. During these months, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Zanna is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The committment will be for an adoption but will be fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. \n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF APPS/INQUIRED WE RECEIVE, WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO APPS/INQUIRES THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THIS DOG. Thank you! \n\nMeet Bronson!\n\nBronson is roughly 2 years old and absolutely loves getting attention from humans. He's good around other dogs and spends time at a doggie daycare getting his exercise on. He is crate trained and house broken. He spends his off-days being totally lazy either taking naps with his foster dad or laying out on the porch. Bronson has a tendency to chase moving small creatures, but isn't harmful. He also gets very nervous around vacuum cleaners, but he's getting better every day!\n\nBronson is neutered, current on vaccines and microchipped.\n\nAdoption fee is $200.00. \n\nAdoption application & home visit required.  Bronson requires a fenced in yard. (No invisible fence) Must live within 30 miles of Cleveland. If interested Bronson fill out an app on our website www.muttsinarutrescue.com",

He came to the shelter as a stray and sadly no one came looking for him.  He was becoming increasingly stressed at the shelter, but we were finally able to pull him and now he spends his days with a loving foster family until he finds his forever home.  His foster family is still getting to know him, but he has settled in quite nicely.\n\nJamie looks like a muscly macho man, but enjoys nothing more than chest scratches and snacks!  His manners are really good with all the training that he has received and would most benefit from a dog-savvy family who can help him to continue becoming the polite gentleman he was destined to be!  He has walked nicely alongside other dogs and based on input from his foster, we believe that he can be with other dogs in the home environment if properly introduced.  Check out this handsome stud in action: https://youtu.be/21WyrEM9Kgk! \n\nPlease help us get Jamie into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt our loving dog Jamie, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

He was surrendered by his former owner along with another dog, Thanos, after she moved from Texas and could no longer provide adequate care for them in her new living situation. Hulk loves people and loves to play with Thanos but other than Thanos, we believe Hulk needs to go to a home with only a female dog and no males. Although he more than tolerates his house mate Thanos, his patience can wear thin some times. Through the fence he tries to play with Connor, a puppy we have at our rescue, but he seems to feel challenged by an adult male. Therefore, Hulk is a real \"ladies man\" and we feel if he goes to a home with another dog, it must be a female and they will need a couple of meetings before finalizing the adoption. \n\nHulk also has a very affectionate side and really enjoys running in our fields! He is house trained, knows how to sit and is eager to please. This guy just wants someone to give him the love and attention he deserves and is yearning for.",

Matty will give back in affection and trust more than you can give him.He is healthy, heartworm negative and fully vetted. Matty needs someone at home since he has separation anxiety or if you are gone short periods he needs to be cozy in a crate. He would love to have a dog companion for playing and comfort.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nUPDATE 12/21/2020\n\nAt his last vet check in November, Paddington was released by the vet to have more activity to help strengthen the muscles in his legs. We give him Carprofen and a glucosamine supplement daily, and now, instead of being limited to going into a small courtyard for play, Paddington is allowed to go into the main yard, where he enjoys playing with other dogs. As much as he enjoys playtime, Paddington still seems to prefer the company of his humans, but we think it will be important for him to have another dog in the home who is willing to play some. Paddington seems to be very smart about knowing his limits -- we notice that he plays with dogs who are in the 2-4 year age range, rather than with those who are not yet a year old.\n\nPaddington definitely still enjoys all the chewing habits of a puppy, and he delights in destroying every new stuffie we give him, and even sometimes thinks dog beds are good for chewing on. Thankfully, he hasn't seemed inclined to chew on our furniture, and we keep our shoes, TV remote, and other temptations out of reach. He's very good about going into the crate at night when we say it's bedtime, though he definitely expects a treat every time.\n\nIn spite of having increased activity during the past month, we haven't noticed Paddington limping or showing any signs of pain, so we're hopeful that he is growing out of his bone issues, which are described in more detail in his original bio below.\n\nORIGINAL BIO\n\nPaddington is a young boy in need of a medical foster or a committed adopter. Paddington has not just one but TWO bone-related problems -- Panosteitis and Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD). Panosteitis involves inflammation of the long bones of the legs, and is often called growing pains. Thankfully, pups usually grow out of this problem as they develop and mature. Treatment is basically just good food and pain management. HOD also involves inflammation of the front leg bones, just a different area. Again, treatment involves good food and pain management, plus plenty of rest, with restricted activity. We hope Paddington will grow out of this condition as well, but the vet warned us that there are no guarantees.\n\nPaddington needs a nice quiet home where he can enjoy life without wanting to get rambunctious and play with another puppy or young dog. He gets along well with other animals, so if you have a nice calm adult dog (this sounds like most Pyrs, right?) who has no interest in playing with a pup, Paddington could be an easy addition to your home.\n\nIf you can foster, or if you are interested in making Paddington a permanent member of your family, please send an e-mail to BARN@lonestarmail.net, or complete the application on our website:\nhttps://www.bluebonnetrescue.org/info/adoption\n. This sweet young boy deserves the best care we can provide, and we hope you will help us do exactly that.",

I am super food motivated and I am a fast learner!  I know how to sit and I walk fairly well on a leash too!

Once safe with Cool Cats we worked hard to find the pups homes and get focused on this neglected momma. Skye has been on her own for most her short life and has learned life can be rough, but isn't going to let that define her. After almost a month living in home with a trainer for confidence camp we are so happy to say she is ready to find her Fur-Ever home. Skye does come with some follow up training to help everyone get adjusted. She will require a patient loving owner and having another polite dog would be a plus. Skye has lived with a pack of big and little dogs since her arrival and it has helped her see what being a dog is all about. Once she is comfy and knows you are her person she is part clown and is all about play time and getting snuggles. If you would like to learn more about Skye please send a message. Located in Cave Creek, AZ.\nAdoption fee is $350 and includes Spay, Microchip, Fully Vaccinated and even a Bonnie's Barkery Adoption Pack ( to be picked up by adopter at Bonnie's Cave Creek Location w/Proof of adoption)!",

He walks great on a leash and would be a wonderful walking/jogging partner. Grant is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and tested positive for heartworm disease.  We are in the process of treating his heartworms but he can be adopted during the time as long as the treatment is continued.  PACC will cover the cost of his heartworm treatment.\n\nHe is a special needs pup because he has bad vision.  He has cataracts forming in his eyes so his vision is limited but it does not slow him down.\n\nAdoption fee is $150.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Grant, please submit an adoption application at www.pacconline.org.  This does NOT obligate you to adopt. \n\nIf you want to send Grant and items while he is in foster care, please check out his Amazon wish list https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/CLP4R4I98ZXH?ref_=wl_share",

            "description": "Hello bulldog lovers I\u2019m Stormy!\nI am a 4.5 year old male bulldog who came into CEBR\u2019s care as an owner surrender. My house had a lot of medical professionals that would have to visit on a regular basis to check on my family and it became very stressful for me. I\u2019m definitely a big boy as I weighed in at 97 pounds at my first vet visit. I have completely revamped my diet and am working on becoming more svelte and would expect my forever family to continue to help me reach my goal weight. I also have a curly tail which is hard to clean. I have an appointment to have it amputated so I can live comfortably again without all this irritation on my behind that can make me ornery.\nI really like to be around my people and don\u2019t always like being separated but calm down after a bit of complaining. Given I am a big boy I like to be around my family I have no problem trying to push open doors with my nose and will likely follow you around. I do have a foster sister right now and 95% of the time we ignore each other. Sometimes when we go out I try to show her who is boss, so I can use some work on my manners.\nI know when its time for me to eat and I\u2019m on a special diet. I don\u2019t get to vocal about it and like my new food and that is when I also take my medicines. As far as treats, I like cucumbers, carrots and on special occasions chicken/carrot treats! I have folds on my face that need cleaning as well, so probably best that someone who has done this before adopts me.\nSo to sum it up, my ideal home would be with a parent that can help me with my manners when around other dogs and people. I like to go outside and for car rides because I don\u2019t like to miss out on action. I don\u2019t really care about toys\u2026it\u2019s all about the attention that I can get from my forever family!\nAs soon as I\u2019m fully healthy I\u2019m looking forward to meeting my permanent home.\n\nIf you would like to donate to Stormy's care, please go to our website at http://shopcebr.com/products/donation.\n\nHOW TO QUALIFY FOR A CEBR BULLY To determine if you qualify to adopt one of our adorable bullies start by viewing our Adoption Area Map.

We aren't sure of her exposure to cats as she has never been around them while in our care, but she would likely do well co-existing with a kitty friend. Bailey does well with other dogs with proper and slow introductions. She would love a dog experienced home that will work with her, or to be someone's one and only girl. \n\nTo adopt Bailey, please click below for an adoption application\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/TGD/Dog",

He has been know to chase cats and is extremely selective with dogs as he always wants to play a very dominant role, so Tech needs a home where is the only pet. We also recommend that children in the home should be over the age of 13.Please visit the following link on our website to learn about Second Chance's adoption process. http://www.2ndchanceanimalcenter.org/adoption.html",

He had been adopted and was in a home for quite some time, but unfortunately he was returned to the shelter when his previous owners no longer had the means to care for him. He is quite the energetic boy and loves running around a fenced-in yard, playing tug-of-war, and just exploring the local trails.\nCaspian does not do well with other dogs but could live with a dog-savvy cat. He would need to live with children over the age of 13 due to his reactions to certain situations. He is a fun-loving dog who has had a hard first few years of life and deserves to be stable and happy!Please visit the following link on our website to learn about Second Chance's adoption process. http://www.2ndchanceanimalcenter.org/adoption.html\n\n1/30/21 4:20 PM",

GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $200. THESE FEES HELP KEEP THE RESCUE GOING. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

This sweet, female pit bull mix dog certainly did not deserve this treatment. She is one of the friendliest, most gentle big dogs ever to come to AALOC. \n\nRuby is a medium-sized dog, about 50 pounds. She\u2019s has a beautiful all white coat, black and white polka dot ears, chocolate brown eyes and a black button nose. She likes attention, to play in the yard and would make a great cuddle buddy. She has shorthair and she is housebroken. We believe she would make a good companion for a dog of similar size.\n\nRuby is in a foster home for the cold winter months. The foster parents have sent the following report: \u201cRuby is gentle and loving and completely housebroken. She is a bit of a picky eater, unless of course you\u2019re giving her chicken treats. She likes to be warm and loves to go out for walks or spend time in our small yard. She spotted a squirrel on the fence one day and now every time she is in the yard she looks for that squirrel. She already knows the \u201csit\u201d command and to give her paw and we are focused on teaching her not to pull when she is on a walk. Ruby is really just one big love bug!\u201d\n\nPlease submit an application to adopt Ruby on our website at www.AALOC.org. Once your application is reviewed and approved we will contact you to make an appointment to visit us at AALOC to meet Ruby during visiting hours (10am to 3pm daily) and get to know her a bit.\n\nDonation of $165 for dog adoption includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, and a microchip. Applications require a veterinary reference and home visit (in Orange County, CA). For more information on adoption policies visit our homepage at www.aaloc.org. Contact us by e-mail: aaloc@aaloc.org, or by phone (714)893-4393.",

You might remember me...I'm Gomer, a former long time resident of Animal Ark. I'm an 11 year old, male Bulldog/Shar Pei mix. I had finally found my wonderful family when Covid 19 caused changes in their living situation, and mine. I'm back at the Shelter and we're all very sad about it. I have a \"quirky\" personality but in the right home I will thrive and give you tons of love. I can not live with cats and do better with female dogs than male. I lived with kids ages 4 to 13 and did well with them. I know many commands like sit, stay, kennel up and lay down, and I'm housebroken, too! It's great to see my favorite volunteers and staff again but it would be really super great to have a home once again. Ask the staff about a foster or foster to adopt situation for me.",

            "description": "FRANNY is great with people. Once she decides she can trust you she is ALL IN and very loving. When it comes to doggy friends, Franny prefers to be the boss. No cats for Miss Franny. Franny may be one of our older dogs, but her energy level proves that age is just a number. Her absolute FAVORITE thing to do is take her daily walk. She goes for 1-2 miles every day. Franny's foster mom feels it is very important that her forever home is one that will keep up with her daily walk routine as it is vital to her happiness. You will surely be the talk of the neighborhood taking this 90lb beauty for walks! Due to her size and playfulness, Franny would do best in a home with older children. A close second place to the daily walk on Franny's favorite things list are eat scratchies and treats. These should be administered daily as well.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org.

            "description": "Hello, my name is Mama Didi. I am a long timer with Dallas Dog RRR. I am a lab mix, about 40 pounds and approximately 4 years old. I was rescued in South Dallas from a drain pipe, along with my babies. Mama Didi did an awesome job keeping her little family together and safe. Her puppies have long since been adopted and Mama Didi has been with a special foster ever since, waiting for the perfect forever.\n\nMama Didi will need a patient, special adopter. It is clear she has suffered some sort of trauma in her past. She is very sweet and dog friendly but needs an adopter who will understand that Mama Didi is happiest within her own comfort zone. She loves people but is not the type of girl to jump up on the couch and snuggle. Being put on a leash is a stressor for her but Didi will happily chill in the backyard. Bringing Mama Didi into your family will take some work and most likely several meets beforehand, but once she becomes comfortable you will be awarded with the love and presence of a very happy girl. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nArchie\n\nIf you love Both the energy and spunk of the Jack Russell and the loyalty Of the Pug, this boy has both in spades. Archie was rescued from a rural shelter in California that has almost no foot traffic and depends on rescues to save the dogs. Archie was out of time and this little cutie just sashayed out to the greeting room, tail wagging knowing he was about to be set free.\n\nArchie is a curious, intelligent, gentle, super muscular, yet playful and full of life little guy. We have not tested him with cats so we recommend a cat-free home. Archie does well with Dog savvy children and Archie seems to love female dogs but is very particular about which males to pal with. Archie had been previously adopted but his little girl has developed a bad allergy to dogs and he is back in our rescue. Archie is a very high energy dog in terms of exercise. He is currently walking 2-3 miles a day. A yard and a doggie companion to run and play with will help burn off excess energy along with his daily walks.\nIf you do not walk you current dog(s), please do not apply for Archie, he needs active adopters. He also needs a doggie playmate.\nARCHIE cannot be an only dog\n(we keep receiving applications from people without a dog buddy for Archie)\n\nArchie has a $650.00 adoption fee which covers neuter, microchip, updating of his vaccines, flea control, and his general health care. All Monies are recycled to save more dogs.\n\nArchie is eating a species-specific diet of Raw and Human grade dog food. We educate our adopters in Canine Nutrition. He must be kept on this high grade food for his health and longevity. Archie came to us with severe allergies from eating poor quality food and his health has improved immeasurable. Anything less than Human grade will send his health spiraling backwards so his adopters need to be committed to species specific human grade food.\n\nTo fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.\n\n2/2/21 5:51 PM",

This is not an apartment dog.\nBullet has loads of energy and will need daily walking and benefit from a trainer. \nPlease consider giving Bullet a home of his own.\n\nOur adoption fee for local adoptions within Texas is $250.00 and our adoption fee for our NJ and East Bound dogs is $500.00 and includes ground transport.\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered before adoption and are vaccinated for Rabies and DHPP. Are dogs are all microchipped and tested for heartworms.\nPlease contact ddadoptions@gmail.com for an adoption application.\nDue to high call intake at this time please inquire via email for the dog you are interested in and someone will contact you in a timely matter.\nWe appreciate you patience.\n\nDDRR is a volunteer based rescue located in South Texas.\nMost of these dogs are being cared for in a kennel type environment and may have not been tested with children or cats.\nWe do extensive screening with our potential adopters and require that you complete and scan back the application to be considered for adoption.\nWe will review your application and contact you in a timely manner.\nPlease answer ALL the questions and add anything that maybe relevant to help us match you with the right dog for your family.\n",

Scotty knows sit, down, stay, touch, place and shake and he's ready to learn more. He plays well with other dogs and seems especially fond of those smaller than him. Scotty went to playgroup twice a week and it's best to establish early routines with him so he doesn't become too attached to always being at home.\n\nScotty will be protective of his owner and would be best in a one person household. He loves being outside, playing with toys and chewing on bones. He entertains himself by tossing toys into the air and chasing them. He also loves to chase lizards and catch flies.\n\nThis special guy needs a special owner. And now Scotty's adoption fee has been paid for thanks to a generous donation by Amy Kobza, Broker Associate with Realty TEXAS Better Life Team. Interested in meeting Scotty? \n\nContact the Williamson County Regional Animal Shelter to set up an appointment by emailing Steven.McLeroy@Wilco.org.",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nMeet Ziggie is around 6 yrs old, 40 lb Corgi mix. He has had all shots and is heart worm negative. He was found on the streets of Tampa and was so sick from neglect that it took 3 months to help him become healthy. Ziggie is house trained, walks on a leash, knows all commands and loves car rides. He is very laid back, preferring to lay at your feet and follow you around. He's not a cuddle-buddy, but always wants you nearby. He is quiet and doesn't play with toys. He needs a home with no other pets and no children. Ziggy nips when there is something he does not like, such as being picked up, someone touching his tail, or if he is startled. He is aggressive if he has something in his mouth that you don't want him to have. He can be very aggressive with strangers. We have worked for 3 months with him and honestly do not think these are habits that can be changed. He should be approached with caution and a soft voice to allow him to gain more confidence to become a loving boy. He has minimal exercise requirements, short potty walks and a longer walk in the evening. He should always be on a leash.\n\nZiggie's Adoption Fee is $300 - obedience training is required\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups. We understand with what is going on in the world that this may be a bit delayed. Please email us the completion certificate.\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt please fill out application at\n\nwww.heidislegacydogrescue.com/apply-to-foster-or-adopt\n\nThank you for completing the application.

During COVID restrictions, dogs are available to meet potential adopters by appointment.  For more information or directions, please call 717-697-3377.  Leave a message on our adoption line and a volunteer will return your call ASAP.",

I'm a middle of the road type of pup, I enjoy movie nights on the couch as much as I love running marathons.

My last wishes are to spend the rest of my days with someone in a happy and healthy home.All of our dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date with age appropriate vaccinations, heart worm or feleuk/FIV tested, fecal tested, rabies and tag, and microchipped before being placed in your home.

She is an adult dog who requires a low traffic, adults only home due to her being very nervous around new people. Andrea also needs to go home to a single family household with a fully fenced in backyard. Andrea enjoys being the center of attention so she cannot go home to other pets. To ensure a perfect match, Andrea needs to meet everyone in the household before going home.",

Vet examination shows is no visual reaction to light stimulus, his lenses are at a strange angle. Suspect trauma since he did have some road rash. Stevie has gained weight, all vaccines have been updated, neutered, microchipped and he has completed his treatment for his heartworms. Stevie is doing well on his house and leash trained, He also knows the commands, sit, stay, and down. Stevie needs a home with not cats as he thinks they are toys that are to played with when they hiss or swat him. He would do best in a quiet home as he is still easily startled, so no small children And he will need someone patient to help him learn / map his new home.",

He will require an experienced firm, strong handler and a home with no other animals for now. He would be a great companion for someone with training/behavior experienced who is also active. Due to Tiegan's size and energy he is not suitable for apartment living, a home with space for him to run and play is most ideal. A home with young children is not ideal.\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed. An application, home check, contract and adoption fee are required for all adoptions. All dogs will be, or required to be, spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped before adoption. Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them. We do not have cats or other small animals, we cannot say with any certainty how any of our dogs would co-exist with other animals unless they are from homes previously with other animals.\nAdoption fees vary between $350 - $450 for puppies 8 weeks - 4 years, $300 5 - 8 years and $250 for dogs over 8 years. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip a wellness check, any additional medical expenses necessary and of course the all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\nFor additional information or questions, please email us at info@muttmatchla.org. To submit an application, please visit us at www.muttmatchla.org. Mutt Match L.A. is an all volunteer rescue, please allow at least 48 hours for a returned response of all inquires.\n\nThank you!

We were able to save Malia out of a severe hoarding situation where she had been kept in a stack of crates in a warehouse. We are so happy that now we can finally show Malia what the good life is like! She had gotten all the medical care she needs with our vet partner and now it is time for her to find the most wonderful and loving forever home. We can't wait to see this beautiful and happy girl finally adored and loved unconditionally! Despite what Malia has endured, she is so very sweet and playful. She has the cutest speckled \"socks.\" We don't know what happened to Malia to cause this, but she is fearful of men and would do best in a female household (no apartments) with someone home more often than not. Any children in the home should be older, and it would be best if there are no cats in the home. She will be spayed and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in her forever home. If you can open your heart and home to Malia, please fill out an adoption application for Malia here! www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

I love being a part of the family, belly rubs, hugs, treat-filled Kongs, sitting in the sun, and walks. My foster mom thinks I'm so sweet and will bring great joy to a family.\nI'm excellent with people (even ones I've never met). I have good indoor manners and use the doggy door well. I\u2019ve learned to \u201csit,\u201d and I\u2019m working hard on \u201cstay.\u201d I don\u2019t jump on people or bark. Every now and then, I let out a howl which makes my foster mom laugh. I will follow you around the house or rest at your feet because I want to be wherever you are.\nI'm getting used to being on the leash. (My foster mom says I do much better with the EasyWalk harness.) I would really appreciate getting to live with a human that can help me learn to contain my excitement when I see other dogs or cats. (Ever since I\u2019ve been with my foster mom, I\u2019ve been limited in play time. I had a broken leg, which has now healed! Then, I have been on movement restriction because of heartworm treatment. So I can\u2019t wait until I can play with other dogs!)\nI am up to date on my shots, microchipped, and I can be neutered (not sure what that is!) sometime in February.\nDo you have a place for me in your home and your heart?\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

At 10 years old, I have decided to retire from the superheroine life and finally live the forever home life.  As a superheroine, I was never concerned with the crate training business, but I am learning all about it now while I am waiting to find you. One of my greatest superpowers is my intelligence, so I will have all of that down soon. I have already mastered the house training stuff.   Now that I have put all of my villain fighting in the past, I am pretty laid back.  With all of my adventures behind me, I have no particular preference where my forever home is whether that be a house, apartment or on the road in a big rig.  I am a friendly girl and would do well with other dogs and kids, but cats are perhaps my greatest nemesis.  So, no cats, please.  While I will miss the life of fighting bad guys and keeping the world safe, my greatest adventure is still out there.  All they have to do is fill out an application for me, Shera.\n\nMy adoption fee is $75 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "2/2/2021\nBryson is a 3-4 year old bluetick coonhound / treeing walker coonhound mix. He has beautiful markings. He weighs about 50-55 lbs and is a neutered male. He is up to date on vaccinations and is neutered. He is heartworm negative. He is good with other dogs and very playful. He is social and friendly w people. He likes to snuggle. Bryson is unaware of his size and likes kids but would do best with older sturdy children due to his size and bouncy behavior (no small children or toddlers he could knock over). He is crate trained, housebroken in his current foster home, and has good house manners. He likes to be petted and is very treat motivated. He walkes decent on leash but walks best w a harness because he pulls when he is interested in something. A secure fenced yard is recommended for him. \n\nHe likes to sniff and explore the yard, checking for squirels. He likes tug toys and rope toys to play w the other dogs. He also likes tennis balls to chew but he doesnt fetch them for you. He is easily distracted by scents in the yard. He would do best with someone with a secure fenced-in yard or someone with a very active lifestyle (hiking, running, jogging, etc). He needs daily exercise and is an active dog. He would probably do best with someone with another dog for him to play and wrestle with to help satisfy his exercise needs.\n\nHe would do fine w medium to larger dogs. Small dogs he would trample because he doesnt understand his size and he is a little clumsy. We recommend no doggie friends under 20lbs for Bryson. He cannot live w cats or small animals or birds due to his natural prey drive. He would do best with another active dog to play with at home. \n\nApplications can be found at www.wagsrescue.com\n\n\n12/2/2020\nBryson is a happy and playful guy. He is about 45-50 lbs. Male / Neutered. He is good w other dogs and is currently living with several other hounds. He is social and friendly with people. He likes to be petted and is very treat motivated. He knows commands like sit and come. He likes to sniff and explore the yard, checking for squirels. He likes tug toys and rope toys to play w the other dogs. He also likes tennis balls to chew but he doesnt fetch them for you. He is easily distracted by scents in the yard. He would do best with someone with a secure fenced in yard or someone with a very active lifestyle (hiking, running, jogging, etc). He needs daily exercise and is an active dog. He would probably do best with someone with another dog for him to play and wrestle with to help satisfy his exercise needs.\n\nHe is crate trained and housebroken in his current foster home. He is always happy and always doing something goofy. He would do fine w medium to larger dogs. Small dogs he would trample because he doesnt understand his size and he is a little clumsy. We recommend no doggie friends under 20lbs for Bryson. He cannot live w cats or small animals or birds due to his natural prey drive. He would do best with another dog to play with at home. \n\nIn the past 3 months that Bryson has been living in foster care he has improved with his house manners and adjusted to living inside. He still needs occassional reminders not to check out the counter top or sniff the trash can. He walks best on harness. He has a tendency to pull towards scents and things that are interesting. He likes to go places and he likes car rides. \nBest thing about him: he will make you laugh every day because he is such a goofball. \n\nBryson is hoping to hear from you. Applications can be found at www.wagsrescue.com or reach out to your application processor for contact info for Brysons foster home. \n\n9/30/2020\nBryson will be arriving to the Pa area the weekend of October 3rd. She will be eligible to meet w preapproved candidates after that date. Applications can be found at Www.wagsrescue.com \n\n\n9/10/2020\nBryson Society\n\nMeet Bryson Society. He is a fun and goofy Hound Mix (Blue tick / treeing walker mix). He is about 3-4 years old. He is a neutered male. He is heartworm negative and currently residing in a foster home in North Carolina. He is hoping to make his way to PA soon. Bryson has markings that resemble a treeing walker coonhound as well as a bluetick coonhound but its hard to say exactly what he is. He may even have some beagle in him. We will just call him an adorable hound mix for now. \n\nBryson has been good with other dogs but due to his prey drive we are saying no small dogs / no small fast dogs.. He is too excited by cats and squirrels so we dont think he would be a good candidate for someone who owns cats or small animals. Bryson is working on not pulling during leash walking and walks better with a harness. He likes to smell, sniff, and explore. He would love to have a fenced in yard to explore in. He is working on crate training and house manners. He still likes to explore the counters. He is playful, active, and happy. \n\nHe is learning commands and does sit. He is also working on leash skills. He would love a fenced in yard to explore. He would probably like to live with another dog as hounds tend to be pack animals. \n\nHe will be coming to the PA area soon so we recommend getting pre-approved to adopt by visiting our website and filling out an application. Www.wagsrescue.com\n\n\n  To begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 if you have questions.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Image growing up in a yard with a human throwing you food over a fence and pouring water in your already dirty water day after day. The human never touched you or the other three dogs in the yard and you lived outside like this summer, winter spring and fall until finally 8 years into your life someone reported your owner to the authorities and they finally came to save you! You found yourself placed in a box separate from the only friends you had ever known. Taken to a noisy shelter, poked, probed, bathed and then stuck in a kennel alone. WOW SCARY right??? Well that was the experience for Max's, his best friend Moose and his 2 other fur buddies. Unfortunately the oldest of the 4 was quite ill and passed away :( The other one was adopted and seems to be doing well. Max's was very shut down until the shelter staff placed him with Moose and then they saw Max's come back to life! We couldn't allow Max's to lose the only friend he has ever had on this earth so we are taking both boys and they will only be adopted as a bonded pair with a contract signed that they will NOT be separated!! Max's & Moose will have to learn to live in a home, walk on a leash and understand what it is like to be valued and actually LOVED by a human. If you would like to be considered for the boys please fill out an adoption application.Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

He is somewhat lacking in leash skills and can be independent, probably due to not having any real people contact and direction.  He loves to chase the ball, will bring it back most of the time, carry his own leash in his mouth, and when tired of playing with a squeaky toy, could easily de-fluff it!  He will need a knowledgeable and experienced owner so his great personality can shine!  He has a lot of potential to make a great family addition.  Bean will benefit from a fenced yard.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

Oreo thrives on attention and affection, and she will let the whole world know it when it is her turn to partake in such pleasures. Oreo has great qualities like taking treats gently and being house-trained. She is described as curious, active, and playful. No surprise! She has been in a playgroup with other male dogs and has done well, though we do recommend a meet and greet with your resident dog to be sure Oreo approves! Oreo also enjoys a ride in the car, fetch, and playing in the water. She would likely do best in an adults-only home. Email adoption@wilco.org to schedule an appointment to meet Oreo.",

They are still learning about people and how to be curious fun puppies. When we adopt them out, they will be separated.\n\nIf you are interested in one of them, you are going to need:\n\nExperience with puppies - they are a little behind on socialization and house training\nA good social dog who can set a good example for them\nA lot of patience\nChildre 12 and Up (experience in handling a stressed-out puppy is good)\nA fenced yard is needed (I haven't tried putting a leash on yet, so I can't say how that will go)\nSomeone who is home most of the day.\n\nPlease be patient in this process. Finding their forever homes is going to take some time.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

Maxx may be a few years younger as when he saw our vet they aged him at about 7 years. He received a dental cleaning but did not require any extractions. Maxx prefers to take his time getting to know people, but is a loving boy once he warms up. His favorite thing to do is snuggle up under some comfy blankies. He has done well with adults that respect his boundaries and go slow with him. Maxx needs a home with no children under the age of 18. He is easily spooked by fast movements and would do best in a quiet environment. Maxx has done well with other dogs here. Please bring any potential canine companions to meet with him prior to adoption. Maxx is kennel trained and walks well on a leash. Maxx will need a patient home willing to take the time to learn his personality and let him come out of his shell at his own pace. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, vet checked and microchipped. His adoption fee of $120 includes a free vet visit. To potentially adopt Rockstar Maxx, please call his foster mom Sandy at 815-993-2018.",

            "description": "Looks like: Poodle Mix\nMale, 9 years old, 18 pounds\nKing Charles is a fairy relaxed dog who absolutely loves going on walks. He is good walker - no pulling or tugging but does like the occasional slow down to 'smell the roses.' He loves the outdoors and does two hour walks with ease. He accepts being touched without any issue or attitude. He likes car rides and looking out the window. Charles sits quietly while you eat and does not beg for food. He does like treats and takes food very gently. \n\nKing Charles is social with humans and dogs of all sizes. He's friendly with lots of tail wagging as he likes to meet new friends. He'd be happiest in an active home, and needs one with another dog. \n\nKing Charles is a total champ with other dogs. He has been around dogs of all ages, sizes, temperaments and he is absolutely excellent. He is even a social butterfly with cats. He does have separation anxiety though, and will whine when left behind. Another dog for company helps alleviate that anxiety and once acclimated to a home it should subside. \n\nHe will benefit with a secure yard that he can have access to, including to sunbathe. He does have diminished hearing. King Charles will need help being shown where to go potty and his person will need patience with him as he learns a new routine. He is currently on medications and a prescription diet to help with incontinence. He means well but he occasionally leaks. He needs someone with patience to see him through that journey. We have found belly bands to be very helpful. \n\nHe came to us from Monterey County Animal Services.",

He can get a little spooked around kids so we recommend an adult household.\n\nFilbert was rescued from Louisiana from an unhappy situation. He's missing his front teeth and one of his ears is a bit chewed.  We don't really know what happened. He had some skin issues and was super skinny when brought in but is filling out both in body and coat, is fully vetted and in good health. He would make someone a super loving, fun dog.",

We are providing a service to Del Norte County Animal Control to help with adoption. Please contact the shelter directly if you are interested in meeting or adopting this dog--their info is below.\n\n\nMeet Charlie! He's a large Yellow Lab type of guy, about 4 years old. He's free spirited and independent. Charlie's favorite things seem to be playing fetch & the water! He was actually found at the river, and although he is micro-chipped, his owner did not come for him. Charlie gets so excited for fetch, he doesn't notice the hand holding the ball, so would likely do best in a home with no small children. Charlie is blind in his right eye, which may affect his depth perception. Although he will sit, he doesn't seem to have had much training or discipline, so would do best with an experienced owner. He's a high energy guy, and \"catch me if you can\" also seems to be a favorite game of his. He needs a home where he can be kept secure. He doesn't care for our other dogs, so may do best as your only buddy. Charlie just loves being a dog. He doesn't seem to care too much about affection, he just wants to run and have fun! If you're looking for a big buddy who is always ready for fun, come out and meet Charlie! \n\n\nBorn Again Pit Bull Rescue (BAPBR) regularly works with the wonderful volunteers at the Del Norte County Animal Control Shelter located out in rural Crescent City, CA (a small coastal town on the OR/CA border). They have a very small shelter with small indoor 3x6 kennel runs, low foot traffic, odd adoption viewing hours and it rains a lot which means the dogs can't always come outside to play--so we want YOU to see some of their really great dogs that they have up for adoption. It's only a short 5-hour drive from Portland to adopt your new family member!\n\n\nDel Norte County Animal Control is located in Crescent City, CA. They are open Monday thru Friday from 8am to 5pm. They are closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAddress: 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531\n\nShelter phone: (707) 464-7235\n\nAdoption fee: $ 75.00\n\nEmail: delnortedogs@gmail.com\n\nFind them on Facebook: www.facebook.com/DNdogs707  \u201cDogs of Del Norte County\u201d",

She's an adult Pit Bull type girl, brought to us by Law Enforcement when her owner was arrested. No one came for her, and Karma is in need of a new home. Karma was quite distraught by her new housing situation, and it took some time for her to allow us to handle her. She's slowly coming out of her shell, and while she is leery of strangers, she is showing us how playful she is! Karma loves her walks, loves to play fetch, and is obsessed with our big jolly ball! Any potential adopters for this pretty girl should be prepared to put in some time and allow her to get used to them before they make a commitment. Although she seems to always be on guard, she would likely relax and show her wonderful self in a loving home environment. She has been pretty non-reactive to most of our other dogs. Karma would do best with an experienced owner.\n\n\nBorn Again Pit Bull Rescue (BAPBR) regularly works with the wonderful volunteers at the Del Norte County Animal Control Shelter located out in rural Crescent City, CA (a small coastal town on the OR/CA border).

Submit an adoption application online at www.moaspets.com/adoptionapp, and our Program Coordinator will set up a meet and greet!**\n\nLilah is a super sweet, confident lady. In a short 15 minute session with RK K9, Lilah was able to pick up on heel, sit, stay, and come! She shows off her agility skills on the MOAS equipment without any fear or hesitation. She's a very intelligent dog who will absolutely flourish in a home with training. She would do best in an active pet household with no dogs or cats, and would be the perfect running partner or hiking buddy!Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

She gets very attached to her person once comfortable but it takes her a little time.  She is potty trained but when startled or super excited will piddle.  She does well on a leash, likes to go for car rides and play in the yard with friends.  She does need a proper introduction to new fur friends but loves to run and play!  She will do well with children that give her the time and space as she needs.  Her kennel is her space and no one elses!  \nIf you would like to meet Sox please visit our website www.shannonfarmz.com and fill out our adoption application or if you have any questions contact us directly.",

He would do best in a ranch type home or with a big backyard with another friendly dog (or two.) BAILEY has some fear issues which he is getting better with and we want to place him with an experienced adopter with NO children. Once BAILEY warms up to his owner he is gold. He is a playful boy, neutered, great on leash and needs a loving home.\n\nTo meet BAILEY please contact Suzanna:  adoptions@startrescue.org\n\n\nVisit our website:  STARTrescue.org",

Sometimes she wears a boot on her foot to protect it from being dragged.  We ahve done water therapy and many other treatments and she has gotten more and more use out of her leg.  Its better for her to have the wonky leg than to amputate.  She gets around well with what she has.

Benny is both blind and deaf but that does not stop him from living his best life!!!  He is looking for a special forever home with humans who understand his uniqueness and cherish him more for it.\n \nBenny is described as a super sweet guy who is low maintenance.  He is housebroken and has no issues having free roam of his home.  He navigates through his environment really well and seems to not let his blindness or hearing impairment limit him.  Benny does enjoy playtime with his humans and is also doing well with walking on a leash.  He has been great with kids (foster family has a child under the age of 2) and also seems fine with other dogs.  Benny does not seem to feel the same way about cats though- although he is not aggressive with them, once he catches the smell of a cat he is not a happy camper.\n \nBenny is a great companion who has figured out his own way to navigate through life and demands very little from his humans.  Benny is ready to find his forever home and to continue living his best life!\n\nIf you think Benny may be the one for you, please go to our website at www.wagstorichesanimalrescue.org and fill out an application to adopt. Please be sure to include a vet reference as regular vet care is important to us for the health of all our adopted dogs. With approval and a $150 Golden Paws adoption donation, he will be ready to accompany you on all of life\u2019s many adventures!  Benny is neutered, microchipped, fecal tested clean of internal parasites and up to date on all his vaccinations, including rabies.\n",

She does wear a collar with but does not like it pulled on.  She is an old girl who just wants to relax with her person.  If she wants attention she will gently paw at you to pay attention to her.  She is so very sweet.  She does not enjoy other dogs or children.  \n\nIf you would like more information on Daisy please visit our website to fill out our adoption application or contact us directly with any questions.",

I am young at heart and still have so much love to give - you wouldn't believe it! I'd like to be the only dog in the home so I can have a relaxing retirement please. Dr. B and her team here at HCH made sure to run some bloodwork and take some xrays so that I get started on the right path in my new home. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and some of my liver enzymes are elevated. Due to some of my medical concerns and age, HCH is calling me a hospice adoption, which means I may need some extra vet visits in the future. The vet team can tell you all about that when you come to visit. I have the sweetest personality and I love to give my attention to anyone and everyone!\n\nI'm with a foster family, so if you'd like to meet me, contact them at (650) 515-2182 or mplazar2@gmail.com.\n\n*Betty's adoption fee was paid by a generous sponsor! Adoption Fee $0!*\n\nA very generous donor has offered to sponsor a whole YEAR of my medications and food!\nBonus Perks of Adopting a Foster Dog:\n- Extra time spent working on potty training!\n- Insider info, like how I do being home alone and what I'm like at night!\n- Extra training time given to house manners, like greeting visitors!\n- My foster can give you tips on all my favorite things and least favorite things!",

            "description": "Meathead is ready!  Well, as ready as a 7-8 year old guy can be\u2026.it\u2019s hard to guess at what his life was before he came to us as a stray.  Although he was well fed, when he arrived at the pound he was broken.  Afraid.  Uncertain.  Abandoned and he knew it.   It took weeks for him to allow us to touch him.  He liked the ladies first, but then came to be the bumbling goofball he is with everyone.  His trainers think Meathead is a crazy name and they\u2019ve taken to calling him Meatball and Meatloaf.  But you get to name him anything you want because he doesn\u2019t respond to any of them!  A good day for Meathead is as follows:  breakfast, nap, outside, kong, nap, outside, dinner, sleep.  My kind of schedule!  He hates the heat but perks up when the cooler weather prevails and will play outside with his toys, but he doesn\u2019t like to stay outside alone.  No worries, his jaunts are short.  He walks well with a halti harness and will lay down in protest when it\u2019s hot, so short walks are best.  Meathead seems to be crate trained and would do best crated when no one is home because his favorite past times are counter surfing, garbage picking and destuffing items.  He\u2019s been good with dog savvy cats, other mellow dogs and even ignores the roosters currently living in a nearby kennel.  He\u2019s very food motivated and will sit for food immediately, and runs to his kennel when he knows it\u2019s serving time.  Meathead needs someone with large dog/bully breed experience as he\u2019s big and clumsy, stubborn and loud at times.  He\u2019s not a snuggler but sits at my feet when he wants petting.  He has been my best companion throughout the pandemic and needs someone who can provide routine and structure and set limits.  No little kids for this guy, he still jumps when he gets excited and he\u2019s more athletic than he looks.  So all you sturdy candidates out there who want to save a shelter dog, now\u2019s the time, get in line!  For more info please contact Glastonbury CT Animal Control at 860-633-7227.",

He needed extensive dental work, but has no problems eating or playing.\n\nMuttson sometimes nips out of fear, but this is not dangerous.

So I am very used to living in a home! I am a very sweet girl, but I can be uncomfortable meeting new people, so I need slow introductions (with lots of treats!). Once you earn my trust, I will adopt you into my large extended family. I have a lot of family here at the Adoption Center. I love the humans that care for me and spoil me rotten. I have met so many dogs and made so many friends. I often teach the new dogs the rules of the yard and help them feel comfortable here.\n\nMy ideal home would be with adults who live in a calm and quiet home without a lot of commotion. I just need someone who is willing to take the time with me to help me overcome my fear of strangers. Do you think this could be you? I promise I have a lot of love to give! I have been such a patient girl, but I am ready to find my forever home! \n\nI am a part of the Go Fetch Program! My adoption fee is waived and I come with free bonus items! Please reach out to make a special VIP appointment during the week to come meet me!\n\nIncludes spay/neuter and microchip. If the animal you are adopting is not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to sign a contract legally obligating you to have the animal altered. Please contact your HT rep to learn about exclusive low-cost spay/neuter options made available only to HT adopters!\n\nEvery adopted Homeward Trails animal comes with 30 days of free pet health insurance. We are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program/",

            "description": "This gorgeous girl is Lucy \u2013 young and already a big pretty girl. Lucy did not have a great start in life but we are determined to change that and find her a great home of her own. Lucy is sweet and loves people and she is good on leash and does well with other dogs. She likes to play hard with her dog pals in the play yard and then curl up for a nap afterwards. She does best playing with dogs that match her level of play so she would do great with another male dog as a companion or she should do fine on her own with a dedicated owner. She is a typical female Pyrenees who will do best in a home that knows the breed. Lucy came in from a very neglectful situation where she was never taken to a vet and never got fed enough, so she resource guards with food around other dogs and needs to be fed separately. We are working on hand feeding her and making sure she always has enough to eat - something new to Lucy, so she will learn she will never go hungry again. Despite her rough start, Lucy has so much potential. She is smart and learns quickly. She walks great on leash and does great meeting other dogs and playing with them. She may be a bit too playful for a senior dog but does great with younger dogs that she has met. Due to her food aggression we are looking to re-home her to a family without children although she previously lived with kids. She may be grumbly around her food bowl until she knows she will never go hungry again. She seemed fine meeting a cat in boarding but she has never lived with one so we are unsure how she will do with kitties. Lucy was one of those dogs who was stuck out in her owners back yard and largely ignored. Unfortunately she did not even get fed regularly. Lucy is continuing to blossom now that she is getting care and attention and great meals. We are all thankful she is safe in rescue now and look forward to finding her a great family who will continue to work with her. She is still young and still growing and is a beautiful Pyrenees girl with so much potential. Lucy is coming around so well and will be a great dog for some lucky owner!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 9/4/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Lovingly surrendered by owners\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Ida had her ears cleaned and a dental polishing on 9/15/20. She will be ready for adoption on 9/19/20. Please note that Ida does shed lightly. She is not hypoallergenic. Ida requires a home with at least 2 acres of land, where the home is set back far away from the road. She will not be adopted to a first time dog owner.\nWeight: 79.2 lb\nHeight: 30 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $499\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Ida needs a home in a rural area where there are not dogs walking by every day. She has tried living in suburbia and it just didn't work for her. Ida's forever home must be on a minimum of 2 acres of private land, with the home set back away from the road on the property.\n\nIda would love to live with another large dog or dogs that will be active companions. Ida will not be placed in a home with children under 10. She will not be placed in a home with small dogs or cats. She will not be placed with first time dog owners.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Ida is a bit of a tale of two dogs. On one side, Ida is an anxious dog. She was surrendered to Carolina Poodle Rescue due to her inability to live in an urban area. Ida has always barked at dogs living in the neighborhood. She has gone to training, but still barks and growls at strange dogs when on a leash in public settings. The last straw was when she got out of her home and attacked a neighbor's dog that was out for a walk. On the other side, at home Ida, is a different dog. She has lived happily in a home with other dogs. She attended doggie daycare and enjoyed the other dogs and was a good companion.\n\nIda is a big girl with a heart as big as her body. She has a LOT of energy and needs a LOT of exercise. She was halter trained in her previous home and when she is on the halter she does not pull. Given Ida's size and energy level, her new home will be well served to continue halter training with her. Ida would be great as a running or hiking partner. She does well with other dogs in certain settings and would be happy living with another high energy dog.\n\nWhat Ida really needs is land.... lots of fenced land to run and walk and hike. Urban community living is not for this girl. Ida needs continued training on manners, especially on jumping up when she meets people. She has a generally nervous demeanor so a home with less foot traffic will be better for this girl.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Ida's birthday is 2/11/2015\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "We are looking for an experienced foster/adopter for Luna. Although she is sweet and beautiful to look at, she needs some time to gain trust. She is shy and stand-offish at first and needs a foster who understands fearful dogs and has both the patience and knowledge to work with Luna. One of our directors says 'once you have gained her respect and trust she is your best friend and glued to your side'. She's a bouncy ball of fluff.\n\nShe LOVES other dogs and would love another dog in the home. She also needs a home with a secure yard. Busy households or those with young kiddos will most likely be too much for sweet Luna.\n\nGiven time and the proper environment, Luna will make a great family member. Our support network of fosters, adopters and resident trainers is available to help. \n\nLuna is a spectacular Great Pyrenees. She is very sweet but her breed needs to have a job and a very secure, big yard. She was surrendered to a shelter saying she was aggressive - that is so far from the truth. Turned out she was pregnant and her defenses were high, her puppies have found homes and now it is her turn! She has shown nothing but love and respect. She is 4 years old and around 77 pounds.\n\nSweet Luna is ready for her furever home. She is completely potty trained and so loves to play. In time, she will lay on your lap and snuggle!!! Our resident trainer will be involved with Luna's adoption process in order to best set everyone up for success. Serious and experienced adopters only will be considered for our very special and beautiful Luna.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process. Thank you for your interest in adopting a Dallas DogRRR.",

National Pyr (NGPR) is a coalition of rescuers that rescues Pyrs and Pyr mixes from Southern kill shelters where these large breed dogs last only a few days. After dogs are pulled from shelters, they are assessed, vetted, spayed or neutered and quarantined for two weeks or more before going to a foster home.\n\nThere are not enough foster homes in the places the dogs come from so dogs are transported to foster families around the country where they can live in a home environment and interact with kids, cats, people and other dogs. Every dog that goes into foster home allows us to pull another dog from a shelter.\n\nPlease go to National Great Pyrenees Rescue (NGPR) at  nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed  to learn more about the breed. Then if you are interested, please read about fostering at www.nationalpyr.org/fostering  then fill out our volunteer application at \nnationalpyr.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=1910  if you can help and we will get back to you shortly. We thank you and our beloved Pyrs thank you too.\n\nIf you can't foster or adopt at this time, please consider helping our Neediest Cases at  www.nationalpyr.org/neediest-2020 \n\nLove this breed? NGPR now has a Rescue Store at  www.cafepress.com/nationalpyr  where your purchase goes to help our rescue dogs and neediest cases.",

            "description": "Lucky wasn\u2019t always so lucky. Found dumped in a parking lot in Texas, Lucky spent the first few months of life fighting fleas, mange, which made him lose almost all of his fur, and the effects of extreme starvation. His luck changed when someone cared enough to take this puppy in and get him into foster care with Pets Going Places, Fetch\u2019s Texas partner [you can see photos and videos of Lucky\u2019s early days on the PGP Facebook page].\n\nWhen Lucky was healthy enough, he traveled to Wisconsin to be a Fetch foster dog, arriving in Wisconsin in December of 2019. However, as he matured from a puppy to a dog, it became apparent that the dire conditions he was found in had, not surprisingly, left their mark on his.\n\nThough Lucky has grown into a beautiful dog with a full healthy black coat, he required a double knee surgery in May. The eight-week recovery time was rough on him, as it would be on any young and active pup, but he got through it.  At the time of Lucky\u2019s surgery, it was found that he was also showing signs of hip dysplasia at his young age. To help with his knee surgery recovery and hip issues Lucky takes a daily glucosamine supplement. We use Cosequin and Lucky gets 1-2 of these chews daily.\n\nBehavior-wise, Lucky needed to be taught rules and boundaries (which is true of any young dog), and completed a board and train with a professional trainer, which has helped him become a much better-behaved pup. At board and train, Lucky Learned to be more confident. The trainer believes Lucky\u2019s behavior is a mix of him being scared, wanting to protect himself and his family, and handle things his way. He just needs someone to show him that they are in charge and he has no need to be scared or protective all the time. \n\nHe would do best in a home with an owner who is comfortable continuing to enforce the rules and boundaries Lucky learned in training, so that he can be his best self. Lucky knows the basic commands (sit, down, off, lay down) . Lucky is a great leash walker. He does need some reminders when walk by other people or dogs that we are doing a job and he is to stay focused. To help keep him focused, we use a prong collar when walking. Now that he is recovered from his knee surgery, there are no concerns with him taking walks, and he really looks forward to our daily walks. However due to his hips and knees and regaining strength after surgery, we only go for about 20 minutes each walk and we do this twice a day.  We are watching how he does with these walks and hope to be able to increase walk time as he builds strength. Lucky also loves to play ball. Footballs are his favorite and I call him my favorite running back.  Footballs may be his favorite but a good tennis ball is a close second.  Lucky also recently discovered that he really loves to play in the sand. Nightly walks to the park have become his favorite thing and he looks forward to his sandy shenanigans.\n\nLucky is crated at night and for breaks during the day, and he does very well with being kenneled. He does cry some when put in at night but quiets down pretty quickly. During the day when we leave and he is kenneled we tell him to kennel and he runs happily to his kennel and sits to wait because he knows there\u2019s always a treat involved.\n\nLucky currently lives with four other dogs, and he has exhibited food aggression toward the other dogs and cats in the home. He doesn\u2019t like anyone touching his dish.  To avoid issues, Lucky is fed meals in his kennel during meal time. Basic treats, bones and antlers have not been an aggression issue in our home but rawhides were found to cause problems so we don\u2019t give them anymore. Aside from meal time, Lucky gets along just fine with the other dogs. Since coming back from board and train he has exhibited some dominant playing behaviors. He is reprimanded and taken inside when we are outside or to his kennel if we are inside for some quiet time when he exhibits this behavior. Lucky hasn\u2019t exhibited any issues with cat friends. If Lucky is adopted into a home with other dogs or cats, I\u2019d recommend slow introductions between him and his new fur friends, and I can help walk you through that process.\n\nLucky also lives with my two kids ages 7 and 13, and regularly interacts with other elementary-school aged kids, as I take in kids for daycare two days a week. He does well with the kids in our home but I think Lucky\u2019s ideal forever home would be kid-free, as their movements sometimes make him nervous. Lucky is also very nervous around new people.\n\nDespite his terrible start in life, Lucky has proven to be one of the most loving and sweet pups I have ever fostered. My wish for him is that he finds a forever family that will be understanding and patient with him since he has already been through so much in his first year of life, and who will continue to help him be the best dog he can be. \n\n",

            "description": "Howdy, my name's Paisley! I'm a 2 year old Doberman Pinscher who's looking for her very own herd to call her own. I'm about 80 lbs but trying to cut down on the barbecue. How can I guard the barn with a belly too full of brisket?!\n\nI'm a very good girl who does wonderful in the barn but do like to renovate so need to be put in the stall when you leave and offered many toy options when you're home so I forget my HGTV tendencies. I know to go potty in the pasture/yard and settle quickly in the stall when you're away. I know all my basics like sit, lie down and I can even pray for my food with my eyes open till you say okay and amen. Though I love runnin and playin in the pasture I'm not an outside dog(no dog should be) so be ready for couch cuddles!\n\nOne thing I get confused of are cats in my barn, they can just be too dang hard not to chase so would be best to find one without. I do love other dogs but have zero experience with actual livestock. I also get nervous when interacting with youngin's so would be better suited for a barn full of adults or older teens, they give me the best pettin!\n\nIf you'd like to be my forever family please fill out an adoption application at www.hhfrescue.org!\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

This young lady is absolutely knock gorgeous, with her unique coloration, her perfect stride, her solid symmetry and great demeanor. This is all a gift from God to us, you see Mocha was intentionally being starved to death by a hideous person. Thankfully we were able to rescue her but it took police intervention and court proceeding to get her, I believe that the powers that be did not believe that that someone this evil could actually exist. Enough of that, what we now have is a dog with great human skills, has tremendous love of kids and plays extremely well with other dogs.\n\n Mocha will try to be by your side at all times, constantly seeking your approval, trying to steal an ear rub or by chance nuzzle a treat from your pocket. Mocha performed very well in all of our socialization and training programs, reflecting high intelligence, strong people drive, strong desire to train and great social skills with other dogs. Mocha, fully filled out, probably be in the 80 pound range, she is also around 3 years old but plays like a puppy. This girl is a no brainer when it comes to choosing a new family member.\n\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CLICK THE SPONSOR ME, ADOPT ME OR CONTACT THIS ORGANIZATION.

We offer full disclosure and hope to make the best matches possible. Please know our adoption fees never cover our expenses. We rely on the generosity of our adopters and supporters to help us help the dogs. \n\nOur rescue is only in the business of offering full disclosure to adopters, and expects and hopes to engage your questions and concerns fully. We owe it to the dogs we rescue and all the wonderful families/adopters who might consider welcoming our charges into their hearts and home. Our dogs are waiting for that ideal forever home where they will be cherished as deserving family members. It's sad these second chances are even necessary for these dogs, but we are committed to them and will devote the time and energy to their re-homing, and not just move them to save more dogs. We diligently and responsibly seek good matches, as we don't want to re-home the dog again. These animals have already endured more than they should have, and through no fault of their own. It behooves us to be honest and forthright, and we appreciate the same in return from applicants. It's that winning combination of reciprocal trust and respect that allows for successful placements to be made. Happy adopters translate to happy dogs, and that's our goal! \n\nRESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5013C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n\nALL interested adopters MUST complete an application; agree to a vet reference check, phone interview and home visit. ALL family members MUST be in attendance for home visits - no exceptions. This helps us get to know everyone in the family so that we can help find the right dog for you. . \n\nDisclaimer: Please note that the breeds posted on our dogs' biographies are our best guess based on years of working with rescue dogs. Adopters who need to know the exact breed or mix of breeds of a particular dog must have the dog's DNA tested at their own expense.\n\n<center><b>TO SEE MORE PHOTOS OF THIS DOG AND ALL OUR ADOPTABLE DOGS,<br>please check out our website at <a href=\"http://rescuedogvillage.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Dog Village</a></b>.</center>\n\n",

He\u2019s a big boy, about 70 pounds, and can be jumpy, so he needs someone who is willing to work with him on leash training and manners. Kevin is a very strong dog and we would recommend an experienced dog owner for him. Kevin needs to be the only pet in his new home. We would also recommend older children for him because of his strength and energy level.\n\nKevin is 1-2 years old and was brought in as a stray. Kevin is a high-energy dog and always wants to go go go. He would greatly benefit from a family who can give him a lot of exercise and provide him with structure. Though he\u2019s very energetic he\u2019s also quite content to cuddle with you on the couch after playtime. He\u2019s such a love bug! \n\nKevin is always happy and ready for a new adventure. This goofball is treat-motivated and willing to learn! He just needs that special someone who can help him learn how to be his best! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Kevin please give us a call to schedule an appointment. 724-339-7388",

Things you will learn about Chevelle on your first date: This stocky & blocky Adonis wrinkles up his little nose when he sniffs and when he snacks. He is not great at catching treats with his mouth, but his broad back makes a great landing strip for them. He has high cuddle bug potential - he will try to crawl into your lap... and he WILL kiss on the first date. He is a card-carrying member of #teamjowls- not for their dangliness but for their scrunchiness. There is no doubt you'll want to be swiping right on this guy! It doesn't take long for Chevelle to fall in love with you and let his personality shine. This goofy boy loves treats and cuddling, making him an excellent candidate for your binge-watching needs! He has a lot of love to give and is looking for that special someone... could it be you? Follow Chevelle on Instagram @chevelle_muscle_dog",

He is fully-vetted and house-trained.   He is located in Sanger, TX and it is required that you travel there to meet him in person to adopt, no exceptions. We do need the entire party to be involved when meeting available dogs, including every family member and dog(s) that currently live in your home.\n\nRicochet is an EXUBERANT, bouncy, extremely energetic boy that needs a home with a good, tireless throwing arm, as he LOVES fetch with tennis/chuck-it balls and frisbees!   As a puppy, and while growing up, we know that he lived in an apartment and was forced inside a crate for long periods of time, thus he becomes VERY upset when crated.  He would do best with an adopter that is home the majority of the time, so he can get all of the attention he has always deserved!\n\nRicochet gives 110% at all times, but he can come in and relax as well.  Since he plays and runs hard, his ideal future family will not have young children, senior/frail dogs, or tiny animals.  He would do best with a sturdy female playmate of similar size.  At this time, we do not know how Ricochet does with cats.\n\nDue to his smarts and energy, we would not consider him for the first-time Aussie owner.  Ricky would do well with an abundance of exercise and some training classes... as he is a fast-learner and both treat/toy motivated.   He is a very nice boy that deserves a permanent home!",

She is currently located in Gainesville, TX and it is required that you travel there to meet her in person to adopt, no exceptions. We do need the entire party to be involved when meeting available dogs, including every family member and dog(s) that currently live in your home.  \n\nBeauty was very loved and struggled with the loss of her owners by initially going on a hunger strike.  Unfortunately, she also tested heartworm positive. \n After taking time to get settled and acquainted, and having her heartworms treated, she is now doing well and has adjusted to life in foster care.\n\nBeauty is a sweet, confident girl that was given a lot of freedoms in her past life, so it important that her future home have experience with extra-smart Aussies that try to take an inch if given a mile.  She is learning how to not push through doorways, and working very hard to stop fence-quarrelling with her neighbor dogs.  Due to this, her future home is required to have a fence-type that is not \"see through\" (no wrought-iron, chain-link, etc.)\n\nBeauty is house-broken and leash-trained.  She would love to be either an only dog, or have a handsome male dog to share her time with.  She will not be placed in a home with an existing female dog, just to ensure keeping the peace.  Beauty would also do best without cats --- she has some strong prey drive!  She is not the biggest fan of a crate, but has done well when left uncrated.  \n\nBeauty deserves a home where can be the center of attention, and no longer be passed around.  Could that be you!?",

She was rescued, vetted and came to America to find her forever home!  \n\nYetta is in need of someone that can give her a lot of time, structure and most importantly consistency.  She is a shy and somewhat timid girl at first but is sweet, happy and playful! Because she is young dog that has not had any training, she does need a lot of attention to get her on the right track.   She is currently working on crate and house training so needs routine and patience at this time. She is still working on leash training so having a secure yard to work on this is a needed. Yetta is good with other dogs so having another playful dog is a plus. Because of Yetta's timid nature, older kids for now.\n\nINTERESTED IN THIS PUP?

If you did not know her age she acts like a 2-3 year old not a 8 ish year old.  Wants to be with you and on your lap, sleeps under with covers in bed with you.  Walks pretty well on a leash, bounces around some.  Has food issues with other dogs if feeding the same time.  Can have issues sharing toys.  Emmie has cute look about her and adorable underbite and ears.  She lays in a different way than normal dogs.  This girl marches to the beat of her own drum. \n\n9.11.2020 working on better pics and a video.\n\nHappy to answer questions about her via email.  Applications can be filled out at tailsofrescue.org.  Koi is spayed, chipped, heart worm negative, current on rabies, kennel cough and Dhpp.  We do not ship animals and meet and greets and pick up is in Redding CA.   Adoption fee is $150\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Madonna (GA) is a female American Pit Bull Terrier mix rescued in Georgia. Our veterinary partner estimates that Madonna is 2 years old at the time of intake in September 2020. Madonna is a shy girl who is good with people and great with kids, although she prefers females. She is timid of her human brother and will hid from him. She is good with other dogs with slow introductions. Madonna was found tethered to a tree out in the woods. When we picked up Madonna, she was suffering from wounds sustained when she was attacked by another dog. We were horrified to also discover many scars and broken and missing teeth. We shudder to think what life was like for this girl thus far! Madonna also had a mammary tumor removed. The biopsy came back as benign hyperplasia and is NOT cancer. That's one win in her favor, now to find her a forever home! Madonna is super sweet but scared/fearful of quick hand movements and has been working on her leash skills. In addition to slow introductions to other dogs with proper decompression, it is recommended that her new home NOT have cats. She hasn't shown aggression at the vet's office to the office kitty, but she IS clearly uncomfortable with the cats. She prefers to eat in solitude in her crate and not have to worry about others taking her food. We really want to show Madonna that life is full of wonder, love, companionship and can indeed be happy! If you can give Madonna that home, please apply online to adopt Madonna (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

(He could stand to add on a few pounds-he needs a home to plump him up-just sayin').  Catfish has a bum leg that is being assessed by the Dr. to determine if it will heal or if he needs to have his little leg amputated.  He would love to have a home where he could heal or recover from surgery in a warm cushy bed-surrounded by love.  Catfish is most interested in hugs!! He is extremely sweet and affectionate!!  This beautiful brindle boy needs a cuddle mate to adopt him and make him theirs furrever!!\n\nIf you would like to meet one of our Homeless Pets during the week at the Town and Country Veterinary Clinic it is best to fill out an application first and schedule an appt.

Since then, Archie has been charming every person he's met, flashing his adorable snaggletoothed grin at them.\n\nStocky lowrider Archie is super friendly, great on a leash, housebroken, and crate trained,  Archie loves rawhide chewies, snacks, naps, cuddling, walks, meals, car rides, snuggling, and Squeaky Balls!!  \n\nArchie's favorite place is on the couch next to his people, helping them watch TV, read, or otherwise relax.  His second favorite place is at the end of a leash while out on a walk (he's a great walking companion).  He's also pretty happy to go for a car ride.\n\nArchie is generally good with other dogs, but seems to dislike some larger males and can be growly with them if they invade his space. We don't know how he is with cats.  He seems more comfortable with older children (12 and up) than with younger ones.\n\nArchie is about 4yo, and weighs about 45 lb.  He is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and parasite screened.  His adoption fee is $300 cash and he is eligible for foster-to-adopt within the Chicago metro area.\n\nFor more information and an adoption application, please email UnderdogRailway@yahoo.com\n\n**We take pandemic safety very seriously.  All meet-and-greets will be outdoors, observing appropriate masking and distancing protocols.**",

We will not respond to petfinder inquiries regarding any information already publicly posted.** Please take time to read the information provided and complete an application if interested.** Incomplete applications will not be considered.**\n\nHi! My name is Stanley! \nI am about 3-4 years old and I weigh around 14 pounds. I am neutered, have had a dental, am current on vaccines, microchipped, on heartworm and flea prevention. I would love a home with a single person as I get very attached to, \u201cmy person.\u201d I am looking for an adopter local to Mt. Pleasant, SC as unfortunately I am heartworm positive. Treatment will be completed post-adoption by my rescues vet. My rescue covers the cost of this treatment. I will require professional grooming. Please list the groomer that you use or intend to use in the, \u201canything else\u201d section of the application. \nMy adoption fee is $395. \n\nPlease submit an application if you want to make me part of your family! \nMeet and greets are scheduled with approved adopters. \nCopy the link below and paste it into your browser for an application:\n\nhttp://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/wACc22HN2JDb60dtb465Z \n\n\nOur adoption process consists of an application, and reference checks. We do home visits when a reference check is not enough. You must be at least 21 years old to apply to adopt.\nPlease fill out all fields as accurately as possible. We will not process incomplete applications. \n\nAdoptions are made on a best home basis. If two excellent applications come in for the same dog, our policy is first in time, first in line. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs. Our dogs are in private foster homes waiting to be adopted. Due to limited foster space, we are unable to hold an animal to be adopted out at a later time.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents of our dogs and puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. \n\nWe rely solely on adoption fees and donations to provide care for our rescued animals, many of whom have incurred medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The fees received act to help support the organization as a whole, allowing them to continue efforts to rescue animals from high-kill shelters in South Carolina and Georgia.",

We do not ship our dogs and all adoptions are completed in person in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area. Oh my, hi, hi. I am Trinket. I am a chorkie that is over ten years old. I came to the rescue years ago and was recently returned because I don't like change. My other family was traveling alot and it was really stressing me out. Do you have a quiet home for a special needs girl. Yes, I have some quirks that you will either love or not. When I get nervous I spin in circles, chase my tail and growl. Ok, so it may look weird but if you tell me to stop I will. I like other dogs. I am house and crate trained. I like toys and to play. Right now I am overweight and working on losing a pound or two. I am too small to have extra weight on my joints at my age. I have been spay, vaccinated and micro chipped. I had my teeth cleaned and lost a lot. It doesn't stop me from eating but my tongue doesn't always stay in my mouth now either. I am current on heartworm/flea and tick preventative. My adoption fee is 100.00. The first step in adopting me is to complete an application at dogsasfamily.org for Trinket. Maybe I could bring a smile to your face?",

We do not ship our dogs and all adoptions are completed in person in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area. Hi, my name is Dora. I am about a year old and I weigh fifty pounds. I came to the rescue after I was found in the woods with a new puppy. Sadly, I had five but when they found me there had been a lot of rain and only one was alive. I did my best but there was so much water. Anyways, I took care of Daisy until she was old enough to leave my side and its time for me to find a home of my own. I am young and playful. I like some other dogs but I will admit a few little yacky ones have bugged me. Toys are ok and running in the fenced yard is fun. Please don't misunderstand I want to live in the house with you and just play and potty outside. I am young and could benefit from learning more proper manners. Do you have time to help me learn? I want to love you and have a real home I can call ours. I have been spay, vaccinated and microchipped. I am current on heartworm/flea/tick preventatives. My adoption fee is 150.00. The first step in adopting me is to complete an application for Dora at dogsasfamily.org. I think a home and family is the best thing ever.",

            "description": "*Bonnie's adoption fee has been WAIVED if you are approved to adopt! Please come to the shelter and meet our sweet, ball-loving girl!*\n\nBonnie\n\nBreed: American Pit Bull Terrier mix\nHousetrained: Partially, will likely do well on a schedule\nGood with cats: No\nGood with other dogs: No\nGood with children: Does best with older children \nKnows: Sit, her name\nPreferred home environment: Securely fenced-in yard required\nIntake date/origin: April 27, 2014, found stray\nVetting: Already spayed, microchipped, and UTD on vaccines including rabies\nAdoption fee: WAIVED for an approved applicant \n\nPlayful to the core, there is no doubt that Bonnie would engage in a game of fetch 24/7 if given the opportunity - but not with just any toy, of course. Bonnie's favorite toy is the good, old-fashioned tennis ball. You can often find this carefree girl blissfully rolling around on the ground with a ball in her mouth and her paws in the air. Sweet, athletic, and just a bit silly, Bonnie is ready to start a whole new game of fetch.\n\nThat is, fetching for a new home.\n\nUnfortunately, life hasn't always been fun and games for Bonnie. In 2014, she was found as a pregnant stray. Even after her puppies were all adopted, no one came for Bonnie. Ever since then, despite our many efforts at finding her a home, no one has given Bonnie a second glimpse.\n\nBorn in 2010, Bonnie waits daily for someone to give her a chance. Having spent time in foster care a few years ago, Bonnie does have some manners as far as living in a home is concerned. She is partially housetrained and will likely do well once on a consistent schedule. Bonnie's favorite things are spending time with people, enjoying Kongs filled with peanut-butter, and playtime. During fetch, she does well if you trade one toy for another. If Bonnie wants one of her toys or treats, she can be pretty determined to get it, so a home with no young children will be best. Bonnie also has a high prey drive, so she must be the only pet and have a securely fenced-in yard.\n\nHaving spent many years in our care, Bonnie is more than ready to find her new family. Will you be the person to give Bonnie the chance she's been dreaming of? Apply to adopt her at www.lovingheartanimalshelter.org/adopt.",

            "description": "Sweet Hydrangea has such a striking spotted coat! She is about 2 years old and we think a mix of Pointer and Terrier (and probably several other breeds) give her the beautiful freckled appearance. Cuddles and pets are her absolute favorite, so if you're looking for a loving dog she could be the gal for you! Hydrangea is an easy-going gal, perfectly content to hang at home with you and be the easiest coworker you'll have. While her foster family has been working on getting her out to see the world with car rides to the beach and meandering walks around the nearby park, she is a pretty low key girl whose mantra is eat, snuggle, sleep then repeat! Hydrangea sleeps in her crate without a peep all night and is house trained in her current foster home. She knows her basic commands and is learning how to play fetch. She can be left home alone uncrated without any issues, but would prefer if her humans were around more often than not. When Hydrangea first arrived she was very shy but she is gaining confidence in her foster home, going on short hikes with her foster family and learning to love to play with her people! Hydrangea is indifferent to other dogs and doesn't really play, so would be a great companion for a senior dog or as the only dog in her home. She has met a few kids of various ages and has done really well with all of them. If you think Hydrangea would be a great addition to your home, your first step is submitting an adoption application on our website. If you are already approved with an adoption coach or have adopted from us before, reach out to your coach for the next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life! Dogs + Love = Family",

Eugene may be able to live with another dog, but he is very selective with his doggy friends. Eugene cannot live with cats. He would do best in a home with adults only. \n\nEugene has a ton of energy and is extremely smart, so he will need a family willing to work with him on training. He will need positive reinforcement to help him with manners, as he can become overly excited sometimes. Because he has so much energy and is so intelligent, it will be important for Eugene's family to give him not only a lot of physical exercise, but mental enrichment as well. \n\nIf you want to open your home to a new dog like Eugene, please fill out an application.\nThinkingoutsidethecage.org/Application",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nMarley Shea is a very friendly and outgoing 1.5 year-old girl who was surrendered to a shelter by her family who said she was too active for them. The shelter listed her breed mix as Boxer and Greyhound but we think there might be a little Pittie in her family tree too. From the shelter, Marley Shea made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she would be able to take her time finding the perfect new home. Marley Shea loves other dogs and is very playful with them so would enjoy having a playful canine buddy in her new home. That would help her blow off some steam each day. Once playtime is over, she settles down nicely in her crate for a nap. She has had excellent crate manners in her foster home so may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee that. For a big dog, she walks quite nicely on a leash so would make a great hiking or jogging buddy for an active person or family. Marley Shea weighs about 55 pounds and her adoption fee is $250. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Marley Shea. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Marley Shea and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "APALO is a 1 year old Terrier Lab mix taken in as a stray on 9/2/20. He's a runner, accustomed to roaming randomly and journeying to his heart's content, perhaps seeking that special someone who'll ramble with him. Besides his on the go nature, two other things stand out about Apalo, his constant smile and athletic build. There's no doubt about Apalo's friendliness: he loves to give kisses and craves companionship. Very vocal in his kennel, he's expressing his desire to be with people, rather than confined alone in a kennel or a fenced yard. With great enthusiasm, energy and strength, Apalo is eager to get out and stretch his legs, but he's going to need some guidance on how to be a fantastic walker or runner on a lead. He's very strong and athletic and will literally run away with you. With some training this guy could make a fantastic running buddy. Like so many dogs, Apalo needs the right guidance, mental and physical exercise, and an owner/family who'll actively engage with him. Even if this guy turns out to be a couch potato, at this point, he'll fare best with one who spends time doing things WITH him. Apalo's adoption fee is $150. He's neutered, current on shots, dewormed, microchipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive.",

I would prefer a home with no kids, no other animals, lots of blankets, tennis balls, a high fence(not required a tether is fine), ohhh do you have a fireplace?  I like to hike, I really love that thing my foster parents call Netflix.  I'm fully crate trained and potty trained(I'm a grown ass adult afterall).  \nMy new people will need to be patient with me as I am still learning to trust new people, but bring me a hot dog or stinky treat and I will be in your lap in no time! \n\nIf you are interested in meeting one of our pups please fill out an application on our website https://petsstophererescue.com/. After the reference check is completed we will be contacting you to schedule a meet and greet. Our adoption process is as followed: application, reference check, landlord approval (if needed), meet and greet, home inspection and home trial run (aka sleepover). Please note we are a volunteer based rescue and work timelessly to ensure all our dogs find the best homes possible. Our Petfinder page is updated regularly, if we receive multiple applications for a pup we will review ALL of them and pursue the best fit. Adoption fees range from $250-$400. Our dogs come fully vetted. Any questions please contact Kaylee at kglidden312@gmail.com. We look forward to helping you find your new best friend!\n\n*PSA: We ONLY adopt to residents of Rochester, NY and surrounding towns. Out of state / country applications will be discarded (including Canada) due to different breed restrictions. Thank you for understanding and we apologize for any inconvenience's.*",

He was immediately evaluated by our vets, and determined he had disc issues. The vet advised against a very expensive surgery, which has limited chance of success.\n\nGilligan has improved while he has been at the shelter with medication and restricted activity. He will be neutered in the near future and has been fully vetted and vaccinated. He gets along well with his shelter siblings, and loves playtime.\nGilligan will require an adopter that has had previous experience with a pet that has had back issues as he will need to be monitored constantly.\n",

            "description": "Duke is a big, handsome hunk who is patiently awaiting his forever home! Actually he has been waiting for 90 days as of 12/09/20 and is now at Diamond Dog status. Duke has a fun and playful side. He is suggested to be the only animal in the home. He would do well with children, but given his size we would suggest older children. Duke is now a Diamond dog and his adoption fee is $75. Adoption fees includes his neuter, microchip, rabies vaccination and heartworm test. Duke is heartworm positive but thanks to Rockwall PAWS, once he is adopted he will be able to get treatment with little or no cost to the adopter. RAC staff is happy to answer any questions you have about heartworms and the treatment. If you are interested in adopting Duke, please complete an application online at https://rockwalladoptions.com/adoptfoster/adoption-application/ Age: 2 yrs Weight: 80 lbsAll animals unless otherwise noted in their descriptions are at 1825 Airport Road, Rockwall, TX.

She loves kids and adults.  Suzie\u2019s smile when she is happy is her key to being spoiled!! She can be dog \nselective and does best with male dogs. She was born in June 2016 and is located at the rescue. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

            "description": "This is Benji who is a three year old, 20 pound, dark grey, Miniature Schnauzer boy with natural ears and tail.  Benji has been in training since he was taken in by MSRH in June, due to aggressiveness towards men.  He would tolerate a woman but was still unsure of being handled.  With time and work he has shown improvement.  We feel he would do best in a home environment with a single lady that wants to devote time for training.  He is a one-person dog and thrives on the bond with his pet parent.  He also does well with a routine and doesn't handle changes very well. We do not think he would do well in a home where there are children.  He will also not do well in a home with another dog as long as he is having some behavioral issues.  Benji has two more lessons that will be given free of charge to his new adopter. Once he has been adopted, we feel that these should start within the first 3 days in the home, as we don't want him to form any unhealthy habits.  Also, these issues were in a kennel atmosphere but it could change for the better in a home setting and also when he is comfortable with new humans.  If you have the patience and time for some training Benji just might be the boy for you.\nContact Miniature Schnauzer Rescue of Houston at msrh.org and complete the Adoption Application.\nAdoption Fee $450",

            "description": "Cesar is a six year old Labrador/Pitbull mix that came to our shelter after his owner passed away.  Once a beloved family member, he is used to living inside a home and completely housebroken.  He is a big handsome boy that weighs sixty five pounds and has a shiny chocolate colored coat. Cesar is best suited for an adult household with someone that is home most of the day.  He prefers to be the only dog but does do well with cats.  Cesar is reserved and likes to take a moment to get to know you.  Once he is comfortable, you\u2019ll quickly see his more playful side emerge.  This boy is infatuated with balls and will play fetch for hours.  Just follow these three simple rules:  1) Use non-chewable Kong balls; he can chew right through a regular tennis ball; 2) Set a time limit; playing too long leads to over excitement; 3) Once fetch time is over put the balls away; otherwise Cesar will hoard them and can be possessive.  He will need a fenced in yard so he can safely play and explore outside.  Other than that, Cesar likes to spend most of his day just lounging around the house.  He is fairly laid back and easy to please.  Cesar is a mature dog that would love to be your devoted best friend.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.

            "description": "This handsome guy is Drano!\n\nWe believe he is a boxer/pit mix. He is around 11 months old and is the sweetest boy! He came to us from a full shelter in Tenneseee where he was at risk, due to space. He does have quite a bit of energy, but loves playing with other dogs, so his ideal fur-ever home would have a fur-friend that likes to play, a fenced in yard to play in or an active family!\n\nHe is working on potty training and basic manners.\n\nDrano went on an overnight outing with one of our fosters and did awesome they said! He walked well on leash, was good around their younger daughter and loved to play in their fenced in yard! He was also respectable with their small dogs.\n\nAn approved adoption application is required. The $275 adoption fee (payable by cash only) includes spay/neuter; microchip; dental teeth cleaning (if needed prior to adoption); age appropriate vaccinations; and heartworm testing if dog is over 6 months old. Our adoption application may be found by going to: www.headinhomerescue.org; then click on the link to the adoption application. Dogs for adoption may be seen by appointment only following an approved application. Proof of completion of an obedience class is required for all dogs following adoption. Please note: while we welcome out of state applications, we do not ship our animals and require adopters to come to Holland to finalize any adoption.",

            "description": "Bella is a sweet, affectionate 4 year old 50 pound girl.  She has thrived in foster care with 1 person in a quiet household, and has learned manners and is house trained.  Bella did spend a lot of her life outdoors, and gets overwhelmed in homes with too much activity and nips.  Her ideal home would let her have downtime away from people. Bella has started working on crate training while here at the shelter and is doing well being crated in a plastic or reinforced wire crate. She is looking for a home that will continue working with her to help make her comfortable in her crate while she is unsupervised. Bella loves to be active and in a home that can provide her with plenty of physical and mental stimulation!\nPlease call or email for more information on Bella! \n\nMost of our dogs are currently in shelter - but some are in foster homes.  If you would like to see a specific dog, feel free to contact us to see if they are in shelter or in foster care!  Dogs in shelter are available to visit or adopt daily.  IF a dog is in a foster home, they come in on Saturdays from 11:00am to 4:00pm. Arrangements can be made to have specific dogs brought in during the week- just give us a call or email to see if the dog you are interested in is in a foster home and set up a meeting time if necessary.\n\nOur adoption fees include the following: all of our dogs/puppies are current on vaccinations (DHPP and Rabies if over 3 months of age) at the point of adoption, dewormed, heartworm tested and current on preventative, microchipped, treated for fleas/ticks and are spayed or neutered. Our large dog adoption fee is generally $150 + tax. Our small dog and puppy adoption fee is generally $250 + tax. Adoption fees may vary in special circumstances. Due to space limitations, we do not hold dogs.\n\nBecause we are on a busy street, we require that all dogs leaving the shelter be in a carrier or on leash. All pets remain up for adoption until an approved application is processed and their adoption fee paid. Adoptions will stop a half hour before we close, at 5:30pm M-F and 3:30pm Saturday.",

Housetrained and kennel trained, and good on leash.  Requirements for adoption include good vet history, fenced yard (no exceptions) and a live or virtual home visit required for approval.

He exhibited some behaviors the family was not experienced enough to deal with and felt it best for him to try and find a new home, better equipped to manage him. We were told the normal dog behaviors of chewing and getting into the trash was fine and preventable. He did enjoy jumping up on the bed and sofa, again, to each his own but Metro was beginning to guard his food...once in a while. He would turn and snap if you tried to sit down next to him on the sofa...once in a while. He would lunge at strangers...once in a while. Walking on a leash he is perfect most of the time...occasionally he will react and lunge at other dogs walking by. These behaviors only came out occasionally but they did come out and potential adopters should be prepared to manage them as Metro continues to get settled into a new home. These behaviors can be managed but you must be willing and able to do so.\n\nMetro Station is a barker in the shelter cage but this did not transfer to a home where he was generally quiet and calm. Metro is sweet and friendly. He enjoys the company of humans, not so much of other dogs or cats. He loves to run around and stretch his legs in a nice yard or on a walk which he is perfect on a leash. He doesn't chase after tennis balls very much, but he does love to play with toys, flipping them left and right and throwing them around. Metro is smart, knows a few commands and loves to be rewarded. He enjoys treats, takes them pretty softly, too. He is, however, a bit cautious when it comes to his ears as he has chronic ear infections which will mean continuous medical care and attention to his ears. This also means he doesn't like too many people messing with his head or ears so young children should always be monitored when around Metro Station and adults should also be careful not to mess with his ears. Metro Station is waiting to meet you! He is a boy who will most likely fit easily into your home as long as you are willing to give him time to settle in and get accustomed to his new home, routine, and family. Call 385-4444 or go to our facebook page to make an appointment to meet him. Thanks for choosing adoption! Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road, open daily except for Tuesdays.",

She is good in her kennel and goes in and out easily but doesn't like her crate to be disturbed once she is in it. She is not destructive out of the crate so, as an only dog, might not need to be crated. She loves to play fetch and loves to get treats. She will make herself at home on the couch if you let her and enjoys pets. Daisy is totally potty trained. Her ideal home would be an experienced, active owner with teenagers or all adults. Daisy would be a loyal companion and a great walking or jogging buddy. She is ready to find her new home today!",

Wilbert is very sweet with everyone he meets and gets along well with other dogs.\n\nWilbert walks well on leash and is crate trained. His fosters are working on house training and he's almost got it down. He is a very smart boy - he comes when called and knows the sit command. Wilbert is very active and doesn't know his own size and strength. He's a bit of a bull in a china shop, so he needs some work on his doggy manners.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting WILBERT NEWARK, please complete an adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org.",

She'a a happy gal that loves people and does well with other dogs. Danika's favorite things include treats, a good romp in the yard, and being a care-free puppy! She's very food motivated and would love a fenced in back yard.\n\nDanika is medium sized around 40 pounds and she has lots of silly puppy energy! We don't know how she is with cats or children. We do know she has a love of live and enough energy to wear out her dog foster siblings!\n\nDanika has a condition called ectopic ureters. She needs frequent potty breaks, and possibly a diaper at times. She doesn't let this slow her down though, and is a goofy pup!\n\nDanika is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and her adoption fee is $200. Interested in making this adorable girl a part of your family? Your first step is to fill out an application on our website! http://mhrindy.org/adoption-inquiry/***Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.***",

Xander has a tongue Gene Simmons would be jealous of and he uses it to give more kisses than anyone can handle! He's also got a knack for cuddling and being an all-around sweet boy! Xander has hit many milestones with his training! He knows sit, lay down and even goes to his crate when told (reluctantly, but hey a win is a win right?). Xander has also drastically increased skills on things like walking on a leash. He can be a tad on edge when meeting new people, and gets pretty excited to see doggy friends out and about. This isn't too big of a deal though, because Xander redirects easily when told. Xander does well with being pampered. He will let his people trim his nails, give him baths and brush him. He even tolerates a little dress up - okay he LOVES wearing his sweaters. Xander loves to greet people with two legged hugs, so someone who can explain to him what \"\"four on the floor\"\" means would be great! Xander likes to have something to entertain him while he is hanging in the crate, and he will be insulted if he knows you are home and not enjoying his presence. Xander may take a little time to warm up to other dogs and he likes to play a little rough. He would do best in a home where he is either the only dog, or his doggy sibling is more submissive. Xander does very well entertaining himself, but also loves to play fetch and tug of war! Xander has lots of residual puppy energy, so he would most likely thrive in a home with a fenced in yard and active family. Since he loves to give two legged doggy hugs, he may do best in a home without elderly folks, or too young of children. Xander absolutely loves his bubbles and needs a home that will accommodate this addiction. Xander is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and heartworm negative. Xander's adoption fee is $225. If you think you could be the perfect home for sweet boy Xander, you can apply to adopt him at www.pawpatroldayton.com/adopt. All of our animals are vaccinated, micro-chipped and spayed/neutered before being adopted.",

I\u2019m Henry, the tan and white handsome one, and that\u2019s Brutus my best friend, he\u2019s black and white and he\u2019s handsome too! Our foster mom tells us that I'm a Boxer pit mix and my brother is a pit mix and could have boxer in him. Here is our story. It was just Brutus and I all alone in the woods and we found a creek and a tree to sleep under, don\u2019t tell anyone but I\u2019m terrified of thunder! It was really scary being out there by ourselves. One day this lady came and started feeding us and giving us fresh water. She was the sweetest lady ever. Brutus tried to get me to trust her but I was just so scared. A few months later Brutus went to the sweet ladies home and I was too afraid to follow. They came back for me! I knew they would! I followed them to her house and I\u2019m back with my best friend again! They say she\u2019s our foster mom and she has dogs like us too! We love to hang out with them and her cats, but Brutus and I like to sleep even more. We were really tired when we first came to our foster mom\u2019s home. We slept all the time because we knew we were safe with her. It was amazing to sleep on a soft fluffy bed with Brutus. They say now were ready for our forever home. Brutus and I are inseparable and we want to go to a home that will take both of us handsome boys. We are very laid back, we know how to potty outside, our sweet foster mom took us to the vet and we have all our shots and they neutered us, they are even talking about giving us microchips before we go to our forever home! We don\u2019t mind being around kids, dogs, cats, but our most favorite thing of all, naps! I mean who can blame us? So anyways Brutus and I came to an agreement and we are ready to find our forever home to get unlimited loving and take unlimited naps!",

He's a shy boy, but has the sweetest heart once you get to know him! Peppy came to us completely shut down from our rural rescue partner in Georgia and has spent the last several months coming out of his shell. Peppy is untrusting of men, and requires at least one resident female in his forever home. Peppy loves other dogs, and requires at least one confident dog in residence. He doesn't mind cats, and currently lives with a cat in his foster home. Peppy will also need a fenced in backyard, as leash walking is extremely overwhelming to him. Peppy is looking for home away from busy side streets, as those noises can be a bit scary for a shy country boy!\n\nHis foster reports that he is docile boy, and loves to curl up in a bed. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Megan S\nLocation: Foster Home\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

When it comes to playing with other dogs I can be a bit selective when it comes to who I choose to play with but with the right partner, I can be very playful. I've got an ENORMOUS amount of energy and if you come by my room on the ranch, don't be surprised to see me jumping up and down through the window! I would be the best fit for an experienced dog owner who is well-versed in how to handle dogs with lots and lots of energy. I definitely need a home that has a large space for me to run around in and preferably one that doesn't have too many visitors, because I can be a little bit protective of my space when it comes to new people. I would absolutely benefit from continued training, particularly as I'm not quite completely potty trained yet (but I'm close!). I love to do anything active so if you are looking for a dog who wants to play fetch or join you on a walk or a run, I might be the guy for you! I love to play with toys and sometimes have to be reminded that some things are not toys and not for chewing. But even with all that extra energy, I still love some good quality time cuddling on the couch!",

            "description": "NOTE from PEANUT's foster family:     PEANUT is an outgoing, playful, affectionate, and athletic ball of energy, even though he rarely barks. He is just as happy chasing his tail in circles as he is cuddling like a lap dog. His foster family is working on leash training, and they report that he is \"a pleasure,\"  house-trained, and ready to please!      He  willingly and quietly goes into his crate at night. PEANUT would benefit from a fenced-in yard, or an active family who loves long walks. Also plan to make time for lots of hugs and snuggles from Peanut! <P>\n\n\n\nPEANUT is a handsome, 3-year-old, 55-pound, Labrador Retriever mix.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs.\n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY: Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins). An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals. Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please). This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.\n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He is very affectionate and loves massages and giving kisses.\nI know it is a tall order, but what would really make us happy is if Marcus could find a home where he is the only dog, or has a big bossy playful female. He does not do well with cats, small dogs and most big dogs. Marcus has been with Dog Days for a very long time looking for his perfect family. Marcus came to us from a horrible hoarding case and really deserves to be the king of his own castle. A castle full of loving people that love to smile and play as much as he does.\nIf you are interested in Marcus please email us at DogDaysRescue@gmail.com or vist https://petstablished.com/public/search/pet/196916\n\nMarcus loves to play! Will you be the one to give this curious, energetic boy all the love, fun and play that he deserves, but missed out on as a hoarding victim?\n\nadoption fee $100",

ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nBecause of behavioral issues, Elliott will be a permanent resident with SCMR; however, we will still need to care for him with funds made possible by wonderful donors like you.  If you would like to help support this boy's needs, SCMR would greatly appreciate it, and so will Elliott!!! \n\nElliott has an angel, and her name is Rebecca Cohen.  S.C.M.R. thanks you, and so does Elliott!!   \n\nThis handsome little fellow is about 8 years old and 10 pounds.   He was not gently treated, so he's wary of being handled, but once he feels safe, he will love to curl up nearby and keep you company.  \n\nElliot is a compact little boy who is house trained and active.  He loves a fenced yard and will guard his perimeter very noisily.  He gets along well with other dogs, ignores cats, but he is known to bite visitors.  When people drop by it's best to give him a time out in his crate.  Usually he chooses an open crate for naps anyway.  He likes doggie beds as well.\n\nElliot is chillin' in sunny Largo, Fl.\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

Thanks to my rescuers, my neck and paws are all better and I will start heartworm treatment in January.\n\nI'm a very sweet boy! I enjoy getting outside to sniff the fresh air and explore my surroundings, though I have to take it easy until my heart worms are treated. Once my heart worms are gone, I would like to run around and play like the young 3 year old that I am! I'm picking up on this whole house and crate training thing pretty quickly. I'm still learning how to be a good boy on leash...I sometimes get a little too excited! I enjoy playing with other dogs and learning new things.\n\nI'm feeling so much better since my rescue and the only thing that would make me feel even better would be to find a home of my own!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

This extremely handsome boy was a stray on the streets which took its toll on him and when the animal shelter called, ATDR immediately brought him into its loving fold. He's now in a comfortable foster home where he'll be receiving much needed veterinary care and will enjoy a good nutritious diet to try and put some meat on his thin little body. Rupert is one of the sweetest most loving dogs we have in rescue. He asks for nothing but delivers complete devotion to his humans! If you're looking for a comfortable best friend to share life and your sofa with, please submit an adoption application for Rupert.

            "description": "\"Mardi\"...a beautiful little southern girl, who has been through so much in her young life. Her wish is a home with an endless supply of love, toys and snuggles. \n\nMardi and her puppies were brought to New Hampshire (through a different rescue), to a short-term foster home until her puppies were old enough for adoption. Once ready, the puppies were placed for adoption but the rescue stated they couldn't take Mardi back. She was then brought to our shelter for adoption. \n\nMardi is 2-1/2 years old, 49 lbs., spayed and current on vaccinations. She is housebroken and knows basic commands. She is high energy and loves her walks. You might think being from the south, she wouldn't like the snow; guess again...she somersaults in it! Mardi loves toys. Her favorite is a rubber squeaky \"Sylvester\" the cat, whom she carries on her walks, happily squeaking along! Mardi adores human affection and seeks out snuggles on a regular basis. She is excellent at nose-work, always rising to the challenge of finding the treats. Mardi is a very smart pup who is eager to please. She would love an adopter willing to show her the adventures life has to offer. \n\nMardi needs an adopter who is committed to consistently working with her on dog reactivity. Being very treat motivated, she has been doing very well with consistent positive reinforcement training. She needs an active home with no dogs and no cats. Children in the home should be 14 and older. Mardi will do best in a quiet, low foot traffic environment. She is not a candidate for apartment/complex living.\n\nWe kindly ask, if you have questions regarding Mardi, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n**************************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-ap Primary Color: Brown Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 49.8lbs Age: 2yrs 5mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Z, and I'm a handsome 2.5-year-old Rat Terrier/Chihuahua mix who weighs 15 pounds. I look very serious in my photos because I've experienced some tough times during my life. I was rescued from someone who had way too many animals. Although I was adopted, I lost that home through no fault of my own - my owners needed to move. I'm a bit nervous because I've bounced around a bit.  Due to this, I might be a flight risk - so for my safety, I need a secure fenced yard.\n\nI love hanging out with my foster mom, but my foster dad still makes me nervous, so they think I would do best in a female only household and a home without kids. Ladies, if you have a husband, I\u2019ll probably avoid him for a long while. I\u2019m just meant to be a momma\u2019s boy. \n\nI'm pretty laid back. I can make friends with other canines as long as they are my size or bigger. Since I have been in foster care, it has become evident that I should not go to a home with cats or dogs smaller than me because I have a strong prey drive.\n\nMy minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents\n\nI have been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

We rescued Pax from a high-kill shelter, along with his half-siblings Mollie and Ollie, and three other dogs. We put them on their Freedom Ride for Life and they never looked back. Pax arrived on August 28, 2020. \nHe is a gem! Pax is thought to be a two-year old Labrador Retriever/American bulldog mix. He\u2019s compact in size at 52 lbs. Pax is adorable with a sleek white coat and a jaunty patch over one ear that gives him impish charm. Pax is always smiling and has a welcoming, friendly demeanor that makes you want to be around him. Pax is a calm and pretty chill little dude, but he loves to play. He seems to get along well with other dogs. He currently gets to play in the yard with his half siblings Mollie and Ollie and the three of them have a ball running around chasing each other. Pax has demonstrated that he will give chase to cats and should be placed in a home without them.\nPax is learning to walk on a leash and is doing great. He\u2019s a smart dog and learns quickly. He loves being with people and enjoys his time out of the kennel. We have fallen in love with Pax. He\u2019s just a great, solid and charming young dog. He\u2019s going to make for a great companion and will bring a lifetime of fun and love to the lucky person or family who adopts him. Get your application in for this wonderful doggo.\nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

            "description": "Iggy is a handsome, six month old, brindle Boxer/Lab mix that was relinquished by his owner after they decided their busy schedules didn\u2019t leave much time for him.   The lack of socialization has left Iggy with some rough edges.  Consequently, he needs consistent positive training to help him become his very best.  This adolescent pup needs an adult only home with a confident dog-savvy owner who has time to spend with him.  Iggy has an independent streak and reacts negatively sometimes when pushed beyond his boundaries.  Praise, patience, and training will help Iggy learn he can\u2019t always get his own way.  Iggy prefers wide open spaces to the tight confines of his kennel.  He is fearful of being boxed into a corner and we wouldn\u2019t recommend crating him.  Outside the shelter, Iggy is much more relaxed and has a blast playing with volunteers.  He especially loves running in the open field next to our pond.  If you enjoy an active lifestyle, Iggy would love to be your faithful companion.  He has lots of energy and is always ready for adventure.  Iggy is not fully housebroken as he lived most of his previous life outdoors.  A fenced in yard will assist with housetraining and give him a safe place to play.  Iggy is picky about his canine friends and would prefer to be the only dog in the home.  Iggy is a great dog with so much potential.  Are you ready to meet him?  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "Hehwoh,\n\nMy name is Weeble.\n\nI'm a Labraweimaranador.  Hehehehe\n\nMy mommy was was brought to Lucies Project in March 2018 with her tummy full of me and my brothers and sisters.  She was very sick and malnourished I'm told.  :(  Someone must have just dumped her, I don't know, but the great peeps here at Lucies came and picked her up at a church.  The pastor could not keep her, but knew that Lucies could help.  What a nice pastor....  Anyway, my Mommy was just there looking for help with her burden. \n\nWithin hours of being here, Mommy began giving birth to us, all 11 of us!  We were wonderful colors of silver, black and yellow.  Unfortunately within a few hours, 7 of my siblings went over the rainbow bridge.  (Sniff, sniff)\n\nThat left 2 silvers, 1 black/brown and one little yellow girl, my sissy.  I was the black/brown one. but now I am a chocolate color.  While I was outgoing, happy and healthy like my siblings, I was unsteady on my limbs and seemed to jerk and wobble.  Heck, I didn't know, I was just having fun!  That's where I got my name Weeble from!  :)\n\nIt soon became time for my mommy to find a new forever home in Canada.   My other siblings also have found other loving families across the big ole USA.\n\nNow it's just me here.  My doc feels like the base of my brain did not properly develop, which makes me weeble and wobble because of my difficulty with balance.  I'm just like any other doggie, except I walk like a Tennessee Trotter!  I wobble and shake when I try to be still.  \n\nI like to listen to the peeps here when they give me direction and teach me stuff.  I love to learn new things!  I am crate trained by the way.  :)  I have such a sweet, loving, and outgoing personality, adore kids and have a tremendous zest for life.  I'm a survivor after all!!\n\nI am extremely special to my friends at Lucies, and will require a very special family that can overlook my wobblyness.  Do you think that could be you?\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

Because of this,  she is a little shy and nervous at first but once she warms ups she is a love. It takes her a little longer to warm up to men than it does to women. By the way she acts, you would never know she is 10 years old. She loves to go on walks and run at the park. She also loves to play with her toys and the other dog in her foster home. Noodle is potty trained, spayed, chipped, and up to date on vaccinations. \n\nFor the quickest response please forward answers to the following questions to graciabutter@gmail.com\n\n\u2022 What city do you live in?\n\u2022 Do you rent or own?\n\u2022 Any children in the home? What ages?\n\u2022 What is your work schedule? Family schedule?\n\u2022 How many hours per day would the pet be left alone?\n\u2022 Any other pets in the home? If so, what type?\n\u2022 Provide detailed video of your fenced yard - entire perimeter including gates and the bottom of the fencing. The video needs to be up close like I am walking your fenceline myself. The yard must be free of foxtails and fully secured.\n\u2022 A home check may be performed\n\u2022 If \"meet & greet\" is scheduled, all household members, dogs included, must be present\n",

He came to us severely emaciated from a cruelty case. This big boi is currently settled into a loving foster home and is learning to 'dog' and loving every minute of it! He is a true hound of leisure and enjoys long naps in the sun, sniffing the air and curling up at his person's feet. He's great on a leash and easily controllable. He LOVES to play and is incredibly devoted to his 'person'. He howls with delight when he's happy like a true hound dog. He is both kennel and house-trained. Bones will require a securely fenced yard (hounds looooooove to roam given the opportunity). He is about 3 years old, UTD on all shots, neutered, HW negative and on both flea and HW prevention. He currently weighs about 46 pounds and could still stand to gain a few more. He'd do best in just about any home. He ADORS children and would love a family of his own to play with!\n\n*We are NOT a shelter. We are a foster-based rescue with NO facility. PLEASE take a moment to read more about who we are and what we do at Trampled Rose Rescue & Rehab HERE: \n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/la/ponchatoula/trampled-rose-rescue-rehab-la410/   \n\nIt outlines, in great detail, our adoption process, adoption fees, how we select forever homes and much more.\n\n*If you think you may be a good fit for one of our rescue dogs, PLEASE SUBMIT AN APPLICATION for consideration. Feel free to drop a line with any questions we haven't answered, however, ONLY SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AND PROCESSED. \n\n*If the dog is visible to you here on Petfinder, it is still available for adoption, so NO NEED to ask. The moment a home visit agreement is signed, the dog will be marked 'Adoption Pending' and, if all goes well, 'Adopted'. If the home visit was not a success, the dog will be relisted as 'Adoptable'. \n\n*We get DOZENS (and sometimes HUNDREDS) of messages via Petfinder, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, phone, text and email about EACH of our rescues EVERY DAY. We do the best we can to respond to them all, but ultimately there's just not enough hours in the day. If you're seriously interested in a dog, the best course of action is to submit an application and BE PATIENT. We DO go through EVERY application that we receive, on a first come first served basis, and will select the home BEST SUITED for that particular rescue. We almost exclusively deal with special needs dogs and there is an ideal lifestyle we have in mind for each of our rescues. If you DO NOT receive a call it DOES NOT mean you were forgotten or declined. We likely had a barrage of applicants before you and one of those was a clear winner. Please keep in mind, we all have full time jobs, families and fosters and permanent pets of our own, so PLEASE be patient and allow us ample time to do this volunteer work in what little free time we have. Thank you.\n\n*Applications are available on our main page here on Petfinder OR on our website, www.trampledroserescue.com/adopt. Thnx!\n",

While we hoped someone would come looking for her, no one ever did. At Jada's intake exam, we sadly discovered that she was heartworm positive and would require treatment. Jada has been undergoing the \"slow kill\" method of treatment for over a year while learning a lot in our FIDO prison program. She hopes to be heartworm free very soon. Jada does have some bladder issues and needs a daily medication to help with it. She can be a little shy meeting new people and takes some time to warm up, so because of this she would be best in a home without small children. Jada can picky with her canine friends and prefers a home without cats. This gorgeous gal is hoping that her new family will come soon and show her what it's like to be a valued family pet!\n\nJada is a member of our FIDO prison program.

This sweet boy sadly came to our shelter as a stray in March 2019. At his intake exam, we discovered that he was heartworm positive and would require treatment. Mario has been undergoing the \"slow kill\" method of treatment while learning a lot in our FIDO prison program. He hopes to be heartworm free very soon. Mario is a sweet boy who can be a little shy when meeting new people. He would prefer a calm, quiet home without small children and other animals. Mario loves to run and play, so a fenced yard is required in order to adopt him.\n\nMario is a member of our FIDO prison program. FIDO dogs are obedience trained and socialized by the prison inmates. The $150 adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, de-worming, microchip, and heart worm test (and current with monthly preventative). They are house trained, crate trained, and know their 5 basic commands. If interested in meeting a FIDO dog, please fill out an application online at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be contact with you.\n\nMario\nShepherd mix\nMale\nDOB: 3/29/2014\nWeight: 45 lbs.\nHeartworm Positive",

My people say I have the cutest curling tail and I kind of have a bassett hound walk\u2026my hips swish when I walk. My people say I am a hot mess\u2026whatever that means.  I am a total busy body but in a good way.  I am not a shy girl and I have never met a stranger.  If you are looking for someone to accompany you to work, I just might be your girl.  I was found wandering around a neighborhood with my best friend Boomer and there was no family in sight.  I have had puppies in the past but thank goodness those days are behind me. A nice lady took us in and could not understand how someone could throw such a pups.  She told us not to worry, better days were ahead and made a promise to find us a new extra special family.\n\nI am now looking for a new forever home.  I am looking forward to having a nice comfy bed to sleep in and I will need an abundance of toys and LOTS of treats!  After all\u2026I deserve it!  I am super sweet, smart and energetic.   I love to go on neighborhood walks and just be out and about.  If you want to relax, you should know I love to cuddle and have big dreams of being a lap dog.  I am friendly with new people and I do well with other dogs.    I have never been cat tested, so my new people are going to say no homes with furry felines.    \n\nI am house trained, crate trained, spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and healthy.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Beckham came to us via our rescue partners in Northern AZ. He was rescued and living in a temporary foster home before being transported to Paw Placement.\n\nHe was named by his previous foster family and we can only guess they chose this name due to his athleticism and endurance! This boy is very much a border collie - always on the go, wanting to play with the other dogs, chase a toy, and race around the yard - and he's working on learning to just chill out in his current foster home. He's currently lying on the rug, chewing an antler, having tired out every other dog playmate in the home long ago! Beckham is still very much a puppy in that he is active and hyper and a ball of energy. He is smart and eager to please, affectionate and aggressively snuggly, sweet and silly.\n\nBeckham most certainly needs a home with an equally active doggie playmate, or perhaps a very active owner, and one that understands/has experience with the drive of a working/herding breed. Beckham is not a dog for a first time dog owner, nor will he do well in a lazy household. Beckham loves to bike, run and hike, and he's great on a leash! Beckham is not appropriate for an apartment setting; he requires a house with a yard. He's a great medium size, and his hair is a mixture of soft, supple border collie and coarse husky - and he sheds similarly. He is crate and house trained in his foster home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application. Because we expect a large number of applications, and are still understaffed due to COVID19, we will only be able to email those applicants that are approved to schedule a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for your understanding if you don't hear back from us regarding your application.",

            "description": "Harrison is a handsome 5 year old Pittie mix with a huge heart to match his adorable big head. Harrison (or \"Harry\") gets along well with other large dogs but we feel a home with small animals is not a great fit for him due to a high prey drive. Harry loves to go for walks with you and cuddle on the couch all day. His favorite place to be is on a pile of soft pillows, blankies, you name it - he's snuggling on it. We think his \"beefy\" exterior is balanced by his soft, tender heart. Harrison is house trained and has been in a foster home for around five months while we worked on diagnosing chronic skin and GI issues. We have learned that Harry needs to be on a hypoallergenic food and has also benefitted from medication to control chronic skin allergies. Harry also prefers to be near his people and while he has been safe left home alone, he does vocalize at first, so apartment life might be not be for him. We would love to talk with you about Harrison and tell you more about his medical information and why he might make a great addition to your family! \n\nSince Harrison is in foster care, we ask that you please submit an adoption questionnaire via our website if you would like to meet him!",

He is a strong and solid dog who loves to play ball. He is full of tail wags for everyone he meets. \n\nHe knows the commands sit and down. He rides well in the car; he just curls up in the passenger seat. He\u2019s great on leashed walks as well. \n\nHe is housebroken and crate-trained. Bullwinkle is de-wormed, neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped, heartworm-tested and on monthly preventative. His adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. \n\nI first photographed this guy back in January of 2013 and he has been kenneled waiting for a loving home for over seven years! Isn\u2019t it time someone took a chance on him? He's looking for a home as the one and only pet.\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt him, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net or 708-224-1900. \n\nHe is currently being kenneled in Union, Illinois.",

Prospective adopters must be able to travel to San Antonio to complete the adoption process. Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\nCallie is a beautiful 2-year-old Great Dane. She was suffering from extreme neglect and malnourishment when she was rescued near the Texas/Mexico border. Her former owner cruelly housed Callie on a dirt lot and her only shelter from extreme Texas weather was a three-sided plywood box. Callie was tethered to a tall metal pole and she could only walk in endless circles around that pole. During violent thunder storms, Callie frequently faced death by electrocution from lightning strikes. She often was forced to drink dirty water from a 5-gallon bucket coated with slime. During the Texas summers where temperatures can exceed 100 degrees, Callie was at daily risk for heat stroke. In the winter months, Callie's malnourished body would shiver as she laid on the cold and damp dirt.\nDespite her heartbreaking history, Callie thrived in her new foster home where she shown kindness for the first time in her life. She loves human companionship and interacts nicely with the other dogs in her foster home. Not surprisingly, Callie is a little needy and wants nothing more than to be near a human. Accordingly, she will need to be kenneled when left alone at home.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for her entire life (up to 15+ years or more.)\n\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\n\nHer adoption fee is $300.

Bailey isn't used to being away from home but sadly, he is with us because he just didn't get along with the other dog in his home.  Bailey appears to be ok with some female dogs, but he'll need a home with no male dogs, cats, or young kids.  He's a nervous guy that takes a little bit to trust new people but once he does, he is your very best friend.  Bailey is an absolute love when he gets to know you.  He's well-behaved, housebroken, listens well, he's curious and outgoing, and he's an expert fetcher.  He warms up much quicker to women than to men, but in a patient and loving home, he'll be everyone's best buddy.  He just needs a chance.  File#29754  9/3/20\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Bailey.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter.

At this time she is scare of her shadow and we need to find her a home, a patient, quiet home where she can start to feel comfortable in her own skin. \n\nBrandy is good around other dogs but we would not recommend her for a busy, active home with lots of people or children.

She's good with dogs that are her size and larger (no small dogs). Come by and play with her in our big Main Campus play yard, take her for a walk, and find out how great this girl is. If you live an active lifestyle, this girl will be a good match for you!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOur goal is to have all adopted animals spayed/neutered, vaccinated (to include rabies), and micro-chipped. Completion of all these procedures at time of adoption will be dependent on the animal's age and intake date. Specifics will be identified within the adoption contract.",

I am currently in a foster home and not at HSNBA, so if you are interested in meeting me, please contact the nice folks at HSNBA so they can put you in contact with my foster family to set up a meet & greet! You can e-mail HSNBA at adoption@hsnba.org, call us at: (830) 629-5287 or stop by HSNBA at 3353 Morningside Dr. to get your information sent over to my foster home. My foster family is the best and can give you more information on me.\nJust so you know, I have tested heartworm positive. This means I have a parasite and need treatment. While my friends at HSNBA desperately want to help me, the shelter is too stressful an environment to undertake treatment and treatment itself is very expensive. The shelter has a few options to help with treatment, and if I steal your heart you should talk with them and your vet about what my treatment is like. For more information on heartworms, please visit the American Heartworm Society here https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nCan't wait to find my furever family!HSNBA lists all animals online from the moment of intake, and our listings are updated automatically every midnight. Some of these animals may not be available for adoption at this moment, but you can always call the shelter at 830-629-5287 for clarification on the adoption process or the animal's current status.",

If I see you sitting alone you bet that I am gonna come and snuggle into you until you start to pet me! I also LOVE to sleep next to my people! It is one of my favorite things to do! \n\nWhen it comes to other dogs, I do fine, just give me some time to get used to them and we'll be best of friends. When I get used to my new friends I LOVE playing with them. However, I would much rather be with my people! They are my top priority! \n\nHope to meet you soon!\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nLioness just completed Heartworm treatment and is waiting for a negative test result which can take 2-9 months after treatment. During these months, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Lioness is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The committment will be for an adoption but will be fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. Food, kennel, grooming and other supplies will be provided by the foster in the foster to adopt program. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

I COULD BE THE BEST PRESENT YOU WILL EVER GET AND YOU COULD BE THE BEST PRESENT I WILL EVER GET BY GIVING ME A PERMANENT FOREVER HOME. I AM 1/2 TO 3/4 GERMAN SHEPHERD AND 8 MONTHS OLD. I HAVE HAD ALL MY SHOTS AND FIXED AND READY TO GO FOR YOU. MY FOSTER PARENTS LOVE ME AND I HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS. WHEN I WAS LITTLE SOMEONE WAS NOT GOOD TO ME AND I AM BLIND IN ONE EYE. SO I AM A SPECIAL NEEDS DOG, YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT WITH ME. I NEED A WELL FENCED YARD AND LOTS OF LOVE AND ATTENTION. I LOVE EVERYONE AND EVERYBODY. GIVE ME A GOOD HOME AND I WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND. THANKS. TRUDY\n\nTrudy is a special pup. She is very friendly and loving and she likes for you to sit down so she can crawl in your lap. She wants to play with her foster siblings but they aren't really interested. We don't know Trudy's background, but she has some slight physical limitations. She can be walked on a harness but not with a collar. She is sensitive to anesthesia and she is blind in one eye so may startle easy when approached from that side. Other than that, Trudy is just a loving pup who needs a furever home.",

We are showing dogs and cats to prospective adopters, but only on the grounds outside our shelter. We will need appointment to show the animal and we will want to have social distancing of 6' while you are there and we are wearing masks. We are doing Zoom interviews to see inside of your home since we aren't going into homes for home visit. We do come to your home before finalizing adoption to check the security of your fence if you are adopting a dog. Our dogs are given much care and attention and we treat every medical need of animal once we take them in.\nMCHS is a limited intake adoption center. We are an all volunteer, non-profit organization. All of our animals are disease free, have been spayed/neutered and are up to date on shots. We charge a Dog adoption fee of $125 which includes a microchip. Our Cat adoption fee is $75.00. Most of our dogs will require a fenced yard. To fill out application, go to our website Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org, go to Adoption Info tab and click on Application. For more info, call 662-564-2900. I'm a young red coonhound mix who just needs a new family to love. The volunteers say that I'm calm and loveable. I do get a little nervous around small kids so best family for me would have older kids or adults. Come and see me soon by calling 662-564-2900 or E-mail DogsNCats11@gmail.com to make an appointment to meet me.\nAll our animals have been spayed or neutered and up to date on all preventives and shots and we are microchipped.

I am a very loyal pup and will always be by your side, laying at your feet, or cuddling with you. I'm also energetic and love to run! I would very much enjoy a yard or a family that is active and would like to go on lots of hikes or walks with me. One of my favorite places is the dog beach! You can let me off the leash too; I might wander a little but I will come back when I'm called! I get along well with my foster dog brothers and sister and new pups at the dog park, however I would be most happy being the only pup in the house or I might prefer a male dog brother in the house to a female dog. I also have done very well with my house training and love to please!",

She has come out of her shell, loves playing with other dogs, and knows that she can trust humans again! She was likely born feral, with no human interaction. She has learned to love life, and is looking for her forever family. She would be great with kids and other dogs.The first step in our adoption process is an application. Once that is received, we will contact you to make an appointment to meet the animal. \n\nAdoption Applications can be completed at www.WFAHS.org",

            "description": "Meet Karma!  She's an adult Pit Bull type girl, brought to us by Law Enforcement when her owner was arrested.  No one came for her, and Karma is in need of a new home.  Karma was quite distraught by her new housing situation, and it took some time for her to allow us to handle her.  She's slowly coming out of her shell, and while she is leery of strangers, she is showing us how playful she is!  Karma loves her walks, loves to play fetch, and is obsessed with our big jolly ball!  Any potential adopters for this pretty girl should be prepared to put in some time and allow her to get used to them before they make a commitment.  Although she seems to always be on guard, she would likely relax and show her wonderful self in a loving home environment.  She has been pretty non-reactive to most of our other dogs.  Karma would do best with an experienced owner. \n Come check out Karma and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nWe pre-screen adopters interested in the Pit Bull Terriers at Del Norte Animal Control, and an adoption application will be required from those interested in providing a fab furever home to Karma.  Please call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

She is a stunning Cane Corso girl we pulled from Detroit Animal Care and Control. She is unfortunately heartworm positive. She is currently undergoing treatment so she needs to live in a calm environment and cannot be allowed to run or get her heart rate up. Due to her heartworm she has not been around any other dogs yet, but her foster says she seems to be very excited to meet them. She also doesn't seem to be bothered by the cat in the house. However, she has not seen the cat face-to-face. We do learn towards her not being able to live with cats at this point. Her foster mom says she is still shy and doesn't like loud noises or fast movements. Hopefully as she gets more comfortable, she will get relax a little more.",

            "description": "Meet Charlie!  He's a large Yellow Lab type of guy, about 4 years old.  He's free spirited and independent.  Charlie's favorite things seem to be playing fetch & the water!  He was actually found at the river, and although he is micro-chipped, his owner did not come for him.  Charlie gets so excited for fetch, he doesn't notice the hand holding the ball, so would likely do best in a home with no small children.  Charlie is blind in his right eye, which may affect his depth perception.  Although he will sit, he doesn't seem to have had much training or discipline, so would do best with an experienced owner.  He's a high energy guy, and \"catch me if you can\" also seems to be a favorite game of his.  He needs a home where he can be kept secure.  He doesn't care for our other dogs, so may do best as your only buddy.  Charlie just loves being a dog.  He doesn't seem to care too much about affection, he just wants to run and have fun!  Charlie was adopted, but returned after an incident with a cat, he needs a home with no kitties.  His humans will also need to be mindful when Charlie meets new people, apparently he can be selective about who he trusts.  If you're looking for a big buddy who is always ready for fun, come out and meet Charlie! \n Come check out Charlie and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nPlease call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

My name is Dumplin', and I'm a 4 year old, mixed breed, bundle of joy! I was brought into MaxFund as a stray dog and I've been here, chillin', ever since!\n\nWhen I first came in, I was really confused and somewhat afraid, so I wasn't getting along with other dogs at all and I was very picky about the people I wanted to be with. Since my arrival, I've done some training with MaxFund humans to relax a bit and become more comfortable. I've really grown into my personality, and I am a fan favorite here! I'm super sweet and cuddly, but also energetic and I love to play whenever I can.\n\nI am a big girl, weighing in around 60lbs, and I don't quite know that I'm that big. I move my muscular body around all the time (for fun of course) but for this reason, I wouldn't be able to go to a home with kiddos under 10 years. I would also prefer to be the only animal in the home. I'm still not a huge fan of other dogs and people tell me I'd probably chase cats around. I just want all the dang attention!\n\nIf my cute photos haven't done enough, come on down to the dog shelter and let my smile charm you in person! Please call the dog shelter at 303.595.4917 to make an appointment. Just ask for Dumplin'!!\n\n\nMaxFund is a physical shelter located at 1005 Galapago St in Denver, Colorado.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a dog, please call 303-595-4917\nDue to Covid we are showing dogs by appointment only.\n\nThis PetFinder account is managed by volunteers, and the most up-to-date information is at the shelter.\nHow our adoption process works:\n1. You MUST come into the shelter to meet a dog you are interested in (and meet a few others, while you\u2019re at it!)\n               \n                Our hours are 10-5 Mon, Wed, Thu Fri / 11-5 Saturday / 12-5 Sunday\n\n                We suggest you call ahead to be sure the dog(s) do not have pending applications\n2. You will fill out your adoption application, including references, after finding a dog you\u2019d like to adopt\n3. The application review and reference checks will take up to 3-5 business days; you will not be able to bring a dog home same-day\n                We only take 2 applications per dog, before they are unavailable. This is why we suggest you call ahead to check the status of the pup!\n \nWe do not adopt out-of-state.\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

Cage trained and almost potty trained. Highly recommend an active lifestyle or another high energy pup in the household.

            "description": "Raven weighs 72lbs, but she's on the skinny side and probably needs at least 5 - 10 more. We believe she is a Cane Corso mix, with something smaller (perhaps Boxer?). She has natural ears and a docked tail, which she loves to wag wag waggle at you! She adores all people and is incredibly tolerant of being loved on (as you can see!). She likes to explore and investigate, followed up by some serious naps, hah. Raven is very very good with dogs that are about medium sized or bigger. She loves Poe Poe, our American Bully, who is about 50lbs. I would not place her with cats or dogs that are much smaller than Poe, as she does have some serious prey drive and likes to chase smaller animals.\n\nRaven is house trained and crate trained, but she really doesn't need to be crated as she's completely non-destructive. No food aggression or resource guarding issues; apart from her prey drive, she is super laid back and go with the flow. She does have pretty bad arthritis, so she's no hiking buddy, but I think she'd love some gentle daily walks so she can see the sights. She is about 10 - 11 years old, which is pretty on up there for a Mastiff-type breed, but she's still got life left and items to check off her bucket list!\n\nIf you think you could be the perfect home for Raven, please visit OldDogHomeGA.com to fill out an application! We will continue maintaining her veterinary care until she is more stable, but she could go home on a foster-to-adopt at any time.",

This girl loves belly and head rubs and they put her right to sleep.  She is shy around men.  She would do best in a home with a female human and a patient friendly dog.  She was found as a stray after being dumped pregnant and ready to give birth.  She is ready to find a loving forever home.\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

He recently had hip surgery and is all healed up and moving around perfectly! Ronnie is a special boy that is playful with people and with other dogs, but is food aggressive and has bitten in these circumstances and out of fear Ronnie also gets too excited when playing so can be nippy with ankles when playing, so he needs to be in an adult only home and given lots of structure and boundaries. He is currently working on house training and does well when he is placed on a schedule and taken out frequently. Ronnie loves attention and will be a great companion with someone who has patience, can provide structure and has a calm environment with not too many guests to the home.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.
