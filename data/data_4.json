Overall Sissy is in good health with no concerns.\n\nBehaviorally, Sissy is a friendly girl who enjoys everyone who comes offering attention and love.  Her past is a mystery, and while she has shown no concerning behavior whatsoever, she does take slightly longer to warm up to men. Once warming up, she loves them just the same. Sissy has shown to thrive in a pack & would do best living with another dog to help her remain confident and outgoing. She is just barely 1 year old & is polishing all her indoor manners and doing wonderfully.  She does great in the bath and loves rides in the car.  Overall Sissy is a great family dog in the making and she is patiently waiting for that family to find her!\n\nApply for Sissy directly at the link below!\n\nhttps://pitofoursoulsrescue.com/our-dogs/adoption-application/",

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nRosalind is an approximately 12 week old female Jack Russell (?) Mix who we believe should stay around the small side of the \"medium\" category. Unfortunately we don't know either parent so we can't say for sure what breed mix they are and ultimately what size they will be but this is our best guess. Rosalind and her littermates were rescued from a Kentucky shelter when their time was up. Her adoption fee is $399 and includes her spay, vaccinations, microchip and routine labwork. Please email us to start the adoption process.\n\nFor puppies 6 months and younger you must live within 50 miles of Oswego, IL.\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes: \n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*: \n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming \n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old) \n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process. All adults in the household must be present and co-sign the application.",

My ID number is 336261\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter for more information.\n\nMeet Turbo! Now this is a face, everyone will LOVE! Not only is Turbo quite photogenic, he has a fantastic personality! Turbo is a happy boy, who is exuberant and always ready to go...no matter what that means. When meeting his canine shelter friends, Turbo, did well. He is currently working on learning spacial awareness, and making progress! This stud would appreciate an active owner, one willing to continue working with him, keeping him busy and engaged. If you simply cannot resist this mug...come and meet handsome, Turbo!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336510 (female), and 336498 (male). Did very well with both. Did not back down from other male who was displaying unwanted behavior, but was not reactive. He is a strong, high energy dog. He has a very nice personality, and he talks and howls for attention 1/19/2021\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** Primary Color: Red Secondary Color: Brown Weight: 72lbs Age: 5yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

Once he is asleep don\u2019t bother him or you will get a warning growl or he will get up and bark at you; no one likes to have their nap disturbed!  He loves hanging out with his people and just relaxing on the couch \u2013 no kids under 15 though.\n\nHe likes gentle walks but isn\u2019t the best on leash - if he decides he has had enough he whips around and chews through his collar/ harness to be free from the nonsense. He likes to wander so a secure back yard and sometimes even a travel crate in the car is a must to avoid chasing him around the neighborhood.   He is an old man with a mind of his own and wants things on his terms.\n\nHe is not the biggest fan of the crate his foster family has tried getting him to call home while they are at the store and he likes to defend the house from deliveries and trash trucks so apartment living might be overwhelming for him. Shredder knows to warn you to let him outside but sometimes he gets so excited he pees where he is standing. He loves sunbathing and even sits outside protecting his backyard with a jacket on in the snow. \n\nShredder tolerates other dogs but doesn\u2019t want to play with them. If they get too much in his face he will warning snap at then. He has trained his foster brother huskies to abandon the chair if it is where he wants to be sleeping. He likely will do fine with a cat that just leaves him alone.\n\nShredder recently got his teeth cleaned and they are in good shape, he has some alopecia but tolerates grooming well, and he is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on his vaccinations. He will make a great addition to a calm environment who doesn\u2019t mind a little Pomeranian sass every once and a while. \n",

            "description": "Bonnie\u2019s sad story has become a happy story!  This beautiful sweet girl will have a wonderful life from now on.  She is only one year old and happy and healthy.  She is spayed and current on all her vaccinations and is heartworm negative.  Many JRTs are very bouncy!!  But, Bonnie is not that way.  She is more the cuddle bug type.  Her two favorite dogs in her foster home are a 13 year old male JRT and a 6 month old mixed breed puppy.  Bonnie can be a little bit dog selective...she likes some male dogs, but not female dogs and no cats or kiddos (kids make her too nervous)  Her house manners are great.  Sleeping with you is what she really wants to do, but can go in her crate even though she does not like it.  Bonnie is small.  Her weight is about 12-13 pounds so she is very petite.  She likes to snoop around in the yard and hunt for bunnies and lizards.  Barking at squirrels is also fun.  Going for walks is fine too as long as it is not too far.  Her legs are short.  If you want a jogging/walking/biking/hiking partner she is probably not the girl for you.  All in all, Bonnie is a little moonbeam of a dog.  In order to adopt her you must be comfortable with someone coming to your home for a visit.  You also need a good vet  reference.  Your fence needs to be very secure.  No wrought iron.  No electronic fencing.  Bonnie was picked up stray once already, so we want to make sure her forever home has a fence that can contain her.  Her adoption fee is $275.  Please fill out the online application on www.RussellRescue.com  Her adopter must be able to drive to the San Antonio/Seguin, Texas area to get her.

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nMullis is an approximately 12 week old male Jack Russell (?) Mix who we believe should stay around the small side of the \"medium\" category as an adult. Unfortunately we don't know either parent so we can't say for sure what breed mix they are and ultimately what size they will be but this is our best guess. Mullis and his littermates were rescued from a Kentucky shelter when their time was up. His adoption fee is $399 and includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and routine labwork. Please email us to start the adoption process.\n\nFor puppies 6 months and younger you must live within 50 miles of Oswego, IL.\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes: \n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*: \n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming \n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old) \n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process. All adults in the household must be present and co-sign the application.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: \n*Age: \n*Current Weight: \n*Rescued from: \n*Adoption fee: $375 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines\n\n______ was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. He/She will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on ______ ready for adoption! To apply to adopt _______, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

The pups were approximately 6 weeks of age when they came to us. (A picture of her mom is also included.)\n\nTriscuit is going to make someone a great companion because she has such a great personality. She loves to play with pups and people, finds interest in most things and displays a high level of intelligence.\n\nTriscuit has now received all three of her first year puppy vaccines, de-wormed and treated against parasites. She'll be receiving her bordetella and rabies vaccinations prior to her adoption. Triscuit's adopter must agree to having her spay by the time she reaches 6 months of age and supply verification of such to our rescue. She will also require all of her basic training.",

Inquiries do not reach us.\n\nMeet Willow: \n2.5-year-old Female Blue Heeler, Spayed, 40 lbs.\n\nWillow is a very gentle, sweet, happy Australian Cattle Dog (blue) that is not going to tell anyone about\nher start in life. It is something that she chooses to forget now that she has learned that life can be fun,\nsafe, and people can be trusted. She is microchipped, crate trained (she loves to \u2018crate up\u2019), housebroken,\nand knows \u2018touch\u2019 for games and treats.\n\nWillow loves to \u2018go sit on her bed\u2019, loves to \u2018find it\u2019 referring to treat games to give some fun things to do\ninside. Willow learns quickly and happily. She is a \u201cVelcro girl\u201d, so her recall is quite good, as she is never\nmore than a few feet away. Her favorite place to be is right by her foster Mom\u2019s side! She also loves her\nmorning and afternoon naps. Willow loves belly rubs, soft pats and gentle touches. She is curious and\nwilling to try new things all the time. She is learning to catch treats in her mouth and is enjoying\nmastering that skill.\n\nShe will need a very patient forever home that will allow Willow the time she needs, possibly several\nweeks, to let her truly brave self to come out and trust her new people. This is so important for her \u2013 only\non Willow\u2019s terms and very slowly, the trust will happen as she observes and gets used to her new\nenvironment and new people.\n\nShe would love a home where she can be with her person 24/7- that is ideal for this lovely girl! Willow\ndoes much better with women than men (please, no all-male homes for her). With patience and time, she\ncame to trust her foster Dad, but only since he was willing to let Willow decide when it would happen.\nNow they are good buddies!\n\nWillow would do best in a quiet country setting, without children. Fast movements, even by her trusted\npeople, can still be scary, but she is so happy and wants to have fun, and recovers nicely now. City streets,\ncars, lots of people and strange sounds are not for this girl, so a quieter setting with a fenced yard would\nbe ideal for Willow.\n\nShe was Heartworm (HW) positive when she came into foster care with ACDRA and has been fully treated.\nHer activity is still limited until her next HW test in April. She loves her leashed walks/hikes and is very\ngood on leash. She is up to date on vaccines and HW preventive.\n\nShe has been low to medium energy here at her foster home, but as she moves through her heartworm\nlimited activity period, she seems to want to run and play more (though not allowed until she slowly gets\nback to normal activity once she receives a HW negative test), so classifying her as medium energy seems\nbest. She is quite interested in the deer on the other side of the fence, so medium prey drive also. She\nwould likely do well as an only dog, or have a respectful, low to medium energy dog friend. She does not\nenjoy high energy dogs at all. She has not been around cats, but we feel that she may chase them. \n\nWillow is looking for her perfect forever home where she can be given the chance to grow on her own\nterms - slowly. Then the sky is the limit for this beautiful young girl as she embarks on her best life and is\nallowed to become a truly happy, trusting, funny, companion, and family member!\n\nWillow is being fostered in Clinton, NJ.\nHer foster Mom can be reached at: heelersarethestorm@gmail.com.\n\nCOMPLETE AN APPLICATION\nhttp://www.acdra.org/adoption-application\n\n\n",

Mom is a Vizsla/Pocket Pit mix and dad is unknown. Based on their markings our best guess for dad would be a German Shepherd, possibly boxer mix.\n\nPURPLE AND ORANGE ARE PENDING\nThe way our adoption process works: You would submit an application for a puppy. Once approved to adopt a meet and greet would be scheduled to pick the puppy that is the best fit for your family. A $100 deposit would be put down to hold the puppy until adoption. That fee would be included in the total adoption fee.\n\nPlease note there will be a large number of applications coming in for the puppies so we will choose the best fit based on the approved applications received.\n\n100% of every adoption fee is used to rescue and care for homeless animals. Please consider donating to help us more rescue animals.\n2/2/21 3:04 PM",

He got out of the shelter around Christmas and went to wonderful fosters of ours who have 4 other dogs if their own. He gets along well with all and has had no issues. He is described by the foster as very calm, sweet and laid back. He\u2019s not your typical full of energy lab. He does play and would be a great walking companion but doesn\u2019t need a high energy household. \n\nJingle is house and crate trained. He is not a huge fan of the crate but will go in it. He is shy around strangers and takes a bit to warm up before getting used of them. He would be fine as an only dog or with a calmer more laid back dog that doesn\u2019t want to play with him non-stop. He has also been around the fosters young grand children. \n\nJingle is up to date on all shots, recently neutered and micro-chipped. He is current on monthly flea, tick and heartworm prevention. He is available locally for meet and greets. He can also be adopted out of state- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee.",

IF THEY ARE POSTED, THEY ARE AVAILABLE \u2014 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SETTING UP A MEET AND GREET, SUBMIT AN APPLICATION THECANTUFOUNDATION.ORG ]\n\nIt\u2019s your new homie: Romy!\nHi! I\u2019m Romy! I\u2019m seven months old and I\u2019m a female German shepherd mix. I\u2019m fully vaccinated AND I\u2019m spayed, so all my medical needs are taken care of! I\u2019m pretty small: only 26 pounds! I\u2019m smart, too. I\u2019m already potty trained and I know how to walk on a leash! I can be a little timid when I go for walks, but I do well despite that. I\u2019m not crate trained though.\nI was rescued with my sister, Michelle, in Mexico. We were part of an extremely friendly pack of dogs! As you can probably guess, I\u2019m friendly with dogs of any size. I\u2019m currently being fostered in a home with three other dogs, and we all get along! I\u2019m not sure if I get along with cats or kids yet though, because I haven\u2019t met either one yet. But maybe we can give it a try!\nMy foster momma says I\u2019m the perfect little girl. She says I\u2019m so gentle and calm; I\u2019m the sweetest pup and I love to cuddle; it\u2019s my favorite thing in the world! I also love to play and nibble on toys. If my foster momma could describe me in three words they would be \u201csweet,\u201d \u201ccalm,\u201d and \u201cloveable.\u201d My ideal home would have another dog that I can romp around in the yard with. I love to have company. I don\u2019t show any signs of separation anxiety, so I\u2019ll be fine with my owner coming and going, but I\u2019m used to always having another canine companion with me. I\u2019m pretty much the perfect dog, if I do say so myself! If you think I sound like a good fit for your family, you can apply to adopt me at http://www.thecantufoundation.org/adopt.html. My adoption fee is $500. I can\u2019t wait to meet you!",

I've got short little legs that would happily walk me into your new home! I'm a super social guy and enjoy the company of both dogs and people. Side note, I really enjoy snacks! I have a fantastic happy dance I do when I first meet people or sometimes when I'm out on a walk I do it too. Call the shelter today to schedule an appointment to meet me!\n",

Ester came to Fuzzy Pawz Rescue when her family could no longer care for her. She had one of the worst cases of Cherry Eye we had ever seen; 3 surgeries later she is finally better! She doesn\u2019t have full site and is a bit deaf but she is one healthy and happy girl.\n\n\nThis gentle giant has become a BIG part of her foster family! Ester has put up with teens running in/out of the house, sharing with the other dogs and a cat and all manner of chaos. She has helped with watering (drool) the house plants, mopping the floors (drool and fluff) and contributing (dog hair) to the vacuum. \n\n\nShe's great to snuggle with while reading or watching television \u2013 and will do anything for a belly rub. She is a calm, good-natured dog but can get playful at times \u2013 so it\u2019s nice if she has easy access to a yard with space to move or just to stretch out in. Because she has no idea how big she is - she can be a bit much for small children accidentally knocking them over or to be honest she can knock over a full grown adult. Be warned she gets crazy puppy antics when you come home for the day (it is delightful!)\n\n\nShe\u2019s not going to be a jogging companion but loves to take a stroll around the neighborhood and is a big fan of car rides. \n\n\nShe is house-trained, know basic commands, good on a leash, does not bark unless there is a reason to. Ester would be a great choice for the person or family who would like a large but gentle loving dog. Due to her size no kids in her home under the age of 10.\n\n",

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nEinstein is an approximately 12 week old male Jack Russell (?) Mix who we believe should stay under 25 lbs as an adult. He is the smallest pup in this litter. Einstein has a short naturally docked tail. Unfortunately we don't know either parent so we can't say for sure what breed mix they are and ultimately what size they will be but this is our best guess.

Martini is around 10 pounds and is ready to start his potty and obedience training. His hobbies are wrestling with his mom, eating, making mischief, and being adorable. \n\nThis puppy is neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.\n\nThe adoption fee is $550 if your adoption is prepaid prior to your pup's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on puppies that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\n\nIf you are an MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at the Woburn MA isolation facility. Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm - 2pm. An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05.\n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO www.cprdogs.com. If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation. \n\nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling! If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

I'm looking for someone to snuggle with me and to pet me and love me alllllllll dayyyyyyy!! Then we can go on a nice relaxing walk, at amble speed (that's my favorite speed), and just sniff the world together! I really enjoy laying around outside so if you have a nice porch or some land for me to hang out on I'd really love that too! If I sound like the perfect dog, call the humane society to take me home today!\n",

When she came to us, she was obese at 15 pounds, but we've been able to get her to lose a few pounds. She could still lose a couple of pounds, but she's feeling much better. Paris is very sweet and loving. She walks well on leash and travels well in the car. She does good with pottying outside as long as you take her out regularly. Paris is a beautiful chocolate pom. She had been shaved when we got her, but her hair is growing back and getting long again. Paris is spayed, microchipped, and had a dental. Her shots have been updated and she's heartworm negative. Paris is ready to find her forever home.\n\nIn order to adopt, you need to send an e-mail to rescue@secondchancepoms.org asking for an application.  After you send this back, we will check references and someone will visit you in your home to discuss adoption.  We ask a donation of $425 for adults, which includes an applicable Texas sales tax, and $475 for puppies, which includes an applicable Texas sales tax.  This covers shots, spay/neuter, and any medical treatment, such as de-worming. We do not ship our pomeranians, but an out-of-state adoption can still happen if the adopter comes to the Houston, TX area to pick up their pom.",

The pups were approximately 6 weeks of age when they came to us. (A picture of her mom is also included.)\n\nWith her stunning markings, Toccoa is an exceptionally beautiful girl. But rest assured her beauty is much more than \"skin-deep\" as it's her true inner beauty that will amaze you. Adopt Toccoa and be ready to hear often the words \"Oh my, what a beautiful girl!\"\n\nToccoa has now received all three of her first year puppy vaccines, de-wormed and treated against parasites. She'll be receiving her bordetella and rabies vaccinations prior to her adoption. Toccoa's adopter must agree to having her spay by the time she reaches 6 months of age and supply verification of such to our rescue. She will also require all of her basic training.",

            "description": "Looking for a handsome, sweet and loving boy to add to your family? Then check out Chance (aka Buddy)! He is a Doberman mix probably around 3-4 years old but still acts like a clumsy, goofy puppy with his long legs. He was found as a stray clearly not well cared for, but now he is living in a loving foster home learning all kinds of new things about how to be a well-balanced pup. He loves to play and run around in the yard but also can kick back and relax next to you on the couch for hours. His foster family says he is a true diamond in the rough! Everything was new to Chance... walking on a leash, potty training, riding in the car, basic commands, you name it. But he is a fast learner and really wants to please his humans so he is learning very quickly what it's like to be a loving, respectful member of the family. He will require an owner with patience that will continue his training and keep him active both physically and mentally. Although Chance currently lives with other dogs, we feel his ideal home will have no other dogs or small kids since he is such a big boy and still working on his boundaries. This stunning dog has so much potential and will make an incredible best buddy for the right human(s). If you want to take a chance on Chance, get your application in today!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet checkClick here to watch a video of Chance.",

He may only weigh 24 pounds, but this little Napoleon fears nothing and is ready to take on the world. Just think of him as your pint-sized protector! Dash can be somewhat selective with other dogs, and tends to prefer respectful female dogs that will let him be in charge. He would also be perfectly happy as an \"only child\" if you're just looking for one dog to spoil. Either way, if you enjoy a spunky lap dog, consider adopting Dash!\n\nWe are located at 8172 Washington Church Road, Washington Township, Ohio 45458 and are open Monday-Saturday, noon-7pm and Sunday, noon-6pm. To schedule an appointment, you can reach us during our open hours at 937-294-6505.",

There is no facility to visit.\u00a0\n\n\n**We are asking for a home with German Shepherd experience for Klink**\nKlink is a very sweet boy who is ready for a family of his own.  He would love a home with a fenced yard where he can run and play whenever he wants.  His leash manners are lacking so he will need a person who is strong and ready to teach him what's expected while out on walks.  \n\nKlink loves people of all ages but, because of his size, we are asking for home without children under 12.  This big boy wants to be the only pet in the home where he can soak up all the love and affection that his people have to give.  A home with no other dogs and no cats will be required.\n\nKlink was recently neutered and has an eyelid margin mass removed.  He is doing great and ready to go home.  Klink is 10 years old and weighs 119 pounds.\n\nAdoption fee is $150.00 + $100.00 refundable training deposit to be refunded upon completion of training course.\nSave-A-Mutt is a registered 501c3.\n\nPlease note, we have approximately a 300 mile adoption radius. We don\u2019t ship dogs.  Once approved you must pick them up in Snohomish County, WA\u00a0*Due to the Border Closure to Canada - we are currently not accepting Canadian Adoption Applications*. Sorry.\n",

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nCrick is an approximately 12 week old male Jack Russell (?) Mix who we believe may be slightly larger than his brothers as an adult, but will likely be on the small end of \"medium\" category. Unfortunately we don't know either parent so we can't say for sure what breed mix they are and ultimately what size they will be but this is our best guess. Crick and his littermates were rescued from a Kentucky shelter when their time was up. His adoption fee is $399 and includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and routine labwork. Please email us to start the adoption process.\n\nFor puppies 6 months and younger you must live within 50 miles of Oswego, IL.\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes: \n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*: \n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming \n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old) \n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process. All adults in the household must be present and co-sign the application.",

We do not know what her breeds are, just that she is sweet natured. \n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425 with $100 refundable deposit added.  This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

He is also working on his house training, but with the cold weather he gets cold pretty fast and wants to come back in sooner then he normally would. \nWhen Rambo came to us he was pretty skinny and had bald patches on his head caused by Demodectic Mange. Mange usually occurs in animals with immature immune system and it allows for an overgrowth of the normal mites on the skin. This can causes bald patches and flakey skin. Mange can be contagious to other dogs with compromised immune systems. Rambo is currently being treated and his hair and skin are looking much better. It will take at least 3 months for the Mange to be under control. Mange is not contagious to people or healthy animals.\nRambo's ideal home according to him would have another dog to play with and a family that loves to play fetch and snuggle. When it comes to kids, Rambo would be happy with bigger kids to play with. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions about Rambo.",

Franz is people-oriented. He will make you laugh and feel good and fill your Life with Joy. As an adult we foresee he will present a commanding presence!\n<br>\nFranz and his siblings were born around December 9th to a smaller-sized (approx 40-45 lbs) Labrador Retriever mix mother and a Catahoula father. The puppies were left behind when their elderly owner was hospitalized. His granddaughter rescued the puppies to find them good homes. Franz came to us in a good condition. He received his first set of puppy vaccinations and dewormer. On 02/2, Franz weighed 7.5-lbs.\n<br>\nFranz is looking for his Fur-ever home - Is That YOU?   \nEMAIL us for more information about the adoption process and to SCHEDULE a time to meet this Handsome Boy!\nThank you for seeking to adopt a rescued dog! :)\n\n",

I have incredibly soft fur and I love to snuggle. I'm a little bit shy, but I warm up quickly. I'm a pretty quiet girl and I watch before deciding to do anything. I love food and treats so I should catch on to training pretty fast. I'm doing fantastic with kennel training and going potty outside. I'm about 12 weeks old and weigh 15 lbs give or take. I will be spayed and fully vetted on 2/3, so I will be ready to go to my forever home a few days later.

            "description": "MEET TYSON!! This handsome 90 pound guy is Tyson! Tyson is a 5-year-old neutered male pit bull mix who came to us when his owner passed away. This friendly goofball is looking for an active home that can provide him with plenty of exercise, as he could benefit from losing a few pounds :) He is strong and can play a little rough sometimes so ideally he would need an experienced dog owner and to go to a teen/adult only home. He could potentially go home to another dog that can handle his high energy self. He would prefer to not live with cats though. He loves running around our yard and rolling around for belly rubs! If you think you are this friendly guy's forever home please fill out the adoption inquiry form for our Boston location below! This animal is currently up to date on all vaccinations, has been neutered, microchipped and been seen by our vet team. If you are interested in adopting this animal, please fill out our web form, available here: Boston Adoption Interest Form You can expect a response to your inquiry from a member of our adoption staff within 48 hours of completing this form. Due to our high volume of inquiries, please refrain from calling unless that time frame has passed. If needed, you can reach the Boston shelter at 617-426-9170 x604. The Animal Rescue League of Boston is currently operating by appointment only Tuesday-Sunday 1pm-6pm. Our Adoption Forward process will start with a phone conversation. Also, be sure to check out our: * ARL Website * ARL Twitter * ARL Facebook * ARL Instagram",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

Lucky for me, I already have a ton of interested families, so consider me taken! I'm sorry to disappoint you. Please do not request an appointment to meet me. Because of my popularity, the shelter may not be able to call you back and your appointment may be cancelled. Please keep looking at the VCAS website for other adoptable dogs/cats!! I have made lots of friends here and they all deserve a loving home just like yours!",

He knows how to sit on cue but is not consistent. Archer has lived with children and other dogs. He appears to be a happy and silly boy and has been to the dog park. A meet and greet is recommended if you have another dog at home. We don't recommend you take him to the dog park until you are familiar with each other. He does tend to dig, when allowed, and likes to chew. Please provide him with the appropriate chew toys and don't leave him unattended in your yard. He is reported to be housebroken and used to using a doggie door. He came in with 1156770 Lana as a surrender due to becoming homeless.",

He acts submissive when he is startled by loud noises or voices. Joe is treat motivated and eager to show you what a good boy he has become. He has a lot of energy that would work great in a home where the owners include him in outdoor activities like hiking, jogging, etc. He seems eager and receptive in meeting other dogs and a meet and greet is recommended if you have another dog at home.

A few other words that our staff have used in describing him...energetic, green, smart and nice. \n\nAlthough raised in a home from 8 weeks old, he grew and grew in size and energy and his owners felt like he would have a better life if he had people that could give him the activity and attention he craves. He still has a lot of puppy in him and he is just learning how to learn, so he is looking for a partner or family who can help him grow up and become a well-mannered nice boy instead of an unruly wild child. He has all the qualities needed for the former, but runs the risk of remaining the latter, if left to his own devices. \n\nOur handlers have been working with him from the ground up, since he didn't come to us with any discernable skills--he is smart and he wants to please and if he is able to continue on with training and obedience, he has the potential to be a very nice dog indeed.\n\nHe is pleased with people and can be very friendly and playful, but with dogs he can be over-zealous in his excitement. He will need some help with proper canine social skills because he has none at this point in his young life.\n\nDuke was disqualified from continuing on in our search dog training program because of indications of elbow dysplasia on his x-rays. The search work that our dogs train for requires lots of high-impact physical activity (jumping up and down from heights, running on uneven surfaces, lateral moves and other activities hard on joints). He shows no outward signs and other than limiting high impact activities, he would benefit from lots of physical activity such as hiking, walking, swimming, toy play and any low-impact dog sport.\n\nThis big sweet goof is always looking for a good time and wants to have it with you!\n\nDuke is 1 year and 2 months old and weighs 68 pounds. He is neutered and up to date on vaccinations.",

            "description": "lf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire (http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/) and e-mail questions to Lauren at htar.lauren@gmail.com\n\nEffective March 18, 2020 all animals available for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. Our Adoption Center public hours are suspended until further notice. Cats dwelling at Crumbs & Whiskers can be met by approved adopters only by appointment. Please submit an online application and an adoption coordinator will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience and we hope to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nSirius is a very special lab that grew up on a meat farm in South Korea. When he came to us, he was shut down, would not make eye contact, and would not leave his crate. With the tireless work of his amazing foster, he has blossomed and come so far. That being said, he will still require a very special and patient home that understands he may regress some but are willing to continue to work with him on his confidence. \n\nSirius requires a home with another confident dog and a fenced in yard. No apartments/no urban settings. \n\nThings to know about Sirius: \n1- He is pee pad trained and also housetrained. He will probably need a few days to decompress before he is ready to go outside. However, he doesn't tell you when he needs to go so he still needs to be taken out every few hours. \n2- He is crate trained \n3- He is not fully leash trained but after a gentle tug, he will walk with you for a short distance. It is preferred that he goes to a home with a fence. \n4- He has zero aggression and loves to cuddle and play at night. \n5- He is great with kids and other dogs.\n6- He gets scared of loud noises but if you introduce things to him slowly he will adapt very quickly. \n7- He is not picky with food. He loves chew toys.\n8- He does not bark unless he is playing (rarely). \n9- He doesn't mind being groomed. (Bath, brush, and nail clipped) \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Lauren T\nLocation: Foster Home\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee DOES INCLUDE spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide a 30-minute phone consult with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert advice and guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program/",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nHis names explains it all! \n\nHappy is an active, and friendly 1 year old lab mix. \n\nThis goofy boy loves to make dog and people friends! He would be a wonderful adventure, and hiking parter. Happy boy is searching for his forever companion! He is house and kennel trained.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

Thanks for your understanding!\n\nBonnie is a sweet and playful German Shepherd puppy looking for her forever home. She was surrendered by an owner who could not handle her. She is 5.5 months old. Bonnie needs a home with no kids or only kids 12 and up, as she nips playfully pretty hard and is still working on manners. She does excellent in doggie daycare and plays very well with the other dogs, taking corrections nicely. She would benefit from a home with shepherd experience who would be interested in pursuing training for her and continue to keep her active and socialized. Bonnie's adoption fee is $429 and includes her spay, microchip, vaccinations and routine labwork. Please email us to start the adoption process.\n\nFor adoptions of puppies 6 months old and younger, you must reside within 50 miles of Oswego, IL\n\n\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599.

We have found that she is much happier in the company of men \u2013 she\u2019s fine with women but gravitates to men.  She would not do well with kids under 15 and would prefer to have a quieter lifestyle.\n\nShe enjoys napping on the couch with her person; slow walks around the block and playing with her Frisbee or a ball.   She is house trained and will also use a dog door and has great house manners. She doesn\u2019t care for car rides but tolerates them since most trips are going to the park for a walk. She is afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms but deals with them better now as she has gotten older.\n\nPatches is okay with other dogs, she has lived with one successfully in the past; however while in foster care we have found that she can be a bit grumpy around other dogs.  Patches will also chase cats.  Honestly we believe she would prefer to be the only dog or to live with a submissive male.\n\nAt her age it is not surprising that she has a bit of arthritis in her senior years; but she still likes to get up and go \u2013 it\u2019s just a bit slower now. Patches does have a food sensitivity and needs to eat special dog food, if not on the specialized food she gets ear infections.  She is eating Hills Z/D dry dog food and Iams lamb & rice pate from a can.\n\nIf you are looking for a sweet and very loyal dog then Patches will be just the right fit.\n\n\n\n",

Being from TX, you think the snow would be a bother, but the only thing that keeps me from going on longer walks is my chilly paws; I may need to get used to booties!\n\nAt 15 pounds, I fit perfectly on most laps, so I hope you don't mind. Docs think I'm 7 years old, so I'm young enough to appreciate long walks AND long naps.\n\nWe should start our relationship with total honesty; I was an owner surrender due to a biting incident, but I've been on my best behavior since arriving in Minnesota. Slow introductions are important, but a household with small children may not be the best option.\n\nI've had some accidents in the house, but that could be the result of a few different factors, so my fosters are cutting me some slack.\n\nI sleep all the way through the night once I've done the required 5 minutes of spinning and arranging of blankets in my crate.\n\nI've only been at my fosters for a couple days, but my tail is already wagging and I'm playing with my foster brother, so I think I'll get along okay with other dogs, but I'm not sure about cats. I also have mixed feelings about my tail. I chase it, but its curliness has made it very elusive.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website,\n\nwww.ruffstartrescue.org\n\nfor more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies:\n\nhttp://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

I was picked up as a stray and spent some time at the pound, then these great people got me out of there! They put me in a home with a mommy and canine siblings. I get along with all of them, big and small. I am young, strong, and playful. My foster mommy is helping me learn to mind my manners. Sometimes I just get so happy and excited, I jump on people. For this reason I probably shouldn't be with small children whom I might knock over, but I would be fine with older kids. When I work off my excess energy, I love to snuggle. My foster mom says I am an \"awesome\" boy!\n\nIf interested, you can easily fill out an adoption application by clicking here:\n\nadoption application\n\nFor anyone viewing this on Petfinder, if you are interested in adopting this animal you will need to go to our website www.rosesrescue.net to fill out the online adoption application. You can usually find more pictures of the animals there too. Click on our name \"Roses Rescue\" in blue above to be taken directly to our website.",

            "description": "I'm Nevada! It's nice to meet you! My siblings and I journeyed from the South to MN when we were just teeny tiny. Boy is it cold here!\n\nI'm less rough and tumble than my siblings; I'm a bit shy so I might step back and remove myself from the chaos. I tend to tremble with new people and situations, but I warm up and am just as sweet as can be. My foster mama is always telling me how darling and sweet I am. Would you like to be mine?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $525\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

My siblings and I were turned into animal control because our previous owner stopped feeding us. We were kept in a dirt lot and were slowly withering away. lucky for us, a good samaritan called animal control to report us. The bad news is that because we were in such poor body condition, we were immediately placed on the euthanasia list. Luckily our rescuers came just in time to save us! Now that we have gotten up t a healthy weight, and have gotten the green light from the vet, we are ready to meet you! \n\nMy foster parents call me Daffy! I am the sweetest girl you will ever meet. All I want s to be snuggled and pet by my humans! I am a happy pup who would be more than comfortable spending our days relaxing on the couch and sleeping in front of the fire place! I get along great with other dogs and have also done wonderfully with the cats! I am great with children too! My foster parents say that I am required to go home to a house with a yard for me to run and play in! I would also LOVE to have another pup sibling to rough and tumble with! If you think thatI would be a good match for your family, send AZ Rez-cue an email so we can get together!\n\nPLEASE INCLUDE: \nTell us about your family! \nDo you have other animals at home? \nDo you rent or own your home? Does it have a fenced yard or park option? \nHave you owned animals in the past? If so, what kind? \nDo you have any questions for us? \n\nEmails that do not include this information will not be considered, as our adoption process required this knowledge to move forward! Thank you for your interest in one of our Rez-cues!",

            "description": "Olive, Date of Birth-12-31-2018, is part of a seizure from a breeder. Dogs from breeders are seldom housetrained or socialized.  Olive is very sweet, seems to love dogs and people, will give kisses, but is shy, so fast ,movements scare he. She has shown no aggression, loves food and treats, is stocky like an Australian Shepherd, and has a Aussie tail, but her personality is definitely Poodley. She is known as an AussieDoodle. She slept quietly in her crate last night, her first night here. She did not soil her crate, which is great news.\nShe goes out willingly and comes in willingly.  When I pet her face she stands up on her hind feet. She weighs about 25 lbs., is definitely a chow hound so her weight needs to be watched, and fed appropriate amounts or she would gain very quickly.\n\nShe walks ok on a leash, but needs practice. She reacts best to a soft and loving voice.  She won't be placed with small kids since I don't know if she has been around kids, but 12 and up should be ok if the child has been taught to respect animals and treats her gently.\n\nOlive's  adoption fee is $300.00. She is fully vetted, spayed, micro chipped, had a dental and her ears were cleaned and medicated. She doesn't like grooming, but will need a gentle groomer, because her hair grows like a Poodles. She especially doesn't like the clippers on her face. The breeder seldom groomed/shaved her.\n\nIf interested in adopting Olive, e-mail me and tell me about your home, yard, how long you are gone from home for work, play, and your family, other dogs and kids.\n\ne-mail- heartofamerica99@aol.com",

Rex loves everyone and everything and would love a family who is going to include him in every day activities, as he is keen to be involved! As a puppy, he does still have a tendency to nibble on fingers, ears, objects, etc. so his owner will need to be careful to keep things out of his reach. He has a lot of energy to spare, so older children or an animal friend would be ideal! Because of his mouthiness, we believe he would do best in a home with children over 8 years of age.\n\nMeet and greets by appointment only",

Mine in Benny Benson!\nI\u2019m searching for a forever family to call my own, so I never have to be given up again!\nDon\u2019t worry, I am fixed, fully vetted and about 1.5 years old! Just enough of a puppy still but ready to mature in the next year or so!\n\nWhat kind of things do you like to do for fun?  I\u2019m a good amount of energy and like to romp around, but boy do I know how to sit back and relax at home!  I\u2019m still getting use to toys, not sure what to do with them much, but I LOVE treats! You ever seen anyone else do the two-step hoppity hop over treats and food time? NO!? Well, I can show ya!  I\u2019m addicted to belly rubs and wanting to be petted. I\u2019ll literally melt into your arms or lap if you think you\u2019d like to give the belly a rubbin\u2019 ! I like to keep it on the low-key and not talk about it much, but I wasn\u2019t treated very nicely in my prior life, so moving your hands too quick over my head or towards me may make me duck a bit, but the most dangerous thing I\u2019d do back is give you major puppy eyes.  Due to this, young children may not be the best fit for me so I think I\u2019d be happier with children 10+ who are dog savvy and who know how to respect boundaries, should the need ever arise.  \n\nMy foster mum says I go into new environments scared and nervous, so I don\u2019t really show much of my personality right off the bat.  When I first moved in with her, I ignored every kitty (out of 5!) in the house and settled quickly and quietly into my crate.  After a few days, I started to feel better and decided, you know what, I think chasing a kitty will be fun!  I also did this to mums horses and after a few days I wanted to try and taste one!  So, mum says she think it\u2019ll be best if there were no kitties in my new forever home, just to be on the safe side.  I\u2019m great with other dogs! Personally, I\u2019d say I am more on the submissive side when interacting with new pups, but I haven\u2019t met any dominant dogs yet.  I haven\u2019t felt the need to resource guard anything like food or toys around people or dogs- mum says I\u2019m awesome like that! I sleep well through the night in a crate- sometimes I can be a bit \"whiney\" mum says but I settle easily with a crate cover if needed. I go on car rides very nicely! I'm pretty quiet and don't seem to get car sick. I would make an AWESOME barn hunt dog! You know, the thing where I have to search hay bales for the mice? Mum says I seem like a natural with it!  What I\u2019d love best is a relatively quiet but active family with a great fenced yard that I can continue to romp around happily and follow you around the house. Mum says I am way too SWEET to not get the best life possible! Can\u2019t wait to meet ya!\n\nLocated in Zebulon, NC. For questions, please contact Tulips1990@gmail.com.\n\nCOMPLETE AN APPLICATION\nhttp://www.acdra.org/adoption-application\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She can be very timid and apprehensive around strangers, but patience and understanding will be rewarded with a very loyal and sweet girl. It will take her some time and maybe several visits from people before she will be comfortable with your regular guests so a quiet home without a lot of visitors would be ideal for her. Please no children under 15. \nDelilah is fantastic on leash and the only issue you might have is her giving a little woof or shying away when you encounter strangers otherwise she walks right beside you on leash. Regular walks and playtime will keep her happy and out of mischief as this girl has a lot of energy. Delilah gets along great with the other dogs in her foster home and loves to play with them. Cats are unknown. We think she would be a great candidate for someone who would like to train a small dog for agility. But just a loving home and daily walks will make her happy. She is definitely a lap dog and likes nothing better than to be near her human. \nShe is crate trained and for the most part house trained. Some reinforcement when she first gets to her new home will be needed to show her where she goes and to learn her signs of knowing when she needs to go out as she is not very vocal about it. Once she is comfortable in her forever home that will probably improve. She knows a few basic commands but we strongly suggest a puppy class; it is an amazing way for you to bond and it will do wonders in boosting her confidence.\n",

He loves receiving attention and can be vocal when he wants you to know that. George is very smart and will happily give you his paw to shake or high-five. He gets very excited when he sees treats and tries his best to sit still, but sometimes his wiggly butt takes over!\n\nGeorge is a strong boy with a lot of energy, so he would benefit from an active home that can get him all the exercise he needs. He enjoys playing with other dogs, specifically those that match him in size and energy level. George has told us he doesn't enjoy being restrained, so a home with older children that understand this might be best for him.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

            "description": "Johnny / Male / 9 Months / 60 lbs / Plott Hound Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Johnny! Johnny is described as eager to please, affectionate, energetic, friendly and excitable. He loves people and is happiest when receiving attention from his family or anyone who is willing! He loves long walks, playing in the snow, figuring out puzzles or chewing on his bones. Johnny is a true dream dog. He is more than ready for a loving and active family to call his own!\n\nWhen walking down the street, Johnny shows interest in every person and dog that passes him. He will want to greet some people and can get a little bouncy and eager to give them kisses. He is very friendly but may need support and guidance on proper introductions. He doesn\u2019t know his own size so may knock over small children by accident. He has also been known to nip in play, so even though he is always friendly, would do best with children that are ages 10+.\n\nStill very much a puppy, Johnny needs to be provided with appropriate places to chew. If he gets bored, he will look for ways to entertain himself. If he can\u2019t be supervised, he will need to be put in a puppy proofed space with safe things to chew. He is a very good boy and can usually be redirected as needed. Johnny does not like to be alone yet, and will be quite vocal when his foster Mom leaves. Adopters should have a flexible schedule to support him through his separation anxiety. When the radio is left on, he settles much quicker. With the right structure he will likely adjust quickly to a regular schedule.\n\nJohnny is learning proper leash manners but will need continued support. He will pull when he sees/smells something and has selective hearing when he\u2019s distracted. He can be reactive to other people and dogs, but it\u2019s just because he wants to introduce himself. He needs a strong and patient handler willing to work with him on this. Generally, he just wants to play with dogs but has never been taught how to approach. He is on the higher side of medium energy, and will need a minimum of two long walks a day plus additional time in the backyard.\n\nJohnny\u2019s ideal home would be a detached house, with a fully fenced backyard. He can not be trusted in an unsecured space yet and will need supervision even in the backyard. He needs support with basic obedience and house manners in his forever home. Johnny would love to have another playful dog in the home, but it\u2019s not essential as long as he gets consistent socialization. Johnny has a cat in his foster home and loves to play with her! Resident cats should be dog savvy and have adequate areas to escape if they need a break.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Johnny please fill out an application at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/dog-adoption/\n\nJohnny\u2019s adoption fee is $850.

I'm a good boy that doesn't want to be cow poke wandering America. Now, all I want to do is be part of a family. I always have a pleasant disposition but I don't understand what that camera is all about! So saddle up and come down to claim me, I'm good as gold!\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:Tanner is a good looking dog that is only 2 years old and 51 pounds. He is very sweet and loves to be around people. He likes other dogs too! So come down and pick up this cowboy today!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Rocky!\n\nDo you like other dogs? I get excited around other dogs and will need a dog that can tolerate my energy level! I will need to meet any potential new canine friends at the shelter before going home. \n\nWhat do you think about cats? I have no history with cats. I may do best in a cat free home.\n\nSo how do you feel about kids? I lived with kids around 10 and older. But I can play rough at times, so I would do best with older kids that can tolerate my energy and play style. \n\nWhat's your energy level like? I have a high energy level! \n\nWhat is it that staff and volunteers love about you? I am a super sweet guy with lots of energy! I do need some training and lots of exercise to become the best dog I can be! I have lived most of my life as an outside dog and I am most likely not house trained.\n\nIs there anything else we should know about you? I am 8 months old and I weigh between 78-83 pounds.\n\nI came into the shelter as a surrender and the above information is all recommendations based on my previous history and the behavior seen at the shelter. Expect to learn more about me after adoption.\n\nIt is unknown how this animal will do in their new home as all animals can be different with each person. It is important to take this into consideration when thinking about adopting and making sure you are prepared to work with any potential medical or behavior issues that occur after adoption.\n\nMy adoption fee includes my spay/neuter, current vaccinations, permanent microchip identification, certificate for a free veterinary exam, post-adoption support and more!\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! If you think we would be a good match call and ask about me! I'm looking for my forever home and it could be with you!\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION: If you live in the city of Eugene or in Lane County you will be purchasing a dog license in addition to the adoption fee. You will get to choose between a one year, two year, or three year license. \nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503. See all of the pets at this shelter by visiting www.green-hill.org.",

He made so many doggy BFFs here, and may like a brother or sister to live with. He can be very rambunctious when he plays, and would love a canine sibling that enjoys his play style and can keep up with him.

            "description": "Athena is an adorable and shy little lady on the search for a special family and forever home. Athena is very nervous in new situations and when meeting new people, so she does best with slow and gentle introductions. Taking her on walks, gentle petting (but not too much at first), words of encouragement, and treats help Athena become more comfortable, though it may take her a little time to warm up! She would thrive in a home where her adopters can give her the time and space she needs to acclimate and be her advocate in new situations where she might be uncomfortable. Athena spent some time in a foster home, where we learned that she preferred to spend time in her safe spaces in the home, where she could always go to be comfortable. Once more familiar, Athena likes to stay close to her people. She also really enjoys walks, but in quiet, low-traffic areas because the traffic can be scary for her. When she is in the mood, she'll even pick up a toy or two! Athena did well meeting other dogs and might benefit from having a doggy buddy in her new home that can show her that things are not so scary. Athena would do best in a quiet home with older children and without a lot of visitors. If you are looking for a quiet and gentle girl to welcome into your family and give lots of TLC to, ask about adopting sweet Athena today!",

She is looking for a home that is willing to help her decompress and work on socialization so that she can be her best doggy self!\n\nJackie is calm around other dogs and she would benefit from having a social helper dog in her new home. She would love a friend to help her feel more comfortable. Jackie gets nervous easily from quick movements, so a home with older children might be the best fit for her. \n\nJackie is a huge sweetheart who just needs the perfect family to give all her love to. \n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

Ice loves to sit between your legs for pets and has some interest in toys. Due to his shyness, if there are children in the home they would need to be 16 or older. He can be picky with his dog friends, and would need a slow introduction at first. \n\nIf Ice sounds like the dog that you're looking for, give our adoption counselors a call at 330-487-0333 ext 226 to learn more about how our adoption by appointment program works!",

I sometimes have a bit of a wheeze, but the docs tell me that's not a problem. My foster mom tells me I sometimes snore so cutely...:). I warm quickly to new people, especially when they have a treat for me or let me climb into their lap. I like going on walks and am happy to go at a leisurely pace or pick up the speed if we're both in the mood! I like exploring my surroundings but I especially like being in the same room as you are. Oh, and I'm crate trained and potty trained :-). \n\nIf you're interested in meeting me, reach out at jbshipley@me.com! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiI4IW1lyLo",

She has lovely manners with people of all ages including children and is housetrained, nondestructive, knows 'sit' and 'come' and is generally content to doze on her bed. She gives hugs and is an expert level snuggler. She knows she's royalty and would prefer to be admired properly as the only dog in the home. She was able to successfully co-exist with a dog savvy cat in her foster home, but she will chase a cat that runs from her, so any feline companions must have the confidence to stand their ground. She would prefer a living situation where she has a yard to spend time in or the space to avoid other dogs on walks. Judy loves hopping in the car and going for rides or coming to work with you if you're into that. For someone looking for a low-maintenance, pleasant companion, Judy would be an excellent choice.\n\nFor more information call (801) 261-2919 ext. 227 or drop by to meet her at our Murray location.",

Rocky gets excited over the little things and his butt never stops wiggling.\n\nRocky loves soaking up any attention that you have to give and he'll sit by your side all day long for pets. He's very gentle and would make a great family dog. A yummy treat or a squeaky toy will really get his tail moving, and he'll happily sit for either of them. Rocky adores going on walks, but is a strong boy that could use a little help learning restraint and good walking manners. \n\nRocky would be happy to meet any other 4-legged or 2-legged friends that live in the home.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

She likes to keep her area extra clean and tidy. She has requested a family that will dote on her and include her in all the best activities. Betty Sue is a little package just bursting at the seems with love. \n\nBetty Sue currently weighs around 10 pounds.  She does well with other dogs, after a proper introduction.  \n\nWe require a non-refundable $20 adoption application fee. Farm Friends Rescue often receives more adoption applications than we have dogs in our program. We are a team of volunteers and processing those applications takes time and resources. Placing one of our dogs into a home is a responsibility that we take seriously. Our goal is to find the best forever family for each and every dog. By charging this small fee, we will ensure that only the most committed potential adopters start the process.",

If you knew Rocky, you would not believe his breed makeup as he possesses no traits of a Heeler or a Rotti!  He is not hyper or super active, in fact he is a more low key and calm boy.  That could be due, in part, to his age, but his personality is also fantastic!  He is sweet as pie, loves the 8 other dogs he is currently living with (one in particular named Sara who is a border collie and is his BFF) and he loves kids.  Although Rocky hasn't been living with cats, he has zero prey drive and wouldn't hurt a fly so we know he would be fine with them.  Rocky is housetrained and fine in a crate, but does not need one as he has great house manners.  Rocky's only issue is that he is a very shy boy so we think he would probably do best in a forever home where there is another dog to provide him with a little confidence and a patient owner who will give him some time to settle into his new surroundings.  We would also like for Rocky to have a physically fenced yard where he can roam freely off leash.\n\nRocky is neutered, healthy and ready to head to his forever home in New England.  If you live in CT, NJ, NY or PA and are looking for the sweetest most submissive dog ever, please complete an application on our website!  www.asecondchanceforziva.org",

He\u2019s a forward but smart puppy needing someone willing to continue socialization, exposure, and training.\n\nBecause he was found at 4 weeks and spent his early months without other pups, Leo has been catching up on socialization in foster care where he is meeting many dogs! Leo needs to go to a home with a teacher dog (a balanced mature dog) who can show him the ropes.\n\nDog experience during adult-life is required, along with willingness and time to raise a puppy. No children under 14 years of age in the home.\n\nLeo is crate training, leash training and potty training in foster. He is neutered and up to date on shots.\n\nApplicants fulfilling the aforementioned requirements can inquire, and/or set up a meeting with Leo, by filling out application (copy and paste link): https://bluemandog.org/adoption-application/\n\nWe adopt our dogs in the greater LA area and nearby cities.

She can be a little nervous when first meeting new people, but she warms up quickly and she'll show you her adorable smile.\n\nKindle loves treats and she'll happily sit for any that you'll give her. She loves to run around and play with toys! She tries her best to catch a tennis ball out of the air and bring it back to you when you throw it. Kindle seems to be very calm around other doggy friends. \n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

            "description": "Hello this is Spike.  He is an approximately 1 year old neutered Pit Bull terrier.  He is full of puppy energy and will need a fenced yard for sure to play in while he is outside.  He is a super sweet boy who loves the volunteers.  He was a stray dog that was not claimed and the previous owners did not train him so we are trying to work on leash and basic commands.  This will need to continue in his new home.  He is a very handsome boy!!  We have not had him with other dogs much yet as we are trying to work on training a bit more first.  He seems as if he really wants to play with other dogs though.  He runs the fences in the dog park beside other dogs.  He also does not ever have accidents in his kennel so we hope he is house trained.  He would be a great dog with someone who has had previous experience with the breed.  His adoption fee is $160.00. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please fill out our short Adoption Application to start the adoption process. An adoption application can be completed & submitted on our website yorkadoptapet.com. For more information on any of the dogs available for adoption contact kim@yorkadoptapet.com . All applications need to be approved prior to adoption and approval may take up to 1 week.",

Overall Cinna is in good health with no concerns.\n\nBehaviorally, Cinna is sweet as can be and has done amazing with everyone she has met.  She loves both men and women of all ages, big and small.  She also absolutely loves playing with other dogs. She likes vocal, exuberant play and will need dogs that enjoy her energy level.  Cinna does not like being in a crate (likely due from past kennel stress), but does great when left home alone & is house trained as well. She loves her bones, rope toys, snacks & walks.  Cinna is overall an amazing dog that will thrive in most home settings that are ready to give an energetic dog a forever home!\n\nTo apply for Cinna directly:\n\nhttps://pitofoursoulsrescue.com/our-dogs/adoption-application/",

My siblings and I were turned into animal control because our previous owner stopped feeding us. We were kept in a dirt lot and were slowly withering away. lucky for us, a good samaritan called animal control to report us. The bad news is that because we were in such poor body condition, we were immediately placed on the euthanasia list. Luckily our rescuers came just in time to save us! Now that we have gotten up t a healthy weight, and have gotten the green light from the vet, we are ready to meet you! \n\nI am a sweet and playful girl that would love nothing more than a human to play with and a soft couch to relax on! I am a very friendly and outgoing girl and I know that I will be the perfect addition to any family! I get along great with other dogs and have also done wonderfully with the cats! I am great with children too! My foster parents say that I am required to go home to a house with a yard for me to run and play in! I would also LOVE to have another pup sibling to rough and tumble with! If you think thatI would be a good match for your family, send AZ Rez-cue an email so we can get together!\n\nPLEASE INCLUDE: \nTell us about your family! \nDo you have other animals at home? \nDo you rent or own your home? Does it have a fenced yard or park option? \nHave you owned animals in the past? If so, what kind? \nDo you have any questions for us? \n\nEmails that do not include this information will not be considered, as our adoption process required this knowledge to move forward! Thank you for your interest in one of our Rez-cues!",

            "description": "Tasha / Female / 1 Year / 35 lbs / Mountain Cur Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Tasha! Tasha comes to us al the way from Hohenwald, Tennessee! Tasha has been in foster care for a few weeks now, and continues to open up and come out of her shell. What her fosters have discovered so far is that she is sweet, playful, affectionate, timid and social. She loves to be part of the family and has nothing but potential ahead of her. When she\u2019s not chewing on her bones or toys, she loves to play with other dogs! Tasha is now more than ready for a family of her own!\n\nTasha is cautious when meeting new people and may keep her distance. If people are calm generally it won\u2019t take her long to come around for a sniff. Adopters should have realistic expectations when meeting her, as it will take time to earn her trust. Once you have built a bond with Tasha, you will have a friend for life!\n\nTasha is currently getting multiple walks a day, but still has accidents in the home. She will need support through potty training and be given time to adjust in a new environment. Outside she is fearful of loud or unexpected noises, so needs to be safely secured at all times. She may take a few minutes to gain the confidence to walk by something scary, but with gentle encouragement she is on her way. She is especially afraid of loud or large vehicles.\n\nTasha has not been left alone much in foster care, so it is unknown if she has any separation anxiety. If transitioning her to be alone for long periods, adopters should have a flexible schedule while she adjusts. Tasha will chew things around the house so she needs to be in a puppy proofed space for her safety. She also can jump high and will counter surf if given the chance!\n\nShe is very smart but has not mastered any commands yet. Once she is given time to decompress in her new home, she will benefit from ongoing obedience training. Still very much a puppy, she will need some encouragement for proper house manners and leash etiquette. Tasha loves to sniff so handlers should always have high value treats on hand to gain her focus!\n\nTasha would do best in a house, outside of the city. She is unsettled by the chaos city life so she will thrive in a suburban or country life. Tasha will need a fully fenced backyard to run, play and get out her zoomies! She loves the company of other dogs and all though not essential, would love another well adjusted dog in the home. Tasha would also do well with respectful children that are ages 10+.!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Tasha please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nTasha\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

We've been fostering her since the puppies from her last (and final) litter were weaned and adopted and she has truly brightened our lives in the time she's been with us. My teens declared early on that \"snuggle is Lola's love language and that pretty much says it all. Lola is masterful at getting as close to the people she loves as possible and showing you that you're the most important thing in her life. She is well-behaved and knows some basic commands, but she would benefit from some additional training, including leash training. Lola did fine with our existing dog, but my heart tells me that Lola would be happiest in a one-dog family. She has been fantastic with kids, although my only experience is with teenagers and dogs, and not little ones. I imagine she would be fine with children of all ages - she's got a very loving personality. The family or individual that ends up with Lola is going to be one very lucky family/person - we love her to death and while we'll hate to see her leave, we can't wait until her forever family finds her and gets to experience how amazing this sweet girl is.",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. Kasey does have a skin allergy and we give her an allergy shot every month.\n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. \n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

He is in need of a new loving home that can shower him with attention and exercise. \nHe was surrendered to us due to eye problems that require medical treatment and result in eyesight issues. He moves around extremely well for his condition, it just takes him some time to adjust to his surroundings (he\u2019s a pro at stairs now!) He does require a lot of exercise and stimulation and loves to go on runs/walks around the neighborhood. Oakley talks and sings to his family members and loves to cuddle. He really loves playing with his foster siblings and would do great in a home with other dogs. He does best with dogs his size or larger, so we are looking for a home with no cats or small dog breeds. ?Oakley struggles to spend time in his crate and has chewed through crates/destroyed crates to escape in the past. Fortunately, he does great being left around the house when left out. He is potty trained. He has been destructive to things before if they are left down in his reach but most of the time does well with enough exercise. \nHis eyes are being managed by eye drops administered twice per day (morning & evening) but he will need continued care for his eye condition. Other than little bumps here and there around the house, you can hardly notice his eyesight issues. He\u2019s happy and comfortable with life, just wants human and doggie playmates to enjoy it with.",

He's big now so once he finishes growing he will be BIG. \n Bringing Dax in to your home will be a lot like bringing a 3 month old puppy in to your home. He needs to work on his manners and learn to properly communicate with his people. We're figuring out he is a splendidly quick study, though. He will need time and patience, but once he figures out what you're asking he's excited to do it again!\n Dax will be his best self in an adult-only home. He's also still learning how to be around other dogs so he would prefer to remain your one and only fur-baby for the time being. If this sounds like a good match to your home please fill out an application at www.potterleague.org and give the Adoption Center a call.",

I've heard I have award-winning cuddles and I could be the man for you.  Plus, look at my sad puppy dog eyes, the ones that will make you swoon.  I may be older but I've got plenty of love to give.  I can't scratch the idea that we are made for one another.  Or it may be that I have some itchy skin that they are giving me meds for to help clear up the issue.  But regardless, we ARE made for one another.  Think you can grab me and take me home before Valentine's Day?  I want to be your one and only.",

            "description": "Meet Gigi!  She is an amazing one year old, 60 pound dog that was hit by a car and miraculously survived.  She was seriously injured, though.  Gigi's pelvis was broken and one rear leg had been dislocated from its hip socket.  She had dozens of scrapes on her lower legs, too  The impact must have been enormous to cause so many skin tears and bone fractures.\n\nHer former owner signed her over to animal control because they were not able to pay for her care.  We got Gigi  from animal control and she went directly to the vet clinic where she had orthopedic surgery the next day to repair both problems.  $4000 later, she is a happy girl and looking for her forever home.\n\nGigi is loving, house broken and can use a doggie door to let herself out.  She would love a doggie playmate and maybe some kids to love on her.  She still walks with a limp, but that will resolve with time as her muscles get built up again.  She is not in any pain, and loves to play with squeaky toys.  She especially likes the small ones that fit easily in her mouth.  Gigi is living with several other small dogs and gets along well with them.  She sleeps in her doggie bed every night.\n\nGigi has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  Her adoption fee is $300.00.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this cutie, please write us at PricelessPoochRescue@gmail.com and ask for an application to adopt.  We are a foster-home based organization and Gigi is currently located in Hayesville, North Carolina, with frequent trips to the Atlanta area for adoptions.  The adoption process starts when you submit your application.  Once that has been approved, we will contact you to schedule a time for you to meet us.",

These puppies are super sweet and on a great track to being adult dogs. They have a variety of breeds in them making them the perfect mutt. They will need basic training and socialization which will take some time and dedication to ensure they grow up to be awesome adult dogs!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue.

I'm a shy dog that needs help in finding my confidence.  I enjoy other dogs and would do well with another dog in the home.  I'm gentle with people, just very unsure with life in general. If you have patience and time to let me adjust, you'll have changed my life completely around.  Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

            "description": "Meet Danny!\n\nThis adorable boy came to us from a neglect situation initially.  He was not abused, but the person who had him was physically unable to care for a puppy so family members stepped in and asked us to rehome him.  Danny is a typically sweet, playful puppy who just needs a forever family to love him.  He wants to play and snuggle in equal measure.  He will do best with a family who wants to play and interact with their puppy.  At this age he is probably a little overpowering for toddlers unless he is with a family that knows the Husky breed mix and can help toddlers through this stage.  Older children and all other people would be fine.  He is friendly and social.  He gets along well with dogs of all sizes.  We do not know how he would be with cats, but it is likely he\u2019d want to play with them.\n\nDanny is right at 4 months old and weighs about 20 lbs.  We expect he will be a medium sized adult dog (45-55 lbs ?) but could be wrong about that.  He is house trained to a doggy door.\n\nIf you think you might want to give this sweet pup a home, please email jojosdogrescue@gmail.com and we will send you an application, or visit our website: www.jojosdoghouse.com and download one.  Adoption fee is $250, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, parasite treatment, and microchip with lifetime registration.\n\nPlease visit our Facebook page JoJo's DogHouse (non-profit) to learn more about us and see many of the dogs we have rescued. We hope you'll join JoJo's family of adopters. \n",

He does well on a leash already. Rarely has accidents in his crate at night. He gets along great with other dogs and would make a great little buddy. Very brave and adventurous. Likes car rides and meeting new people. He even lets us put him in clothes when it is cold out. Likes the cats too. Harry is everyone's best little buddy and an awesome little puppy. 12/10 will be your best friend.\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

He did well with all of them and would love to have companions in his new home!\n\nScooby is a typical hound who loves to use his nose to explore.  His nose tends to lead him astray thus he cannot be trusted off leash.  He would love to find a home with a fenced in yard where he can play freely and safely!  He would also make a great hiking partner!  Once he's tired out he is a wonderful snuggle buddy and will remind you to keep the pets coming by gently nudging you hand!\n\nHe is 1.5 years old and weighs 37.5 pounds.\n\n***If you are interested in adopting please start by filling out an application available on our website and email it to us. https://www.couleehumane.com/adopt-an-animal",

            "description": "Rocky Road / Male / 10 Months / 40 lbs / Mountain Cur Mix / Oakville\n\nMeet Rocky Road aka Rocky! Rocky comes to us all the way from Hohenwald, Tennessee! Rocky is described as affectionate, cuddly, loyal, playful and timid. He has been known to follow his fosters from room to room, gently licking their hands in hopes of getting a belly rub. He\u2019s never met a squeaky toy he didn\u2019t like, and his fosters discovered he has a particular affinity to a rubber fox. If you let him, Rocky can entertain himself all day with his toys. Rocky is looking for a patient and loving family to expose his full potential!\n\nWith people he hasn\u2019t met before, he can be a little shy, but he is calm and keeps his distance. If given time to warm up, he will open up fairly quickly and be your new best friend. Rocky make take longer with some people, and new people should always be instructed to give him space. He hasn\u2019t been tested with small children, but given his nature we predict he would do well children ages 10+, as long as they respect his space when needed.\n\nAs he has likely had little exposure to leashes, collars or harnesses, he is fearful of them. When he does get on leash, he freezes and it can take a few minutes to get him to leave the home. His forever family should be willing to desensitize him to his fears on leash, and build his confidence enough so he can enjoy walking with his people. While he adjusts, he will require a fully fenced back yard to drain physical and mental energy, along with enrichment games throughout the day. As he can be skittish with new people and loud noises, he should always be supervised in the backyard.\n\nStill very much a puppy, Rocky's potty training is a work in progress. He wants to go outside, but he is still very fearful of the great outdoors. He will require a lot of patience, encouragement and consistency to build his confidence. His loving foster family has only had him for a few short weeks and they have already seen huge improvements. When he is left alone or at night, he is crated and settles quickly. If he is taken outside enough, Rocky has very few accidents.\n\nRocky is crated when left alone and hasn\u2019t had any issues so far. If he\u2019s has enough exercise for the day, he will sleep through the night! If left unsupervised, Rocky will chew things when he gets bored. He is a very good boy though, and usually just chews his toys.\n\nRocky's ideal family will have the time and resources to commit to his ongoing training, socialization and confidence building. He would prefer a home outside of the city or downtown core, and one with a fully fenced backyard. He has done well with dogs in the past, but he will resource guard toys if he doesn\u2019t have enough structure. Potential adopters should have some experience managing this behavior and be able to redirect as needed. Rocky is only looking for cat-free homes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rocky please fill out an application at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/dog-adoption/\n\nRocky\u2019s adoption fee is $850.

The pups were approximately 6 weeks of age when they came to us. (A picture of her mom is also included.)\n\nTabitha is your typical playful, friendly pup. She's smart and seems to have, a desire to learn new things which will help with her needed training. Tabitha plays well with her siblings, interacts very well with people and has all the makings of a great family companion.\n\nTabitha has now received all three of her first year puppy vaccines, de-wormed and treated against parasites.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Name: Bear\nAge: 15 years\nGender: Male\nBreed: Lhasa Apso mix\nWeight: 30 lbs\nDog friendly: TBD\nCat friendly: Unknown\nKid friendly: No\nHouse Trained: Yes\nCrate Trained: In progress\nEnergy level: Low\nHistory: Owner surrender\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFrom the Foster:\n\nIf you're looking for a new companion who will add some serious cuteness to your life, Bear may be for you! Bear is an incredibly sweet, kind, old soul. He is a go-with-the-flow guy; ready with a wagging tail for a walk at a moment's notice, but also totally fine lounging the day away!\n\nThe main things to know about Bear: he's friendly to the people he has met, agreeable on walks with other dogs and people around. He is house trained, but not sure how well he will adapt to a crate - he certainly has made his distaste known when inside it! Bear's current house does not have other dogs, cats, or kiddos, so not sure how he would adapt to them. His current fosters think he was previously the only dog in the house, but would probably be okay with a buddy! Bear is welcoming to visitors - previous owners reported some aggression with young kids, but he likely would do alright with school aged or older kids in the house. He has been a total happy camper with adults. He is a curious one on walks; he does very well on a leash, but also likes to take it fairly slow.\n\nWhile he is not a beagle like Snoopy, he has some \"Joe Cool\" energy. He enjoys human company as well as plenty of naps - he would be flexible, and likely adapt well to a variety of households. He has no notable arthritis, although would prefer to limit stair climbing in general. He takes a daily liver supplement (with no issues, all you need is a bit of peanut butter!) and would need lab monitoring every 6 months. While he's not a big cuddler, he's the type of companion who always wants to be near his humans. He doesn't require much socialization or mental stimulation and would LOVE for his next home to be the perfect place to live out his golden years.",

            "description": "The name Paloma means beautiful and this gal is just that and more. Just look at this unique black and grey coat. And her eyes! Hello? They are mesmerizing! A tranquil blue/grey. Ok, enough about the obvious. Deep down, all Paloma really wants out of life is a young and or active family or couple to take her on jaunts on a hiking trail or a run on the beach. A big backyard? Yes, please. A dog park? Let's go! She's a youngster, around 1-2 years old, full of life, and ready to please. She weighs about 36 pounds. She gets on well with her buds at the farm and is always on the go, go, go! Super curious and wants to meet and greet everyone! She sleeps awesome in her crate and is potty trained. She also does very well walking on a leash. This beautiful girl is anxious to meet you, too!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Penelope (AKA Penny) is a healthy 3-year-old female who is housebroken, spayed, and up-to-date on all her shots. Her days are very structured and she is doing very well with her foster family, but she is looking for a forever home! She is learning basic commands and needs someone who will continue with her  training. Her foster dad\u2019s dedication and patience have allowed her to come out of her shell and now her true personality shines through!\n\nPenny has been in a foster home since early January. She is currently living with 4 adults and one 8-year-old child in the home, as well as 2 parakeets. Although she\u2019s loving and friendly with everyone in the household and everyone she meets, at this time we feel that a home without small children or small animals would be best so that she can continue to blossom the way she has been over the last several weeks. She\u2019ll do well with an active family, but does best in a calm home environment. Meet and greets are required for any potential fur siblings. She does well in the car and walks nice on lead. Penny does well being left alone at home and is currently in the process of being crate trained.\n\nFrom her foster dad:\n\u201cI would describe her as medium energy. She loves chilling on the couch as much as exploring new places. She\u2019s young and athletic and perfectly capable of keeping up with outdoor adventures. She\u2019ll ramp up her energy to match yours. At the same time, after long activity periods, she\u2019ll sleep soundly on the couch or bed or wherever. And she loves cuddles. Often peaking with one eye to make sure you\u2019re still there.\u201d\n\nPenny is a bouncy, affectionate, and playful sweetheart. We know her forever family is out there and whoever is lucky enough to adopt Penny will have a best friend for life!\n\nAPPLY TO ADOPT PENNY:\nwww.oatsandgoatsrescue.com/adopt\n\nFollow Her Adventures with her Foster Dad:\nwww.m.Facebook.com/PittiePenelope\n\nFollow Our Facebook Page for More Updates and Videos:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/oatsandgoatsrescue/",

            "description": "Chance is a very special and handsome Texas Blue Heeler puppy that is needing a home that understands his breed and his quiet shyness. This puppy has been through so much at a young age and is what you would call a SURVIVOR! He is such a sweet, special boy who needs just the right family for his forever home. When Chance first came into foster care, he was so scared of new people and surroundings that he hid behind the couch and refused to come out. He wouldn't walk on a leash, and he cowered and ran when someone approached him. A few weeks later, he has come such a long way!! He loves to snuggle in bed and get belly rubs, enjoys car rides to and from school every day, and looks forward to his daily walks around the neighborhood with his buddy Rocky (a 2 year old Golden retriever). He is still scared of new people though. When kids in the neighborhood come out to pet Rocky, Chance hides behind his foster mom and doesn't want to be touched. He is quite territorial also and gives delivery men more than a friendly bark when they step on our porch. Chance is scared of loud noises along with unfamiliar people, and he startles very easily. He needs a quiet home environment with a family who will be patient and understanding with him as he takes the time he needs to adjust to his new life. Once he feels safe and loved, Chance will bond very strongly with the person or people that belong to him. Then he won't be able to give or get enough love. He'll follow you from room to room, sit in your lap for love, and will always want to be close to your side. A home without young children will be best for him since he does prefer predictable behavior from his humans. He currently lives with cats and can't resist chasing them for fun but doesn't exhibit any aggression toward them at all. He would do very well in a home with another dog. He has bonded with Rocky and definitely has more confidence and less fear when the two of them are together. He is nervous and hesitant to walk on a leash alone but trots along by Rocky's side wherever he goes. The two of them also enjoy daily \"tough puppy\" play. They enjoy wrestling and chasing each other around the yard.. and swiping each other's toys and chew bones when they get a good opportunity. Ideally Chance would like a fenced in yard and/or several acres of land to call his own. Such a wonderful handsome boy for just the right family with the experience, love, and understanding he needs to grow and thrive. This boy is not Mr. Congeniality. He is a smart, devoted but damaged early in his life Blue Heeler that just needs a quiet and non-busy home.\n\nPlease email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED.

This handsome boy is a happy and fun loving dog That just needs a home and some one on one attention and guidance. He is good with other dogs and adores people. He will chase a cat that runs And he would need to be with children that are 8 years and above because he might be too much energy for toddlers. At some point in his young Life he has probably been grazed by a car and his leg mended with no medical attention. He is fast as the win but he does show a limp when not running. It doesn't slow him down or bother him. He is not inside in a home right now. Best we could do to help him out of his predicament was give him a foster Who cares and an outdoor pen with a warm dog house and straw and great food. He is learning the leash but still has some training. This is a good dog with great potential. When we say Rescue.we mean RESCUE FIREMAN SAM!

The first step in our adoption process is to fill out an adoption application at www.snarrnortheast.org. PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO & FAQs BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Topaz\n*Age: 4 months\n*Current Weight: 15 pounds\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $495 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: up to date on puppy shots so far (adopter will be responsible for remaining puppy vaccinations)\n\nTopaz and her littermates are arriving in New York soon and ready to meet their amazing new families and enjoy a whole new life.  They are an active bunch and love wrestling with each other.  Their mom is a small breed terrier mix around 25 pounds, we think the dad is a neighbor's dog  that's medium size probably a Australian shepherd/lab mix.  Another friendly dog in the house would be great for these cuties, an older playful canine sibling can teach them house manners and show them how to live the good life.  These puppies may be a little timid at first, when separated from their littermates, but we are sure that won't last long.  We can't wait for these guys to learn all about snow.  If you are looking for a pretty girl with energy and puppy kisses to give, maybe Topaz is the pup for you.\n\nThis litter of adorable puppies was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. They will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on February 17 ready for adoption! \n\nIMPORTANT: This puppy has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nTo apply to adopt a puppy from this litter, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications.  \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\nWe do recommend listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice when applying for puppies with several littermates.\n(Littermates: )\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n",

Although he is house trained and knows basic commands.Tux is great with children but at this time we recommend children 6 and up only until he learns some basic manners (how to be respectful of people and how to practice patience)Tux has little social skills with other dogs, not aggressively but will need continuous slow introductions to other dogs to learn doggy manners and become more comfortable around them.\nit seems that Tux was deprived of basic social interaction in his young years. The great thing is that he is very food motivated a fast learner.Please stay tuned about this pretty boy as he settles into his foster home.",

He may do well with other dogs in the home if given a proper introduction. We will require a dog meet with any resident dogs to make sure it is a good match.\n\nJax is a big baby who loves to be around his family.  He enjoys going for hikes, playing and exploring in the yard, and snuggling up for movie time!  \n\nHe is 5 years old and weighs 120 pounds. Please keep in mind that Jax drools A LOT!\n\n***If you are interested in adopting please start by filling out an application available on our website and email it to us. https://www.couleehumane.com/adopt-an-animal",

            "description": "Ooooh, look at this handsome boy! Say hello to Leo! <3\n\n\"Leo is just about perfect. He has adjusted to indoor life so quickly. He learned he liked comfy beds on the first day. He has learned toys are so fun and he likes to have a lot of them around him. He is a mixture of gentle, loving, playful. He likes to be with his people but is also confident enough to take a quiet nap alone. He loves food and is quite the table surfer but we are working on that one tiny flaw. The foster puppies are teaching him how to play with others and he is quickly catching on. This gentle soul will steal your heart quickly, he did ours!\"\n\nLeo came to us after he went after his owner's poultry. He was a bit too playful to handle a guardian role with them. His owners wanted to make sure he ended up somewhere safe and surrendered him to us. Leo is a 6-month-old male Great Pyrenees/Border Collie mix. He currently weighs about 40lbs. Leo does great when meeting new people. He is a happy, tail wagging goofball but doesn't jump up on people. He would do well in public settings, and would probably try to befriend everyone around! Leo has not shown to have any food aggression or issues with resource guarding in his foster home. He also doesn't jump on people. Leo is initially anxious in the car but settles down quickly. Leo is working on his leash training but is scared on the leash. We do believe that Leo would be a good candidate for apartment living. \n\n\nLeo is a mix of calm and playful. Leo is unfamiliar with playing fetch. We are unsure if he is a water dog or not. Leo does LOVE his toys! Leo has not shown to be a big barker in his foster home. When no one is home, Leo has free-run of the house. At night, Leo sleeps on his fosters bed, couch, or doggie bed. Leo is potty trained, but his foster has not needed to kennel him. \n\nWith his looks and awesome personality, Leo will be the perfect addition to any family! <3 Before you get that app in for him, here are a few additional things to note\n\n-Leo is initially shy of the other dogs. Once he warms up to them he becomes more playful with them. \n\n-Leo is good with cats. \n\n-Leo is good with kids of all ages. He is gentle with them and doesn't jump. \n\n-Leo is still young so his new family should have their house puppy-proofed. So far, Leo has mainly chewed on his toys. Being a pup, he may steal a shoe that is left out, though ;) \n\nLeo would be perfect in any home. He just wants to be with his people. He is a mixture of calm, quiet, loving, and learning how to play. He is very gentle with the puppies, dogs, and cats in the house. He loves to snuggle on the couch or in bed with the kids. He is still learning what a leash does but we believe once he learns it\u2019s ok he will be a perfect companion for any adventure. If you want to find your best friend in Leo, apply to adopt him at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHis adoption fee is $225. That includes DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella shots. She will be micro-chipped, heart-worm tested, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered, and will be current on heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

Hope was brought in on SEVERAL occasions but always reclaimed by her \u201cowner\u201d. We say owner very lightly, how could anyone treat their animal this way, let them suffer in this way, and who in their right mind would give a dog in this condition back to the person who \u201cowned\u201d them. Those scars weren\u2019t all new. Every time Hope was brought into to the shelter she was in this type of horrific condition. Hope was likely running from her abusers trying to escape the life of hell in wich she lived in, only to be caught and brought to a shelter where she had little chance of making it out alive and if she did it was only to be reclaimed and sent back to her life of torture. (After receiving her records we saw documentation of times she was brought to the shelter dating all the way back to 2016!!!!) \n\nHopes photos were posted by a volunteer begging for someone to save her. We saw her, all of her, the scars that covered her body, the crooked jaw, the weepy oozing eyes, the deep open wounds, but what we also saw was her beautiful colors, her contagious smile, her hopeful eyes and her fight to live! Hope was still on her stray hold and we were told her owner would likely come back to reclaim her. We were terrified. Terrified that that monster would come back for her, or what was left of her. For two days we waited in un explainable worry....but thankfully he never showed! As soon as that stray hold was up our volunteers went and freed her. \n\nThis is also how we found Sugar Ray, sweet sweet Sugar Ray. (Click here to read his story - https://www.facebook.com/177799072926038/posts/523656111673664/?d=n) The same volunteer who posted about Hope told us about sugar Ray and begged us to save him too. When she showed us his face we couldn\u2019t say no, Hope lead us to Sugar Ray and Hope will forever carry a part of Sugar Ray with her. \n\nHope was seen by our texas veterinarians immediately. They checked all of her wounds, took x rays of her jaw, completed all tests and provided a treatment plan to get this sweet girl healthy! After 6 months of Heartworm treatment, and another 5 months of routine vet care including surgery on her jaw (the excess skin hanging from prior injury) she is finally ready to head to maine to find her furever home! \n\nHOPE IS\n\nApproximately 4 years old \nEnglish bulldog mix \nSpayed\nMicrochipped \nUp to date on vaccines \nNegative for Heartworm & tick borne diseases\nVery friendly and boisterous\nHas done well with male dogs but should be the only dog in the home \nShe would do well with kids over 12 due to her excitement and size \n\nClick here to apply - https://form.jotform.com/82708252435154\n",

My ID number is 336914\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated with a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Princess Starlight! While this little one is quite shy at the Shelter, once she is in a loving home, and comfortable, she will come out of her shell, revealing her very sweet nature and fun personality! Princess came from a home that she shared with several other dogs, and didn't seem to mind having a group of friends around. At such a young age, this pretty lady, has incredible potential to learn and grow into a successful new friend!\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption. \n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 34lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

She is a sweet girl who is very active, smart, and is a little shy.We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl once you gain her trust, she needs someone that is willing to spend time with her and gain her trust she is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

While Cassie is friendly with humans she is sometimes unsure of other dogs. This means that she likely needs to be the only dog in the home. Cassie qualifies for our foster-to-adopt program, which means you can take her home for 5 days to get to know her better before committing to adoption. During this time, the staff at HSVB will be available to help with any questions or concerns. If things don't work out, you'll be able to bring Cassie back to the shelter, judgement free.",

In fact, he'll fit easily into a home or an apartment. This boy is near perfect! Suba does everything exactly like he's supposed to. He isn't jumpy or loud. He loves affection and accepts attention gracefully without demanding more. His personality is gentle, but happy. He will make your day, every day! You couldn't ask for a better pup! Besides being handsome, and having a winning personality, Suba is also very well behaved. He's a dream on a leash. Walks with Suba are fun but tranquil! He already knows sit, and it's a surefire bet, that if he doesn't know more, he'll learn quicker than a second. If you're looking for a dog who'll ease in and become a part of your family, then Suba is your guy!",

He is about 3 years we think and found at a shelter in Idaho.  He is good with kids(though with herding dogs we prefer 8 and older) and he's been with cats.  If they don't run he won't chase.  He is housebroken and is getting used to being in a crate.  He also travels well in the car.   He is a bit of an escape artist but we wonder if that is due to that fact that he ws not neutered.  Hopefully the little surgery will help!  He is great of leash though!  He walks by your side even his foster says!  He was a bit skinny up on arrival but has had enough groceries now to help with that!  He weighs about 45#.   https://form.jotform.com/90797614942166",

The first step in our adoption process is to fill out an adoption application at www.snarrnortheast.org. PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO & FAQs BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Toto\n*Age: 4 months\n*Current Weight: 15 pounds\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $495 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: up to date on puppy shots so far (adopter will be responsible for remaining puppy vaccinations)\n\nToto and his littermates are arriving in New York soon and ready to meet their amazing new families and enjoy a whole new life.  They are an active bunch and love wrestling with each other.   Their mom is a small breed terrier mix around 25 pounds, we think the dad is a neighbor's dog  that's medium size probably a Australian shepherd/lab mix.  Another friendly dog in the house would be great for these cuties, an older playful canine sibling can teach them house manners and show them how to live the good life.  These puppies may be a little timid at first, when separated from their littermates, but we are sure that won't last long.  We can't wait for these guys to learn all about snow.  If you are looking for a handsome boy with energy and puppy kisses to give, maybe Toto is the pup for you.\n\nThis litter of adorable puppies was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. They will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on January 17th ready for adoption! \n\nIMPORTANT: This puppy has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nTo apply to adopt a puppy from this litter, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications.  \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\nWe do recommend listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice when applying for puppies with several littermates.\n(Littermates: )\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n",

Frosty is looking for a family that will be home with him during the day so he doesn\u2019t have to be alone. \nFrosty is a poodle so he will need regular groomings so keep this in mind before you apply to adopt. Groomings will cost between $50-$75 every 6-8 weeks. \n\nPlease have an excellent verifiable bet reference when applying to adopt. \n\nPrior to discussing our dogs we will need you to complete the Preliminary Adoption Application on our homepage at www.henryhumane.com.

Your typical Catahoula, he is cautious of new people but wants to trust. Based on his nature, he would make an incredible dog to grow up with respectful children of all ages. It may take him a few days to adjust to the energy of children, but Porthos doesn\u2019t have a bad bone in his body.\n\nPorthos is currently getting 4 long walks a day. He is a working breed so he will need structured walks throughout the day to ensure he is successful. As long as he\u2019s had enough exercise, he is extremely well mannered in the home. Porthos would also benefit from daily mental enrichment and structured outdoor activities!\n\nPorthos hasn\u2019t been left alone much in foster care, as he always prefers to be with his humans. So far he doesn\u2019t like his crate unless it\u2019s on his terms. He would prefer a home with at least one family member who is home more often than not. The one time he was left completely alone he destroyed his doggie tote out of anxiety. Transitioning him to a regular work day will take time and patience! Adopters should have a flexible schedule and some knowledge on separation anxiety to support him through it. Porthos prefers to sleep close to his humans on a doggy bed.\n\nOn leash Porthos is a puller. He is a powerful dog so he should never be walked by children, only strong handlers. His leash etiquette should be a primary focus for his training moving forward. He is quite skittish outside and will jump or startle easily to loud noises. He will also need support with basic obedience and commands.\n\nPorthos\u2019 ideal home would be a detached house, with a fully fenced backyard. He is used to wide open spaces to run and play, so would do best with a safely secured place to enjoy the outdoors. Porthos is only looking for homes outside of the city, where he can really start to thrive. Porthos craves the company of other dogs, so is looking for homes with at least one other well balanced dog in the home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Porthos please fill out an application at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/dog-adoption/\n\nPorthos\u2019 adoption fee is $800.

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Lauren T\nLocation: Foster\n\nThis sweet momma is Annie. Annie came to us just having given birth to 8 puppies! She is a very sweet and loving girl who deserves to be taken care of as well as she has her pups!\n\nAnnie is well housebroken and has medium energy, but it is hard to tell if that is her normal energy level, or if she is still resting up after taking such good care of her puppies. She's an incredibly sweet girl, but is startled by men. She will warm up to her current foster dad, but barks when she sees him in a new room. She has not exhibited aggression, but if there is a man in her household he will need to be patient with her to allow her time to trust him. \n\nShe is treat motivated and sleeps well throughout the night on her dog bed! \n\nShe will get a little anxious when left (paces, looking through the house for someone) but will settle down after a little while. She will do great with someone who can help her learn that its ok being left alone and that her person will always come back! \n\nShe knows basic commands like paw, sit, and down. She's a very smart girl. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog/puppy is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\n We also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

Has had some previous training as he does know sit, stay, down. He was locked in a shelter for 7 months and found his way on the euthanasia list! We couldn\u2019t let that happen! \nSo he made his journey to Illinois where he waits to find his forever home. He is slow to warm up and will need to be given space. He has shown resource guarding with food, toys, and blankets in new situations. He very much needs a place to feel safe and once he does those quirks have gone away. \nHe is 47.5 lbs and full grown. Potty trained and non destructive. He is not a dog that can be kenneled for he has a fear of them from being locked in one for 7 months! He has proven to be good with other animals but a meet and greet is mandatory. He warms up quicker to females and takes a little longer to warm up to men.",

She is completely potty trained, and does not destroy things when you are gone.\n\nRuby is  reactive towards other dogs, but as she is a smaller pitbull, she should be easy to handle for most. She has previously made fence-friends with neighbors dogs.\n\nRuby loves treats, dog toys and yard time! Photogenic, romantic, silly, and deserving!\n\nRuby currently lives in foster care and does amazing there. \n\nRuby is HW negative and on prevention, spayed, vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $275.\nApply for Ruby here: rebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

She is a Great Pyrenees and we highly recommend researching the breed before jumping in to get one. They are very striking dogs, noble, and kind to those they know. They prefer a home with land where they can roam and oversee their domain, however they shouldn't be left to free roam without a fence to keep them on the property. Livestock guardian breeds have a very large roaming range that often expands further than most single farm properties. Many GPs are indifferent to other dogs off their property. Mae is tolerant of other dogs. She prefers to have the companionship of people. She leans in and nudges for more petting, and would love nothing more than to find a family to cuddle her. \n\nMae was found stray in rural Ohio. She is undergoing treatment for tick-born illnesses and an ear infection that will most likely require surgery. Gigi's will cover the cost of the surgery and follow-up care. Follow-up care post surgery is very minimal, and she should be healed within 2-3 weeks after surgery. Mae is being offered as Foster-to-Adopt through her treatment and will be available for the foster family to adopt once she's cleared medically. She will also be spayed and receive a dental before being adopted. Mae is currently 83 pounds and approximately 3 years old.\n\nFor additional information about her medical status or inquiry about foster-to-adopting her, please email us: adopt@gigis.org",

Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

She is just an all-around nice dog who would do well with most active families.  \n\nThis pretty girl is so sweet and loves her people, whether it is cuddle time, play time or time for a run she\u2019s into it with you.  But as with all Husky\u2019s she can get into trouble if she is bored.  Keep her exercised every day and she will be the best companion ever!\n\nJuno does great with other dogs when given a proper introduction. She loves to play and would love a home with another playful dog. Her foster sisters are smaller than she is and she plays very appropriately. She can be intimidating to new dogs at first, so she should always be supervised with introductions. But she is actually on the submissive side and not aggressive at all when playing.\n\nShe needs some leash work, but will calm down once all the wiggles are out. She\u2019d do best in an active home with daily walks or other forms of exercise. We are told her favorite thing is to go on bike rides and run beside the bike. We have not had the opportunity to do that in her foster home. But exercise is especially important for her as she does have a bit of separation anxiety that can be helped with physical and mental activities.\n\nJuno is also kid and cat friendly. Because of her size though, she should go to a home with children over 8. She would not do well in a home where her family leaves her frequently for weekends away from home and activities. She wants nothing more than to hang with both her foster parents in a situation where she is comfortable. She\u2019s just a really great dog with nice manners and wants to please her people.\n\n",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys.\n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know that we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

Creole was born around October 2020 and is ready for a furever home! \n\nPart of the fun of adopting a puppy from an animal rescue is the surprise that comes along with their growth. Their size at adulthood is simply a guess and cannot be guaranteed. When you adopt a puppy from GPG, we trust that you will love and care for this animal regardless of their actual adult size and physical appearance.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Creole, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. \n\nFor more photos of Creole, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgCreole. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Both can be found under the Adopt menu item on the website. A veterinarian evaluates all dogs taken in by Mo-Kan Border Collie Rescue . All required shots are administered; checked for intestinal parasites; heart worms and they are spayed/neutered.\n\nDogs on the Sponsorship page may or may not be available for adoption yet, but can be Sponsored. Read more under the We Need You menu item on the website.\n\nCourtesy Listings have not been evaluated by MoKanBCR. Please refer to the contact info in the bio.\nMarshall is a 2 year old male smooth coat border collie looking for his forever home. Marshall is a snuggler and loves attention. He likes to go on hikes and play in the yard but he is also content to sit with the family on the couch to watch TV. He is great with other dogs. He solicits play well and can also take a hint if the other dog is not feeling equally playful. Good with both big dogs and little dogs, he likes to be near them but is respectful of their space.\n\nMarshall is house trained but does need to be let out frequently. He is currently crated while we are at work and left to roam the house overnight with the other dogs. He has not gotten into anything or chewed anything up. After being crated for several hours he can be rambunctious when he is let out again but taking him out to the yard to play right after seems to do the trick. He usually settles pretty quickly.\n\nMarshall is great with kids, he usually chooses to sleep in my children's bed at night (our bed is taken up by a very moody Frenchie). He is very good about leaving all their toys alone (their rooms are extremely messy). He would do best with children who are 6+ years old as he does sometimes put his paws up on them and could potentially knock over really little ones.\n\nHe does try to put his paws on people when he greets them but we are working to curb this behavior, he's doing well but does forget sometimes. He walks fairly well on the leash but will pull (also a behavior we are working on). I have not seen any leash reactivity towards people or other dogs. He has gone on several dog play dates and has done very well. He is bright and very food motivated.\n\nMarshall is a great dog! A pleasure to have in the house and so much fun. See the video of his great play behaviors, how he interacts with other dogs and our guests who he met for the first time that day, you can also see he is very athletic and he bounds around the yard. He's beautiful!\n\nMarshall is being fostered in the St. Louis, MO area.Click here to watch a video of Marshall.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

He is 2 to 3 years old. We found Clifford laying on the floor of a kill shelter near the Mexico border. He was crippled and could not walk so we rescued him and took him to our vet. We discovered that Clifford had two broken legs on opposite sides of his body. His x-rays were sent to a specialist who is an expert in plate repairs and he agreed that he could help Clifford. He has had his surgery and as you can see in the video, doing remarkably well! He will be released for full activity on Feb 8th and we can't wait to see him running full speed through the yard. He is friendly, and has been the perfect houseguest in his foster home. Clifford loves everyone so would make a great addition to any family. We are looking for the perfect home for this most perfect little dog. He is SO special!\n\nFor more on Cliffords story, please view our Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/TracysPawsRescue\n\n\nClifford is located in a wonderful foster home in San Antonio. We will arrange a time to meet Clifford once your application to adopt him has been approved. He is neutered, up to date on all shots, microchipped and his adoption fee is $300. If you would like to add Clifford to your family, please complete an application here-\n\nhttps://www.tracyspawsrescue.org/adoption-application\n\nServices our dogs receive prior to adoption:\nChagas Testing\nHeartworm Testing (age appropriate)\nTick Illness Testing (age appropriate)\nAll age appropriate vaccines\nHeartworm and flea/tick preventatives\nSpay/neuter surgery\nMicrochip\n\n* The breed(s) listed are guessed and based on the dog's physical appearance *",

On November 15th she gave birth to 5 beautiful puppies. On Jan 19th she was spayed. After weeks of healing we are ready to begin her heartworm treatment protocol. Which is a month of antibiotics and then 3 vet visits which are one injection One month. If you are local we have to have you use our vet for us to cover treatment 100%. \nPumpkin is about 1 1/2yr old, 25lbs and fully grown. Pumpkin Spice loves to cuddle all the time, has high toy drive loves to play & fetch. She is completely house broken. We have learned to sit and stay, she loves to learn each day. She's a doll on a leash. \nThere is not a mean bone in her body. She plays with our 5lb chiweenie to 40lb dogs in our home. Cats are up in air, she does love barking at them through fence. \nPumpkin is a puppy without all the hassles. Can be home for up to 8hrs, but would rather home bodies.\nApplication are @ Www.thewoofpack007tinyanimalrescue.org",

She's a super pretty 2 and a half year old Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler, Though timid by nature, Gretel's foster family reports that she is sweet and cuddly once she's gotten to know you. She also really LOVES being around other dogs, but she hasn't met any cats yet. Gretel's ideal home would have a big backyard where she can roll in the grass and chase squirrels - she is very fast! Treats and toys are also must haves for Gretel. She loves any toys that she can chase or will happily sit with a nice kong full of frozen peanut butter. Being so treat motivated and smart, Gretel has gotten really good at house manners and staying in her crate. We think she will do best in a more quiet home where she can really get comfortable with her people. Would you like to set-up a meeting with Gretel? Contact ARF, and we'll make it happen!",

Because I\u2019m not always a fan of dogs stealing attention from me or getting in my space, I cannot live in an apartment. Sorry! Hopefully my charm and love will make up for the fact that I want to be your only friend. I love to play ball outside and really like showing off for people. I have a lot of energy so if you have a yard I\u2019ll be sure to do laps around it. Pick me if you\u2019re looking for a sweetheart and me as your only pet. \n\n*no other dogs\n*no kids",

He now LOVES to play with his foster siblings and they have really given him confidence! He definitely needs a home with other dogs! Cola is approx 1 year old and about 45lbs. This boy will continue to be a project with gaining confidence. A quieter household will be best but the sky is the limit with how far he has come in just 2 weeks! He is fully vetted, house trained, crate trained and ready to roll. Please be prepared to continue his confidence building and leash work as he is still pretty scared away from home. This boy is going to be such a rewarding adoption. If you are interested in sweet Coal please fill out the application on our website finalvictoryrescue.com and if approved we will schedule a virtual meet and greet!",

She enjoys playing with stuffed animals and the bigger and squeakier ones are her favorite but when its time to relax Moety will join you on the sofa. Even though she is big she walks well on the leash for the most part. She enjoys riding in the car and she enjoys dressing up with her favorite kennel staff members. She will need an adult only home and has potential with the right dog but she would prefers them to be males.\n\nCan you envision this bundle of joy in your home, contact our adoption counselors at 234-212-9843 to learn more about Chester and how our adoption by appointment program works!",

            "description": "Big King came to us in September when a good Samaritan saw him get pushed out of a car. When King first arrived he was stressed and was looking for someone he could trust. King was looking for his knights in shining armor to show him the way. King found his knights and many royal subjects here at Lollypop Farm. King's knights went on many quests to prove to the king that there was compassion in the world, and that the world is not a scary place after all. King started to understand what his knight's and royal subject's were showing him. Thus he started to go on grand adventures. His favorite adventure is going on long hikes through the enchanted woods. \n\nAlas the time has come for the King to find his castle and his one true knight. King is looking for a calm and quiet castle. He is looking for an adult only castle with no other pets. If you think you might be the knight for King please reach out to nlapresi@lollypop.org for more information.",

            "description": "Susie is a 25 pound, 3 year old beagle that was surrendered with her sister Sunshine when they both flunked out of rabbit hunting school. While she is not going to give Elmer Fudd a run for his money, she most certainly could find a chicken nugget hidden in the house in 15 seconds flat! Susie walks nicely on the leash, and she is working on her potty training. She doesn\u2019t mind being crated and she is SUPER food motivated but doesn\u2019t have any food guarding issues. She will need regular exercise and to have her food intake carefully monitored because she would gladly eat her weight in dog food three times over daily. She really enjoys the company of other playful dogs so she would be happiest in a home with another dog (like her sister Sunshine). As is typical for a beagle, she will also follow an interesting scent anywhere so she will need a fenced yard or to remain on leash to keep her from  following her little nose off into far away places.\n\nThis dog is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested negative  for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $450 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.  This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05. \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!  If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

For additional information about him, please contact WASA by calling 203 557 0361 or by sending an email to wasa1@optonline.net.  WASA has a limited adoption area.  \n\nChili is an adorable and sweet senior (approximately 12) Merle Pomeranian.  He has been brought up to date on his vet care and is doing marvelously in is foster home.  We are looking for a relatively quiet home with an individual or family that have the time and resources to provide him with a wonderful life.  We would prefer a home where he is the only dog in residence but will consider a home where there is another small, chill senior dog (like the one currently residing in his foster home).  \n\nTo complete an online application (necessary prior to a meet and greet), please visit:  http://www.westportwasa.org/adopt/wasa-adoption-application/",
