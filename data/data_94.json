HPC will tell you all about my training so that you can carry on where they leave off. I\u2019m a 62 pound pup packed with high energy and very high intelligence. Both characteristics have gotten me into trouble . My shelter staff has taken this on as a challenge. You see I\u2019m an escape artist. I can climb any fence and remove toppers from kennels. Everyone is exercising my brain. Your imagination is the only limit. My mind must be worked . After an intense play session I\u2019m ready to spend quiet time with my folks. Training becomes a snap for the experienced handler. If you have an active lifestyle and would like to have a pal around for those midnight runs I\u2019m your guy.***I have been micro chipped.",

LEWIS walks well on his leash + harness, he loves to go for rides in the car & is very curious (yet somewhat guarded) about the world around him. One of his very fave things is exploring the Bosque with his person! .\n\nWe are seeking a Foster or FoReVeR home for LEWIS as an only Dog but he does enjoy having (supervised) playtime with his Doggie friends. LEWIS is looking for a loving & kind Hooman that will gently expose him to all of the good things life has to offer! He can be a little on the shy side at first but warms up quickly as soon as he knows he is safe with you. Someone with shy dog &/or Bully Breed experience is a plus! Cats are unknown but  we can cat test with an approved application! No human kids under 15 for LEWIS please. We want someone to lead LEWIS gently into the world because for a silly little Pittie like LOUIE...the world can be a big, scary place. Oh & when he barks, he sounds like he swallowed a squeaky toy :) But we think he will grow into his big boy bark someday! \n_____________________________________________\n\nAs an all volunteer, foster based, 501(c)3 non profit rescue, NMDOG is always in need of new, approved foster & adoptive homes in order to continue our Mission: to serve & protect New Mexico's Forgotten Dogs!! #UNchained \n\nIf you see a dog you are interested in that says \"in need of a foster home\", we are currently seeking a temporary foster home for that dog in order to provide them with the cozy & loving experience of a home environment while we work hard to find their forever family. This also frees up space & funds, which enables us to save another life. There is never a cost to foster for NMDOG & you will have the dedicated support of the NMDOG TEAM every step of the way. We take the time to really get to know the needs & personalities of our kids & we go the extra mile to ensure we make the best possible match...setting our dogs & their humans up for success! To learn more about the NMDOG Foster Program, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/foster\n\nOur adoption fee is $250 which includes; a 7 week NMDOG obedience/bonding class with your new Dog (classes are located in Abq & are also offered to our Foster Guardians at no charge), a complimentary vet wellness check & our dogs come with all of the supplies they need to get started on a trial adoption in their new home. All adopted dogs also receive free or discounted goodies & services from many of our awesome community partners!! Grooming, food, training, boarding, pet sitting & more.\n\nNMDOG doesn't cut any corners when it comes to the care & placement of our dogs. When a dog enters the NMDOG program, they are guaranteed to receive the very best of care. All of our available dogs have received a full medical & behavioral clearance prior to placement. They are (at the very minimum) spayed or neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed, Heartworm tested & currently on HW/flea & tick preventative. Due to the nature of our work, many of the dogs we rescue need much more extensive care before they are cleared for adoption. At NMDOG, we stand by our dogs for life & we make a promise to always be there for them (& their people) should they ever need us. .\n\nPlease contact us with your interest in becoming a treasured NMDOG Foster Guardian or FoReVeR Guardian Angel to one of our amazing dogs in need! Direct email contact for applications ~ TiffanyN@nmdog.org \nWe look forward to hearing from you & answering any questions you may have. WooF!!\n",

He will be better with a family that has children 10 years old or older.  We are working with him on housebreaking.  He gets along great with other small dogs.  He loves to run, play and jump.  He is learning what toys and treats are.  CLYDE has had a very, very rough 2020.  He needs a family that will give him some to time to trust and love them on his time frame.  He will be your buddy for life then. \n\nHe came to Izzy's Place from an animal abuse case in Wyoming with 4 other male chihuahua's.  They had been left to die in a locked uhaul in wyoming in the middle of winter.  They then spent 5 months in a shelter as evidence for court.  Finally they came into rescue in July 2020 and are doing awesome.\n\nSo open your Heart and Home for CLYDE and you will never regret it.  Contact Izzy's Place to adopt this little guy.",

He will be better with a family that has children 10 years old or older.  We are working on him with housebreaking.  He gets along great with other small dogs.  He loves to run, play and jump.  He is learning what toys and treats are.  BULLWINKLE  has had a very, very rough 2020.  He needs a family that will give him some to time to trust and love them on his time frame.  He will be your buddy for life then. \n\nHe came to Izzy's Place from an animal abuse case in Wyoming with 4 other male chihuahua's.  They had been left to die in a locked uhaul in wyoming in the middle of winter.  They then spent 5 months in a shelter as evidence for court.  Finally they came into rescue in July 2020 and are doing awesome.\n\nSo open your Heart and Home for BULLWINKLE and you will never regret it.  Contact Izzy's Place to adopt this little guy.",

He is learning what toys and treats are.  PACO has had a very, very rough 2020.  He needs a family that will give him some to time to trust and love them on his time frame.  He will be your buddy for life then. \n\nHe came to Izzy's Place from an animal abuse case in Wyoming with 4 other male chihuahua's.  They had been left to die in a locked uhaul in wyoming in the middle of winter.  They then spent 5 months in a shelter as evidence for court.  Finally they came into rescue in July 2020 and are doing awesome.\n\nSo open your Heart and Home for Paco and you will never regret it.  Contact Izzy's Place to adopt this little guy.",

She just finished her basic training. She knows place, sit, go, here. She is crate trained. Smarest girl ever.\nKatie runs with the pack (or more accurately, runs the pack) she is definitely an alpha personality. She is German Shepherd and Cattle Dog. Two working breeds that need a job and a lot of stimulous. She goes non stop and keeps everyone on their toes. She will be a great running companion once she is a bit older.\nShe is a talker and lets you know when there is an issue. If that is a puppy in the wrong crate, a puppy on the couch or, the group playing to rough - She has a lot to say.\nSmart! She is potty trained. Does not soil her crate, figured out the doggie door weeks before I would have approved, but there is no stopping her when she sets her mind to learning something.\nShe sits for treats. Not because she was trained to, but because she watched the pack and learned. She is going to be an exceptional dog given the right owner.\nShe requires an active home. Because of her intelligence, she will become bored and then destructive which will not make anyone happy. Katie is a pleaser and learns very quickly.\n\nHer perfect home will be older children, an active family and definitely a yard. Katie will do best with a companion dog in the family. She is not an apartment dog. She has 2 speeds, full out or asleep. If you think you can provide Katie with the stimulous and love that she will require, she will be an awesome dog.\n\n=========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He is a fun and loving dog once he gets to know you.  His favorite toy is a purple tennis ball.  Yes, he knows the difference between them and it has to be his purple one.  He does need to be the only pet in the house and no children.  Murphy is heartworm negative, has current vaccinations, and is neutered.  His adoption fee is $275.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

He can be a little shy starting off, but warms up quickly. He doesn\u2019t like sudden moves or being grabbed at so a home with older children would be best. He would also like to be the only pet. He is up to date on vaccines, neutered and microchipped. He tested negative for Heartworm and has been kept on Heartgard and Frontline. His adoption fee is $200 plus 6% KY sales tax.

PLEASE FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, ONCE PRE-APPROVED, GIVE US A CALL AND WE CAN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO MEET ME!\n\nI am 44 lbs., 4 years old, and l am looking for my forever home.\n\nAdoption Donation: $350\n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus; Vectra 3D.\n\nAll household members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available.  As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Once she's warmed up, she is very playful and loving with her people. She is still wary of strangers and would do best in a low traffic home with no children. Bella cannot be around small dogs and has displayed some jealousy issues with dogs her size, so may do best as the only pet in the home. She will reward you with lots of snuggle time.

PLEASE FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, ONCE PRE-APPROVED, GIVE US A CALL AND WE CAN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO MEET ME!\n\nI am 44 lbs., 3 years old, and l am looking for my forever home.\n\nAdoption Donation: $350\n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus; Vectra 3D.\n\nAll household members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available.  As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "Brandy is a 3-1/2-ish-year-old Hound mix weighing in at about 50 lbs. who was dumped on a back country road. Lucky for her, a Good Samaritan found her and she became a Big Fluffy. \n\nBrandy holds no grudges and is super sweet.  Brandy is good with lower key dogs as she prefers to be the queen of her home.  No cats for Brandy. She is a dream on a leash, so she would be a great walking buddy. She can be mouthy when she gets excited, so we think teens and up would be best.  Brandy is looking for someone that can give her lots of exercise and continue her training and give her a comfy and loveable home to live out her years to come.  Brandy will also need a tall fenced yard or someone dedicated to lots of leash walking.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ then email Debbie@BigFluffyDogs.com\n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Came to us after her family wanted to euthanize her after she went down because of IVDD She had surgery and has gotten physical therapy from her amazing foster mom and she is walking (a little wobbly, but effective and she has full bowel and bladder control)\n\nBexley is a sweet girl with all people. She would love a family where she was an only dog. She will tolerate some other dogs, but is the best she can be when it\u2019s just her in a home. \n\nIf you are interested in moving forward with the dog above, you are welcome to fill out an application on our website (www.dachshundrescuesouthflorida.com) which we will process to find out a bit more about what kind of doxie would be a good match for your home.  We ask potential forever homes to fill out an application as the first step in moving forward with any of our dogs for three reasons:\n\n -  We process all applications before making any introductions so we can help ensure people will be good home and have the right environment for a doxie\n\n-  Asking potential families to fill out an application helps us ensure we are utilizing our efforts working with those who are serious about adopting\n\n - Lastly, this process minimizes visitors and interruptions to our foster homes for without whom, we would not be able to operate!\n \nPlease join us on Facebook as well to see the day to day operations of our rescue; www.facebook.com/dachshundrescuesouthflorida\n",

This sweet baby girl has been through some trauma in her short life, and is ready to see how good life can be! Emma is happy and active, but needs help with her day-to-day activities due to some back leg paralysis. It is uncertain whether her paralysis is permanent at this point, but she is content to use her wheels to motor around for now. All she asks of her humans is to help her with going potty, follow up with her physical therapy, and give her plenty of love! Miss Emma loves to cuddle, play with her toys, and chew on bones. Since she has been busy learning to use her wheels, she hasn't had as much time to socialize with other dogs. She will need slow introductions with other dogs and playtime with gentle dogs due to her current condition. She seems very curious about cats, so they may not make the best roommates or will need very slow introductions. This silly girl is looking for an adult family that knows what it is like to rely on others for help. She needs the time and patience to trust those that will allow her to be her happiest! Are you ready to give Miss Emma the TLC she needs? Her foster family is ready to share what a day in the life of Emma is like. Come meet this sweet soul!",

Having previously lived in a home, she does have some basic training under her paws. Bella has done well with the dogs we have introduced her to but needs firm, strong handler experience and a home with no other dogs for now. Bella would be a great companion for an experienced, active home, due to her size and energy a home with space for her to romp and play is most ideal.\nDue to her size and energy, a home with children under fifteeen would not be an ideal match for Bella.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\n\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed. An application, home check, contract and adoption fee are required for all adoptions. All dogs will be, or required to be, spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped before adoption. Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\n\nAdoption fees vary between $400 - $500 for puppies 8 weeks - 5 years, $350 6 - 9 years and $300 for dogs over 9 years. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip, a wellness check, any additional medical expenses necessary and of course all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\n\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\n\nFor additional information or questions, please email us at info@muttmatchla.org. To submit an application, please visit us at www.muttmatchla.org. Mutt Match L.A. is an all volunteer rescue, please allow at least 48 hours for a returned response of all inquires.\n\nThank you!

I just need a chance! I recently went to an adoption event with a bunch of other dogs at a brewery and I did awesome! I've come a long way since I got to Corridor Rescue! \n\nTex is an intelligent boy who just needs a chance to show you what he can do. He does have big dog syndrome, in that he absolutely forgets how big he is at times. He has had big dog friends at the kennel, although a meet 'n' greet is needed. This boy is young and fit and smart and has waited far too long for his happily ever after. Could you be it??\n\n*** \nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org \n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines. \n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

The ladies at the kennel keep calling me cute. I mean, come on. I'm 4 now. I'm an adult. I'm handsome. \n\nI am a fun guy! Some say a little rambunctious, so I shouldn't be with kids under 12 AND I need an experienced dog owner home, but with a little time, training and freedom (this kennel life is for the birds), I think I'm gonna be just fine!\n\nKnight is a big boy who has grown up quite a bit in the time he's been rescued, but still needs an experienced owner. He has played with one other large dog at the kennel, but he is dog selective and a meet 'n' greet is necessary if there is a dog in the home already. And, although he definitely does enjoy his friend, he would be perfectly fine as the only dog in the home.\n\n*** \nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org \n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines. \n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

He's mellow and enjoys lounging in a sunny spot, hanging out with his human friends and going on short walks. He won't bother you much unless you let him know you are ready for a round of tug-of-war, then he happily accepts the challenge. He also enjoys modeling on the side, becoming the inspiration for Corridor Rescue's logo. \n\nHe has made friends with a couple of female dogs at our kennel, but his all-time favorite girl is Odessa. They were seen together for years on the street, and reunited about a year after Bo was rescued. Bo and Odessa share a kennel the majority of the time at Corridor and would be happiest being adopted together.\n\nBo is a well behaved guy and keeps his room neat and clean. He knows sit, stay and will come when you call his name off leash. He loves to do tricks for treats, of course. His favorite commands are sit and shake. \n\nBo does have some arthritis, but still enjoys life to the fullest. We would love for him and Odessa to have a forever home in their golden years. Relaxing on couches, playing tug-of-war in the yard and knowing the safety and love that comes with a forever home.\n\n*** \nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org \nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $125 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines. \n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

I'm a bigger gal, but that does not stop me from crawling on your lap or laying my big, ol' head there for a nice scratch behind the ear. Due to my love of affection and my chill demeanor, the staff really like me, if I do say so myself.\n\nIf you think you'd be interested in having a 75 pound cuddle bug in your home, don't hesitate! I'm generally cool with big dogs my size (meet 'n' greets are a must), but I'm absolutely OK with being the only furry one in the family also. I'm flexible like that.\n\nInca cannot be in a home with small dogs, cats or kids younger than 12. She is a wonderful girl who really just wants to wander around the yard, scratch her back on the cement, get some attention from her people, and nap.\n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org \n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines. \n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

            "description": "**This dog is with Corridor Rescue in Houston, Texas**\n\nLike a lot of our rescue pups, we're not exactly sure what breed Harry is, but we do know this goofy playful boy is a ton of fun! He's quickly become a staff favorite with his happy personality. Harry loves all the people and has done great in all his doggie playgroups.\n\nHarry requires a strict vegetarian diet and allergy shots. He struggled with allergies for a long time, but he's finally found something that works, and it shows! Harry is a happy guy and his coat is all grown in; which was something that was lagging behind in his recovery due to the allergies.\n\nHarry is now in a foster home and, as expected, he's doing awesome. He lives with 4 dogs and 4 cats. He also comes into contact with donkeys and horses and chickens and does well with all of them, also.\n\nHarry is an amazing dog, but there are a few considerations with adopting him. He will need to be under the care of a veterinary dermatologist likely for life. If he has anything that's not on his strict diet, he will have an allergic reaction, causing a trip to the dermatologist. This is also a reason we do not believe Harry will do well in a home with children. As almost everyone knows, kids unintentionally (and sometimes intentionally) drop things on the floor, leave toys laying around, etc. And not only is Harry susceptible to allergic reactions, he is also susceptible to eating things he shouldn't. He's already had surgery to remove a rope toy he found somewhere from his stomach. He cannot have any toys, but can have Nylabone-type toys WITH SUPERVISION as he likes to chew. Harry's allergies require prescription food, prescription allergy injections and prescribed medicated baths. This will very likely be for life.\n\nHe is 100% worth all of this. He's a wonderful dog who loves his people and he's very easy to love. \n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member",

I'm an athletic, anxious boy and would do best with someone who is home most of the time. I do not like to be alone. I am what they call a \"sensitive soul.\"\nIf there is another dog in the home, there MUST be a meet 'n' greet. Davis will only do well with a very laid back, passive dog as he feeds off another dog's emotions. He would do best as the only dog in the home. \nHe is a very loving boy and really just wants to make his people happy and to be with them as much as possible.\n\nI like dogs, I like cats (the lazy ones only), I like hanging out, I like walks. I do have energy to spare, so a home with people who really like to spend time with me would be great. I have some learning to do, but I am willing to listen and I can't wait to show my people what a good boy I can be.\n\nI'm a pretty easy guy to get along with! If you'd like to see that for yourself, fill out an application to meet me! I'd love to meet you!\n\nDavis has separation anxiety and would do best in a home where someone is with him the majority of the day or is able to have someone come over and let him out or bring him to doggie daycare. He loves his people and will sit in laps, on feet, etc., to keep you near. He also very much prefers to sleep in bed with his people.\nHe's a very sweet, sensitive, athletic boy who will require time, energy and patience, but the love that comes back will be more than worth it. He has flourished in his foster home with his human parents and furry siblings. We can't wait to see what he does in his forever home.\n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

I'm still at the kennel, looking for a home with my forever home with my best boy, Bo! \n\nI was rescued in March 2018, after living on the streets for years. Once at the kennel, it took me a minute to warm up to the staff, but it wasn't too long before I figured out that the rescued life is a much better life to be living. Soon, they introduced me to Bo, who I had hung out on the streets with for a long time. It was so fun to see him! He's pretty much the only dog I like.\n\nBo and I like to go for walks, play tug-of-war, and nap. Bo & I both have arthritis, so our walks are short and our play sessions aren't as long as they used to be either. But that's OK! There's one other thing I really like--CAR RIDES! Yep! A good ol' Sunday drive really makes me happy. \n\nOne thing I am not a fan of is thunderstorms. I need some comfort to get through the storms...they really freak me out. \n\nPlease consider adopting some oldies, but goodies! Bo and I really want a good home together to live out the rest of our days.\n\n*** \nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org \nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\nThe adoption fee of $125 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines. \nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis. Thank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

He has bonded with Betty and has become more approachable. He now takes treats from the hand. Betty just went to a foster home, and this may help him to transfer his trust to humans. \nTommy is a beautiful dog who does want to lose his fear of humans. He looks at you with such hope. If a potential adopter could spend regular time with him, he could become that affectionate, grateful dog to his special human.\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.",

Please understand that this is a process, and it may take some time to both review and process your application, as well as to potentially adopt one of our Labs. One of the reasons that we ask for an application fee ($25) is that it takes the limited resources and time of our Trustees and volunteers to thoroughly review and process your application.\u00a0(This fee is deducted from the adoption fee when you adopt.)\n\nPlease be patient; and be respectful of the volunteers and fosters that will work with you through this process. No one is paid, it is a labor of love, and we do our best to respond to applications and inquiries in a timely manner.\u00a0\n\nThat said, there is a reason that we ask applicants to specify the name of a dog in our application. With limited\u00a0resources, we\u00a0want to make sure that we are processing applications that will result in a successful adoption of one of our Labs in need. We cannot guarantee that you will be able to adopt the specific Lab that you are inquiring about. We always have more qualified applicants than we have Labradors available for adoption.\u00a0\n\nOur job, and most especially the job of our fosters, is to place their dogs with the adopters that are the best fit for that specific Lab, and will offer them the best chance for success. If the Lab you originally applied for is adopted to someone else, please don't take it personally; and remember that we are always bringing in new Labs in need. One of them may very well be the perfect fit for your home.\u00a0\n\nYour patience and understanding of our process is very much appreciated. Thank you!",

            "description": "Meet Toby! He is one fun-loving dude with an incredible zest for life. Toby loves to play and have adventures, but he is equally as happy to snuggle up and chill. He is incredibly food motivated and won\u2019t hesitate to remind you it\u2019s mealtime. Toby has a goofball personality and loves to make you laugh. He is also an exceptionally talented soccer player and would like to continue to work on this skill in his new home. \n\nIn Toby\u2019s short life he has already had several homes and been handed some bad luck. He does have a bite history due to a fear based reaction to a scary situation he was in. He is nervous in some situations and needs guidance to build his confidence and help him learn how to act in situations he\u2019s unsure of. He is a dog that learns incredibly quickly and craves boundaries and structure. If he is provided the stability he needs, he will continue to flourish into the well balanced and good boy that he is.  \n\nToby\u2019s ideal home is a calmer setting where he can be his adopter\u2019s \u201conly child\u201d. Although he is dog social, he would do best in a dog free home to ensure he is setup for success. He needs a firm and experience handler who can give him boundaries and routine. Playing with other dogs is very exciting and he would love to have play dates with other large, well-mannered dogs outside of the home. A home with cats or children won\u2019t be suitable for Toby. \n\nTo apply to adopt Toby, please visit our website at: https://newcollar.co/adopt-a-dog",

He loves to meet new people, and is great with other dogs. He is house and crate trained and loves to sleep with his human when allowed. Harley can be a ball of energy and loves attention, giving kisses and playing with toys - especially the ones built for chewing like you get in bully box. Harley also has a calm and quiet side. He likes to kick back and relax on his cot for some chill time - this boy sure loves his naps! His foster mom said he is the easiest foster she has ever had (that's sayin' somethin'!).\n\nAlthough Harley is heartworm positive, he is undergoing accelerated slow kill protocol, where he should test negative in Spring 2021. He is otherwise healthy with the exception of an occasional slight limp from an apparently old injury - but it sure doesn't slow him down! He's up to zoomies and playtime, any time! \n\nIf you would like to meet Harley, please go to www.newbestfriend.org and submit an adoption application. Our adoption fee is $250+sales tax and includes neuter, vaccinations and microchip.\n\nNOTE: We do not adopt outside the Greater Houston Metroplex.",

Canelo's DOB is 10/23/2019; he is a puppy with lots of energy. He would do well with an active family so he can get regular exercise. We are working with him, and, as with all puppies, Canelo will need to continue training once he is in his new home. With a little patience and a lot of love, he is destined to be the best dog ever! Canelo is good with people and dogs but will probably do best with bigger dogs and kids.\nCanelo is a 10-month-old Jack Russell Terrier mix and weighs 34 pounds. He is neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, and takes preventative flea/tick/heartworm medicine.\nAs with all our dogs, Canelo must be an indoor dog.\nIf you are interested in adopting Canelo, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com.",

            "description": "Amora is a pit bull terrier/boxer/american bulldog mix, is 4-5 years old and weighs approximately 60 pounds. Gunner is a purebred cane corso and turned 5 years old on October 24th, 2020. He is a BIG DOG and weighs 120 pounds. He is a gentle giant and not a jumper. Both are active and playful, but do have their calm moments. They like to play tug-of-war with each other and their humans. Neither growl or nip if you take away toys or food. Amora LOVES to swim and would do well in a home with a pool. Gunner prefers to stay out of the water. Amora also likes to play fetch. They are very smart pups and have learned a few commands. Amora knows: come, stay, go outside, leave it, sit. Gunner knows: go outside, leave it, sit. Amora is fully house-broken and working on leash-training. Gunner is working on house-training with the assistance of Amora, but will need time, effort and patience from his adopters to complete it. He also requires a bit of patience to learn what he can and cannot chew: lots of toys will help! He is not leash-trained due to his size and strength. There are so many amazing things about Gunner: he adapts to your energy very easy, he is caring, his is alert, does not bite, loves feet, he is truly the best kind of friend. Both are good with kids and very sweet and loving with their family. Amora is as loyal as can be. She is a well behaved dog and she is great with kids and guests. She is protective and alert, very active, house broken. She always aims to please her humans. She is dog selective and does not get along with small animals or other large breed females. She does perfectly with Gunner and he's all she wants in a canine companion! Gunner is good with other dogs and, despite his size and strength, he is quite submissive to other canines. He is not a very confident dog and is a bit timid. His sister's confident, outgoing personality perfectly balances out his own. Amora and Gunner would make a wonderful pair to a home looking for a couple of goofy, gentle, loving large breed buds. They really adore each other and howl/cry whenever they are apart. Their adoption fee as a pair is $685 and covers the costs of spay/neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchips and microchip registrations. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

Gunner is working on house-training with the assistance of Amora, but will need time, effort and patience from his adopters to complete it. He also requires a bit of patience to learn what he can and cannot chew: lots of toys will help! He is not leash-trained due to his size and strength. There are so many amazing things about Gunner: he adapts to your energy very easy, he is caring, his is alert, does not bite, loves feet, he is truly the best kind of friend. Both are good with kids and very sweet and loving with their family. Amora is as loyal as can be. She is a well behaved dog and she is great with kids and guests. She is protective and alert, very active, house broken. She always aims to please her humans. She is dog selective and does not get along with small animals or other large breed females. She does perfectly with Gunner and he's all she wants in a canine companion! Gunner is good with other dogs and, despite his size and strength, he is quite submissive to other canines. He is not a very confident dog and is a bit timid. His sister's confident, outgoing personality perfectly balances out his own. Amora and Gunner would make a wonderful pair to a home looking for a couple of goofy, gentle, loving large breed buds. They really adore each other and howl/cry whenever they are apart. Their adoption fee as a pair is $685 and covers the costs of spay/neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchips and microchip registrations. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

I'm a little nervous around new dogs, but once I get to know them, I want to be best friends!  \nI was rescued with my 2 babies from the hot and dangerous streets, so I am almost healed up from severe mange - so glad those days are over!\nI am currently living with 12 dogs, and we are having a great time playing together!\nNot to brag, but my foster mom said that I am so beautiful and sweet.  I really love hugs and kisses!  If you talk to me, I wag my tail really hard and roll over for belly rubs!  \nI'm patiently waiting to meet a family that I can call my own. \n\nThis is a courtesy post for an independent rescuer.\nPLEASE CONTACT THE FOSTER DIRECTLY \nDenisse at:\nRescuedog36@gmail.com\nor fill an application at:\n\nhttps://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAADAV2WtUQzdJVjY0NTU2Wk1aMVJBWk9BM1g5TU9LWS4u\n\nThanks for your interest in adopting a rescue dog!",

BeBe needs time to warm up to you and someone who understands the Chihuahua breed and will work on training and being the pack leader. BeBe would do well in a home with no children and with someone who can be patient and do some training. If you would like to make BeBe a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org.\nBEBE'S ADOPTION FEE IS $170. The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Meet Pup Pup! He needs a special person, but he knows you're out there. We know it too! Pup Pup is pretty fearful with new people, especially men. He is also handshy. Pup Pup needs you to go slowly it is worth it once you've won him over! That's exactly what shelter staff and volunteers did with Pup Pup: took it slowly. Didn't rush things. Made sure he was comfortable with them. Watched his body language. Gave him LOTS of treats! And now Pup Pup has some shelter BFFs, including men, who look forward to spending time with him. Once you're in Pup Pup's inner circle, he acts like, well, a dog! He plays fetch, runs around with his toys, checks in with you for affection (and treats!). And you know that y'all's relationship is the real deal when he rolls over to ask for a belly rub. Pup Pup needs an adopter willing to take the time to get to know him. That means multiple visits at the shelter to start creating that bond. Someone who recognizes that he will always need slow, repeated introductions with new people. Someone who understands that he has been through a lot in his short life and who wants to help him heal and thrive. Pup Pup needs a pet-free home that is adult-only and low-traffic. Pup Pup appears to be house trained but may need a little refresher course in a new home. Pup Pup may always remain cautious and fearful with strangers. He will go home with tons of support from the Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at the shelter), a goody bag of enrichment items, and free training support thanks to Friends of AAC and their Behavior Assistance Program!

She appears to have a lot of German Shepard in her and is super smart, energetic and absolutely loves the people she trusts. She can be fearful, intimidated and nervous around people she is unfamiliar with and needs an experienced owner to help her become more well socialized. Due to her lacking some basic social skills, we feel she should not go to a home with any children. A patient owner who can also help her by working with a trainer and managing her fear of new people would be a great match for Ripley. With her trusted people she is often cuddly, affectionate and loves to curl up on your lap as if she were the size of a Chihuahua. She also can't get enough hugs and belly rubs!\nRipley has a difficult time making dog friends because she just doesn't realize her own size and strength; but not in an aggressive way. So if she goes to a home with another dog, she will need two onsite visits at TVR before being adopted to make sure everyone gets along. Ripley seems to prefer male dogs and can be a handful and too rowdy for some dogs to play with so she shouldn't go to a home with a puppy or small dogs. She's a bit of a Tomboy! \n\nIf you're an experienced dog owner looking for an active, smart and affectionate best friend, Ripley might just be the companion you've been waiting for!",

She is very shy at first, as she's had a VERY hard life prior to being rescued! She just needs a little time to trust and a chance! She has the sad eyes look and has had a rough life in the past. Fendi would do best in a home with older children, a home that just lets her RELAX, her favorite thing to do! She would also do best with dogs her size or larger, not smaller dogs. She came to us pregnant, severally emaciated and underweight and due to the stress of the animal control, went into premature labor and lost all of her babies. She would have been an amazing Momma! Fendi so deserves to find her forever family after everything she's been through. Is that with you? Adoption fee is $175. Apply at www.straypawsrescue.com",

That\u2019s no place for any dog to be, let alone a youngin. He\u2019s young, goofy, had absolutely no manners, and needs to grow into his legs. Basically, he\u2019s a perfect crazy puppy!\n\nEDUCATION:\n* Sit\n* Down\n* Stay\n* Leave it\n* Come\n* Paw\n* Touch\n* Crate trained\n* House trained\n* He knows 'show me' and he'll play bow at the things he wants like bowing at shoes for walks, the door for potty breaks, and the water bowl for a refill\nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS:\n* Treats: not picky and he loves carrots\n* Food: he'd like eggs and spinach, please\n* Toys: Westpaw brand toys, bones, Chuck-It balls\n* Walks: superstar on leash and he likes his walks, don't forget ?\n* Sleeping\n* Playing\n* Chewing on stuff\n* Playing tug\n* Fetch\n* Head and ear rubs\n\nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: friendly\n* Kids: overexcited, he doesn't realize how big he is, we recommend ages 10+\n* People: friendly, overexcited\n* Cats: unknown\n\nCHALLENGES:\n* Not a fan of the regular vacuum but the Roomba is ok\n* Normal puppy behaviors like chewing, jumping, and mouthiness\n* Not a fan of getting his nails clipped or his ears cleaned, he just needs 2 people and treats to get the job done",

Click on \"More About Us\" for the link to the form. Any inquiries/questions sent without the completed form will NOT receive a response. Thank You for understanding.\nChip is a very active, playful, cuddly 3 year old Min Pin/Chihuahua (\"Chi-Pin\") mix boy who will never leave you lonely or bored.  He is weighs 10 lbs. and is very friendly, feisty, and independent with an entertaining personality. Chip is a very brave little boy who will protect you at all costs if the need arises.  With Chip around you will be loved like never before in your life.   He is great with all other dogs and wants to play with the cats so bad. Chip can also entertain himself very nicely so he could be fine as the only pet.  Chip only has one quirk and that is he does not like little kids poking at him (under the age of 10).  If you are ready for a funny, lively, entertaining, loyal, true-blue buddy, Chip is the guy for you! Good things come in small packages, and Chip is very affectionate, playful, smart, and funny.  He loves to be held or sit in your lap and will fall asleep while you are petting him.  He loves to play with stuffed toys and will entertain himself---it's hilarious!  Chip will follow you everywhere and jump up and down like a pogo stick when he wants you to pick him up.  He loves to be loved on! His adoption fee of $150 includes his spay/neuter, shots, and microchip.  Chip is leash trained and doggie door trained.",

The nice people from Big Dog Ranch Rescue saved me from a South Carolina animal shelter and I am super happy to be here and meet my forever family.I am a good looking pup looking to get out and have some fun. I am finally out of that annoying puppy stage and have learned some basic skills, but I would really benefit from obedience training. Obedience training is a great way for us to bond and will teach us those cool commands like: sit, stay, come, down, etc. that will help make me an A++ canine companion. My previous owner did not give me monthly heart worm prevention and now I am heart worm positive. The nice people here at BDRR are providing me with the life saving heart worm treatment which will make me healthy again. The Adoptions staff can tell you all about the treatment process and how it will be imperative that I remain on heart worm preventative each and every month going forward (It's not that expensive and heck I am worth it!).",

            "description": "Meet SADIE,\n\nShe is a precious girl but a little shy.  It does take her a little bit to warm up but once she is comfortable, she does fine; she LOVES to play with her toys and can entertain herself very well.  This sweet girl loves affection, lounging on the bed and getting lots of cuddles and belly rubs. She does well with big dogs but not littles.\n\nSadie does well on leash but can get a little over stimulated when meeting new dogs or people but is getting better and better as she is becoming more confident. She definitely needs to lose some weight so someone who wants to go for walks will be great.\n\nSadie would do best in a quiet home with an experienced dog owner.  We believe she was used for breeding and then discarded.  She deserves to spend the rest of her life being loved unconditionally and spoiled, spoiled, spoiled.\n\nIf you are interesting in applying for sweet Sadie girl, please go to our website at www.aarflove.org and complete our application form.\n\n** Please note that due to the amount of applications we have been receiving for all of our pets, we CANNOT respond to every application.  If we think Sadie would be a good fit for you, one of our volunteers will reach out.",

We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 1.5 hours driving distance.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, foster, or aid in the rescue efforts of RARE!",

Henry isn't afraid to get out in the great outdoors and explore with his nose to the ground! A child free household would be Henry's perfect living situation as he does struggle with food and bowl guarding- this spoiled baby was never taught to share! Henry is a delight to be around, his goofy personality never fails to bring a smile to our face! This happy boy really loves attention and will roll over to get it! After a long walk, Henry loves to relax in the shade under a bush and just chill out! Henry would truly thrive with an experienced adopter who would be understanding and patient with him as he adjusts to life in his forever home. \n\nCome on over and see what a ham Henry truly is.

Kay has never had the chance at a normal life as a loved family member and needs someone that is understanding of this, patient, confident, and wanting to give her everything she\u2019s never had before - a loving, stable home. Kay loves her food and will take it gently out of your hand. She is trying very hard to learn how to be a confident dog! \nSweet Kay requires a fenced in yard to truly thrive.\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

Sadly my owner's health failed and I had to find a new home which is how I came to BDRR. I am not a fan of small dogs but I do well with people of all ages. I adore being petted and when given the chance I will lean right into you for a little affection. I am very good walking on a leash. Honestly, I could use a few more steps every day to work on my figure. I am house trained. I truly would be a nice addition to a loving and caring home. Adopt Don't Shop!",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility..\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Please apply at bfdaaa.com Shiloh is still searching for a quiet, adult only home where he can enjoy going for long or short walks, run in a fenced-in yard, or just snuggle by your side and watch the world go by. He is best with an experienced owner as your only pet and prefers to be in a home with women. Well, we guess he is simply a ladies man! Shiloh is less trusting of men. He can be fine with men with slow introduction. Poor boy who knows what his life was like before but we know that there is a loving home out there for this handsome guy. He is best in a quiet, single-family home. The apartment life is too busy for him. Shiloh is fully housebroken, crate trained, good on a leash, takes toys, treats food gently, knows several commands, and is wondering when his chance will come at a loving, quiet, adult home? Can you be Shiloh's hero? He is 6 yrs. old sweetheart down on his luck. Saved by Best Friend Dog and Animal Adoption, Inc. and Best Friend Thrift Shop from a local New Jersey shelter where he waited a long time to be rescued. Now, Shiloh is in his kennel in Stirling, N. J. waiting for you to adopt him. Please apply to adopt Shiloh at bfdaaa.com and email bestfrienddogadopt@gmail.com for more information. If your application is a possible match, a volunteer will get back to you within 72 hours. Here is Shiloh in his newest video https://youtu.be/U7xzqO2r8bU and here is another very recent video https://youtu.be/RZ1TN5geu8U",

            "description": "Queena was relinquished to us due to the owner needing to move in with her daughter after a change in her health condition. Based on Queena's surrender questionnaire, she is good with all dogs, good with kids (was around kids ages 3, 9 and 12), and is house-trained. She does not like cats or car rides (she gets car sick and took Dramamine for longer rides with her former family).\n\nWe have found that Queena understands the \"sit\" command in Spanish. We are working on the English version.\n\nQueena has a congenital heart issue and has plaques on her eyes. These are issues that were identified when her former owner first took Queena to a vet after finding her a couple of years ago. Queena's medical intake with us for us to get more information is pending.\n\nShe is new to our rescue and we are learning more about her.\n\nIf interested in Queena, please complete our adoption application at our website here: https://lastchanceatlife.org/adoptable-pets/dog-adoption-application/",

He loves to be snuggled and will be more than happy to return the loves. \n\nUnfortunately, for some reason Rex has a slight neurological issue causing him to have balance issues. Essentially he walks like a drunken sailer, but he\u2019s so much cuter! For this reason, Rex needs a secure home where he feels safe and loved. He needs to have the confidence that the other animals in the home will not knock him off balance or try to hurt him. Puppies make him nervous, as well as dominant or hyper dogs. Which if i had his disability, I\u2019d be the same way. Because of this he needs to be in a home with other calm, cool and collected pups. \n\nRex\u2019s adoption fee is $200. This adoption fee helps to cover some of his vetting. Vetting include his DA2PPv, bordetella, and rabies vaccinations, deworming, heartworm test (negative), started on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, microchip and neutered. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in becoming Rex\u2019s family, you can start the adoption process by filling out an adoption application.

She is vetted except her spay which will happen in January  2021.\n\nJourney-I2045 comes to rescue as an owner surrender in TX. Her previous owner could not keep her confined.  Her DOB: 7.24.18 and her adoption fee is $250.00.  She is very sweet and was in her heat cycle when surrendered.  She came to MN a few weeks ago and our vet determined she was pregnant.  On 9.17.2020  Journey had the puppies.\n\nJourney carries her toys around even trying to sneak them outside. She loves people and needs a 6' fenced yard to make sure she is contained and stays safe. This is a requirement.\n\nShe has to live indoors with her humans.  She may not be tied, tethered, chained, kept outside or live with an electronic underground fence system.  She would run, so we will require a 6' fence to contain her.  She will also need obedience training.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.\nNOTE- TREVOR IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW. Trevor has been with the rescue now for almost 3 years. Why? We are not sure. He has been overlooked so many times and it really surprises us! Trevor came into the rescue, basically on death's door. He had pneumonia and the most severe case of heartworm we have ever experienced. Trevor has since been treated, saw a Cardiologist and is a happy, healthy boy! He does have some damage to his heart but that doesn't mean he won't live a long life. It just means he can't run a marathon with you!\n\nTrevor is around 6-7 years old and is the most polite boy. He walks wonderfully on a leash and loves to co-pilot in the car. Trevor's favorite pastimes are napping and cuddling. He LOVES treats and even tap dances in excitement waiting for a treat. He really is a sweet, amazing dog!\n\nTrevor will need to be the only dog in the home and we would prefer he be in a home with older children.\n\nNote from his foster: Trevor has been with me for over two years now. He has changed a lot from the dog that came to my house two years ago, but his fun loving personality has remained. He may not be the next star student in an obedience class, but he makes up for that with the unconditional love he gives and happy go lucky attitude. His life before he was rescued couldn't have been that great, considering the condition he was in at the time. But he has long forgotten the bad things that happened to him, and looks at each day as a new opportunity for fun, food and love. He always \"tap dances\" when food or treats are involved. He cuddles as close to you as he possibly can. He gives kisses freely. He's the best sleep partner, unless he ends up on the blanket and it's a chilly night.If you are interested in adopting Trevor, please contact:adarrahbullbullyrescue@gmail.com",

I'm an old soul with an extreme passion for laying on any couches, beds, and chairs I can fit into. I\u2019m really great at keeping them warm for you. I\u2019m a pretty easy-going laid-back dude. I do fine with dogs in moderation, those pups start driving me crazy after a while though. I haven't been raised with kids so probably an adult only home would be best for me. I am 100% housebroken and do NOT need to be crated. I know all my basic commands as well. I do enjoy walks; however, I\u2019m a bit lazy so I can take them or leave them. I am happiest with my person to check in with and then I go lay down. I love to lay in the sun, so I would love a fenced in yard to just lay in the sun for hours!! If interested in giving an old goat like me a home apply today!!!\n\n** As a member of the WGR Pitty Posse - all Pittys will be sent home with their very own Pitty Package!!\n\n***Please inquire ONLY online through our website at www.woofgangrescue.com***\n\nDATCP 402490",

Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.

            "description": "Sweet senior alert. Easy like a Sunday morning.\nIn May, Pearl was picked up by the city as a stray and taken to the local shelter. She became very sick with an upper respiratory infection and ear infections. She was rescued by Saving Hope and is doing so much better now! Pearl is 10 years old and 55 pounds. She loves to lay at the foot of her foster momma wherever she is. She's good on a leash and enjoys easy, leisure walks. Pearl rides very well in the car (especially when she getting custard!). She's potty trained and crate trained. She sleeps through the night. She's low energy and takes frequent naps. This senior would be the perfect companion to someone looking for a low maintenance dog. She would do best as an only pet, but has so much love to give. She is heartworm positive but has started treatment. Her adorable, silly moments will win your heart in no time. Just look at that tongue!\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

Deborah prefers an older mature family and is good with larger dogs after proper introductions.  She loves her \"people\" and loves to go on walks. She is 80 lbs, potty trained, walks well on a leash, is spayed, microchipped, and heartworm negative.

I am loving, loyal and obedient and I would be very protective of you I promise.  I need a fenced yard and I need someone who understands about my breed and will be a strong handler for me.  I also want to make sure that I have proper introductions to people and other pets.  I\u2019d really like to be your one and only but I live with another dog that I like at foster mamma\u2019s house and we get along.  I am 7 years old, 65 lbs., potty trained, microchipped and up to date on shots.  I love to go on hikes, bike rides, car rides but mostly I like to hang out with my people!  The cool folks at Rescue Dogs Dream got me out of the shelter at Pasco County because of medical issues that have been taken care of.

            "description": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m Slater, but my OCPBR family calls me Nugget. I was being given away when I was barely two weeks old, and just a wee nugget. (see what I did there?) Lucky for me, OCPBR scooped me up, and I was taken to my first foster home where I was bottle fed and nursed back to health. Once I got big and strong, I came to my current foster home where I have two extra large 4 legged foster siblings. Seeing as I didn\u2019t get to grow up with my litter mates, being able to learn and grow from my foster family has been super helpful and important. I\u2019m super energetic and need someone who\u2019s going to play with me, so a home with a senior dog would not be the best fit for me. I am a silly, fun puppy, but I do not like being hugged or restrained so a home with children under the age of 12 isn\u2019t a good fit for me. I completed puppy obedience training classes and I attend structured daycare 3 days a week where I am playing with new friends of all breeds and sizes and ages, I really like small dogs. I am crate trained and house trained, but sometimes have potty accidents in new environments like puppies do. I do have to eat a low protein diet, otherwise my body produces bladder stones. Don\u2019t worry OCPBR has already paid for all of the tests, so you will just need to feed me appropriate food and treats please. \n\nAt OCPBR, we do a foster to adopt with all of our puppies going to their new families. If you have another dog(s), the dog(s) must be completely friendly with puppies, other dogs and people. Please no senior dogs, puppies are young and energetic and need a playmate for their development. Plus it\u2019s unfair to senior dogs to have to endure normal puppy energy. They must also be current on vaccines. The foster must be willing and able to participate in our foster care program to include, ongoing obedience training and socialization.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Slater, please go to https://www.ocpbr.org/images/2019/08/OCPBR-Foster-to-Adopt-Application-2019.pdf and send in the app to adopt@ocpbr.org.",

I am crate trained and accustomed to wearing a pack on walks/hikes. I have a TON of energy, all day every day...total party girl. One of my favorite things is playing fetch with a tennis ball. I will go for hours if you let me. \n\nWhen I am really excited I will do Zoomies through your house. I have been to the lake a few times and enjoyed playing in the water! Although I am not a huge fan of baths (I tolerates them ?) I do great on car rides and happily jump right into the car. \n\nI have spent years going to doggy daycares and dog parks, unfortunately I have picked up some naughty habits and can be dog selective.\n\nIf interested in giving Lizzie a foster home or even better her true forever home, please email us at foster@ocpbr.org or adopt@ocpbr.org. \n\nWhen we say we back our OCPBR dogs for life we mean it ?? Lizzie was adopted from us back in 2014 as a younger girl, well now she is a little bit older and wiser and the perfect age of 6.5  - 7? Unfortunately our gorgeous girl needs a new forever home. We won\u2019t focus on why, rather welcome her back and thank her current adoptive family for keeping her with them until that home can be found. They love her very much, but sometimes things just don\u2019t work out. We don\u2019t have returns that often, in fact we are pretty sure this is our 2nd adoption return in Ten years of OCPBR.\n\nAge: almost 7 (in September) \nCurrent location: West Jordan, UT (will travel for foster family/forever home)\n\nForever home dreams do come true, but sometimes there are bumps along the way!",

I\u2019m about 4 years old and I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a pretty easy going guy. A couple months ago, OCPBR rescued me from a shelter, and they were told I\u2019m an abuse survivor. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means, but I do know I LOVE people. Cats aren\u2019t my favorite so my new home would be best without one, but I do like other dogs as long as they can be mellow and calm like me. Not to toot my own horn, but I walk perfectly on leash, even on pack walks with other dogs, and am already house and crate trained. All in all, I\u2019m a pretty easy going, chill, goof ball who loves to love. If you think we\u2019d be a good match, submit an application for me.\n\nI am also fully vetted, neutered, microchipped and looking for my perfect forever family. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Emmett, please go to https://www.ocpbr.org/adopt/adoption-application/ and email us at adopt@ocpbr.org",

Ranier's foster mom lovingly calls this mellow pup a \"space cadet\", which is one of her most endearing qualities. This sweet gal is initially a bit shy of new people, but quickly becomes sociable with humans and is nonreactive to other pups. Rainier is a perfect angel with kitties too, according to her foster mom, who reports that her cats sit on Ranier and groom her! She is an easy-going, trusting little soul who will follow you around the house. She just wants to be where YOU are, in case you are handing out pets or head scratches. She is so grateful for your attention! She gets a bit agitated when left alone, so she likely will be happiest in a home where somebody is at home most of the time. Treats and toys make transitions easier for her. Ranier has been fine socializing with children. \n\nRainier seems to have a hearing deficit but is learning to respond to signal training - isn't it wonderful that old dogs CAN learn new tricks? She walks well on leash, stopping here and there to read her \"pee-mail.\" Her energy level is fairly low, so short walks suit her just fine. \n\nRanier's goal in life is just to be at your side - she's ready for your home and YOUR LOVE. Her ideal home would be a quiet one, maybe even with another mellow doggy friend who could show her the ropes. Rainier is so deserving of all the care and attention you can give her! \n\nShe came to Peace of Mind from the Hollister Animal Shelter.",

            "description": "Smokie is a 65lb lean lab melon headed mix boy who is ready to take on the world by your side. He has the most beautiful coloring. In the light, you can see a gorgeous red brindle coat. Other times, he looks ebony and grey. Whatever he is, this boy is stunning and carries a regal presence. Just 3 years old, Smokie ensured more than his fair share of hardship and sorrow. He came to us as a cruelty case where a family member stabbed him in an effort to anger his owner. Smokie required extensive surgery to repair the stab wound and the hernia it caused. Abuse does not start there. However, Smokie feels nothing but love in his heart. \n\nDue to his traumatic past, Smokie entered a board and train program. By the time he completes his program, Smokie will complete his canine good citizenship test and be ready for a forever or foster home! Smokie is wonderful with other dogs, big and small. He loves to play tug of war, bounce around, and cuddle with them. In fact, Smokie loves any excuse to cuddle. Just tell him, \u2018The sun is setting real low, big guy\u2019 or sing \u2018Goodnight Sweetheart Goodnight\u2019 to him and Smokie will curl into you and start the snore train! \n\nSmokie is housebroken, crate trained, and is very comfortable in his crate. Also, this boy walks beautifully on a leash and heels like a pro! He knows all his commands and will love to show off his skills for you. \n\nSmokie loves his human and will do anything for them. For this reason, he needs someone that can help him understand that they do not need his protection- just love. The ideal home for this boy would be adult only and with someone who can provide him with boundaries. Smokie would be fine in an apartment, urban, suburban, or rural environment. He would love to be the only child or have a doggy sibling. We don't know how he is with cats. He just asks that you and him spend time together and keep his training up! This boy thrives on having a job or purpose!\n\nHis training comes with private lessons, if you are close enough. If not, we can arrange for ongoing lessons another way. \n\nIf interested in adopting or fostering Smokie, please email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. Please note we respond to all emails. If you do not hear back from us, please follow up! Sometimes, emails get lost in cyberspace. \n",

            "description": "Asher is in pretty rough shape but we are working with the vet clinic to get him all fixed up. He joined us this week from the Hazard, KY shelter. He is an older boy and has A LOT of medical going on, including a 3/5 heart murmur, needed dental, several lumps and bumps and some swelling and loss of range of motion in his right front leg. He is a little bit timid but very sweet and has a great personality and is very friendly :) Asher did very well with his dog test at the shelter. 9/5: Asher is heartworm negative and his chest x-rays look good despite the heart murmur. We are waiting on his bloodwork results and if they are good, we will get him scheduled for tumor removal and dental surgery. He did start on Enalapril for his heart and has been on antibiotics for the swollen spots on his legs. X-rays and testing did not show any signs of bone cancer, thank goodness. His leg is looking better and he is getting around better on it. He is incredibly sweet and is doing great with everyone. An owner did come forward for him but after a family discussion, they decided it was best for him to stay with the rescue so he can get all of the medical care that he needs. We know that was a difficult decision for them and we are thankful that they put his needs first and that they have entrusted us with his care. We also found out that his real name is Buster so that is what we are actually calling him :)9/10: Asher will be having an ultrasound tomorrow to check his heart for surgery and if all is good he will get his tumor and bumps removed and get some much needed dental work done early next week. Asher will be in need of a foster home and will likely be ready to travel as soon as the weekend of 9/26.10/2 UPDATE: Asher was cleared for surgery and came through it beautifully! He did great and the best news....his two tumors were benign!! His leg is all healed up and he is getting around perfectly. He still has a spot of skin healing on his chest but with medication and therapy it is looking much better.11/1: Asher who we are now calling by his real name Buster arrived at his Minnesota foster home last night after a super long day of transport from Kentucky. The spot on his chest cleared up enough that they were able to close it up. He is taking his meds like a champ and will get his suture stitches out soon. We are sure his foster fursister Susie will show him the ropes!!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- KYRIE IS LISTED AS A COURTESY TO ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW. Kyrie is a very playful and silly boy. Kyrie has been waiting for a home for long 4 years. His only hangup is he prefers to be an only pet in the home. This loving boy desperately deserves his own family. He is pretty low key, yet very entertaining. He loves all people, but would do best in a home with older children due to his size. Kyrie is neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting Kyrie, please contact: adarrahbullbullyrescue@gmail.comhttp://adarrahbullbullyrescue.webs.com/apply-to-adopt-foster",

            "description": "Tucker is a super handsome 3 year old love bug! He was adopted as a puppy but unfortunately as he aged, he did not do so well with the children in the home so he is now back with us at Eleventh Hour! Tucker needs an adult only home who understand when to give a dog his space. Tucker has given us nothing but love and affection at the kennel so he proved to us how sweet he can be. He isn't a huge fan of dogs but he DOES get along with CATS. Tucker lived with a female puppy (11 months old) but he did not like her too much. We believe he may be good with a calm, submissive female, or best as an only dog.\nHe is very skittish and would be a great fit for a quieter low-traffic household with adults who have dog experience.",

He is toy possessive in which his foster parents have been trying to work with him on the issue however he would benefit from actual training classes.   \n\nHe is smart and learns fast.  I would say he does need to be the only dog in the home and no cats.   And at some point would need slow introductions to other dogs.  \n\nHe is kennel trained as well.  He knows sit, he understands stay and come but does need some more training.   \n\nHe LOVES Car Rides and Walks.   He will actually walk to the door look up to his leash and ask for a walk.  He is harness trained as well.\n\nHe is a WORKING Breed dog and needs a fenced in yard.\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/22487/generic\n",

            "description": "Senior Hearts Rescue and Renewal is the only licensed senior dog rescue organization in Western Pennsylvania. We do not have a shelter or a public facility. ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog a loving furever home.\n\nA message from our Gigi... \n\nMy name is Gigi. I am a 13 year young, 21 pound cocker spaniel. I can\u2019t see and hear as well as I used to but that doesn't stop me from being a great dog.  \n\nI like to explore in the yard and smell everything. My nose works fantastically. Walks are good if they are short and you allow us to go at my leisurely pace. \n\nWhen I want attention I will come to you and put my head on your lap for pets and rubs.  I will snuggle when I want and I will let you know. I can still be an independent girl.\n\nI don\u2019t mind other dogs or cats as long as they aren\u2019t too wild and crazy. \n\nI can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nBuddy came to us after a rescue down in Kentucky brought him to our attention.\n\nThe KY rescue became aware of Buddy's situation through a network of animal rescuers in KY. They had gotten word of a very rural home that had an overflow of dogs that needed to be rescued. They had many dogs living outside in containment shelters, most of them sort of jerry rigged kennel type things.\n\nApparently (and some of these facts are speculation) apparently Buddy had lived in this jerry rigged outdoor kennel (and it wasn't a tiny kennel so at least he got to move around). For possibly 8 years. It was mentioned that maybe they got him as a young dog and now he is @ 9-11 years old.\n\nWhen you meet Buddy you will see how this situation would have been excruciating for him socially, as he is definitely a \"Devotion Dog\" He loves his person and wants to never be apart, really. He can be left of course if you go to work or aren't in the house with him, he does not have to be kenneled and will not destroy anything while you are gone and his 100% housetrained (so he doesn't have traditional separation anxiety) but you can tell when you get home and as you go about your day that this dog wants to be by your side.\n\nBuddy also I believe is a working dog. If he is 9-11 years old he doesn't act like it. He has a drive in him, a readiness, a wanting to go. He will and can relax and lay around for hours at an end but the point is when he has an opportunity to get outside, or to go for a walk, dog park, he is \"ALL IN\" like he LOVES to walk and loves to explore and loves to move. Maybe he is making up for lost time of being so limited for so long. But this dog wants to go and move and do things.\n\nAnd again he is as content as can be laying on dog bed near you while you work on the computer, etc. but when has chance, loves to be outside (cold and snow bother him not in the least) and he likes to just like be in the yard, and is like a guardian of the yard.\n\nWhere he is staying now the yard has chain link on one side that faces a big public park, if Buddy sees people walking by with their dogs (or just people) he will alert, with barking, he truly believes it is his duty to guard his yard. He also will sometimes bark at big vehicles like trucks going by, for some reason they stir him up.\n\nBuddy would do best in a home with a single person. After working with him I could see him being ok with 2 people but they would both have to be super confident and savvy in understanding guardian dogs and be able to manage Buddy if he started to prefer one person over the other.\n\nHe is brilliant with one person. No issues. We did see him have 2 experiences in 2 different homes where he preferred one person over the other (the one he bonded to with the most) and then start acting like \"the other\" was maybe something he needed to guard against or perceived suspiciously for some reason. It was slightly random at first so we did not see this coming at all in the beginning. But we have concluded that he should go to a solo home or if two people, super savvy dog people that could work with him if he started to prefer one over the other.\n\nIt is very sad in a way because when you know Buddy you could just picture that his ideal home would have been a big family with lots of kids, a huge yard (maybe a hobby farm), lots of people, love, activity and workin' it outside. That would have been Buddy's dream.\n\nBecause he was cooped up for at least 8 years and not worked with taught anything, this may have contributed to him preferring one person and not \"the other.\" We can only speculate.\n\nSo we are looking for \"the right\" home for Buddy and realize this won't be easy. But we want him to have a wonderful life full of love and activity and we do not want to set him up for failure.\n\nRight now the best home would be a single person who loves to be active and would get Buddy out there with him/her.\n\nBuddy 100% can be taken to the dog park-you just can't let him totally free if people are in the park \"just in case\" he perceived some to be a threat. He can go to the dog park with a 30 or 50 foot lead/harness and then you just gain control of him and steer him away from people if they are coming near, so you can give plenty of freedom and openness but just have ability to re-direct. I have included a video of an example of this. He basically ignores almost everyone at the dog park (not interested in the people whatsover) except will give an occasional bark if someone walking by somewhat close but doesn't lunge after them or try to go after them (Buddy is more defensive than offensive). But you just have to make sure you have control of him so you don't let people get to close to him (is the point).\n\nBuddy LOVES walks, you can walk him with a 30 foot lead. or a regular leash, giving him plenty of exercise and freedom, you just wouldn't stop and talk to someone with him, if someone on sidewalk you steer around them. Again Buddy is way more interested in what he is smelling, you just don't want him to get defensive (of you) if someone got to close.\n\nSo dog parks, walks- absolutely yes, You just have to be his responsible manager and you can give him the best active life possible.\n\nI could see Buddy totally living on a farm or hobby farm - IF the person had the ability to recall him when needed, teach him train him and/or had a fenced in area for him.\n\nBuddy is good with other dogs. Buddy is \"so so\" not so great with cats. With an old feeble cat he was fine, with a young cat he wanted to chase.\n\nUnfortunately no kids, even though he would adore children but because of his unpredictability can't take that chance.\n\nBuddy is a special dog. He has suffered at the hands of well intended humans and we are looking to make up for that by giving him the most loving, and active life he can enjoy..\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting, please fill out the form below:\n\nredemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms\n\nredemptionroadrescue@q.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\n\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention 2/2/21 2:19 PM",

            "description": "Rosie is a 8 year old Vizla X Doberman mix female who is one of the most intellegent dogs you will ever meet! Rosie is a pro at tricks!  She can sit, stay, lay down, lay on her side, spin, wait, backup, get a toy on command, run or go up or down stairs on command, can stand on her hind legs, ring a bell to go out, and even more!!!  Impress your friends and always have something fun to do on snow days with smart cookie Rosie.  She wants you to know that old dogs are NEVER too old to learn even more tricks.   Fully vetted, spayed and ready to find a new home!  Due to her owners poor and declining health, Rosie was surrendered to UDR. Rosie was loved her entire life with countless hours spent by her previous owners training her, cuddling her and sharing their lives together. But we all know life can be cruel and can throw curve balls, and sadly that is what has happened. Rosie will love and snuggle you and be your constant companion throughout life. She loves all humans big and small!!! Rosie could be a therapy dog for people!!! She is a very sweet and loving dog, who absolutely loves to cuddle. This girl has impeccable house manners! She really does ring a bell to go outside. Rosie is very smart as all Dobermans are and loves training and learning new tricks. She knows how to follow behind when walking,  how to untangle her leash, lay down, lay on her side, spin, wait, back up, wait outside a doorway, get a toy on command, go upstairs or downstairs or run on command, and she knows how to stand on her hind legs. She loves feeding toys and has learned to use a game board to find treats. Rosie is very obedient and has perfected the \"Stay\" command, she will wait all day, you can have her sit and then scatter treats all around her and make her wait to eat them until you tell her it's OK. She excels at most basic obedience, and is very treat motivated making her training easy, all though at times she will get distracted with things and critters outside. Rosie does have a very high prey drive, is a hunter and does not do well with other dogs or cats. She will need to be the queen of her castle. Rosie adores and loves people big and small!!  Rosie will need a fully fenced yard, no exceptions, due to her high prey drive for squirrels and rabbits. If you are looking for a low maintenance companion who will love you unconditionally, Rosie is your girl! Please apply if you qualify! www.uniteddobermanrescue.org",

How could we say no to that sweet face!?? \nJoy's pups have all found their forever homes, so now it is time for this momma to find hers!\nJoy had been such a \"\"joy\"\" to have at the shelter! She is absolutely precious.\nJoy is very sweet and has a meek and mild disposition. She is pretty shy but thoroughly enjoys playing with some of the younger pups at Save A Pet. She tends to mother the others. \nThought to be a Boxer mix, this girl weighs about 45 pounds. Multiple vets have aged her at 6 years old, but said she could be a little younger. She has had it a bit rough in the past so that can make dogs appear a little older sometimes. \nJoy never makes a mess in her kennel, so we believe that she has had some amount of house training or would be very easy to work with on house training. \nIf you are interested in learning more about Joy, please call the Save A Pet shelter at 478-994-3882.",

Gracie is much more shy than Joya but has warmed up a little bit and is starting to learn to trust her foster mom but she will let you know when she does not like something. Even though she used to walk well on a leash she recently has been resistant to going on walks outside so will need a home with a yard so she is able to go in and out to potty. She is completely housebroken (ie will hold it until she can be let out) and only barks a little. Once she trusts you she'll she likes curling up at your feet and hanging on your every word with her cute goofy smile. She is not a fan of grooming or vet visits. She is around 8 years, 19 lbs and very healthy. She MUST be adopted with Joya-https://post.rescueme.org/20-08-22-00293",

I haven\u2019t been introduced to any kitties. I\u2019m pretty quiet as I don\u2019t bark.

While in rescue it was discovered that he has some heart issues so will likely need to be on meds for life. His meds will be about $45 per month but he is worth every penny and will repay it in kisses and snuggles. He also had a dental while in rescue. Joya is 20 lbs and around 10 years old.

Please visit BetterDaysRescue.org and to read policies and Deana's requirements/details.\n\n**\nDeana will be placed in the Phoenix metro area, for proximity to our rescue (home checks, follow up visits, visit to finalize adoption) and for access to our veterinarian. Sorry, no exceptions.\n\n**\n\nAdoption begins with a Foster-To-Adopt arrangement that continues until Basic and Intermediate Obedience Training are completed. When training is complete, adoption can be finalized.\n\n**\n\nDeana is just adorable, full of playful energy and enthusiasm! Daily hikers, walkers, runners take note! Her coloring is exquisite and she is an athlete! Deana is elated to meet new people and wants to be friends with everyone. She bounces on to each new attraction/interaction with eager anticipation.\n\nDeana's breed mix suggests she may have a strong prey drive, so she will not be placed with a small dog. Since she is dog-selective, she will require training before successfully integrated with another dog.\n\nWe encourage you to register on our site and \"Favorite\" the dog(s) that interest you, so that you will be notified when bio, photos, or status are updated.\n\n\"Companion animal\" means, needs at least one other friendly, playful dog that lives full-time in the same household.\n\"Fenced yard\" means, a backyard that is adjacent to and connected with your residence. (It does not mean a nearby fenced area/dog park.)\nGates must have padlocks and thresholds (cement or buried pavers to prevent digging.)\nYard and patio must be free of debris and have room for dogs to run and play *on a lawn and/or in a very shaded area.* Please do not invite us to your home if you have not yet landscaped your yard!\n\"Swimming pool\" means a private, in-ground, year-round pool that is available to the dog daily or multiple times per week.\nWe do not place dogs in situations where there are \"drained\" or empty swimming pools, which are a fall hazard and contribute to the propogation of mosquitos.\nLast and not least, we DO NOT adopt to students as we have found that they often do not know or anticipate where life will take them.\n\nDiscussion about a dog - including scheduling of a home check or other dialogue - cannot occur until we have received your completed adoption application. NO EXCEPTIONS. Thank you!",

The dog got some food and water from others in the neighborhood, but learned to fend for himself.  He was leery of having people approach him, so a trap was set and thankfully he went right in.  He seemed almost grateful to be back with people and it took him no time at all to allow his sweet nature to come through.  He was eaten up with fleas and his skin and coat were in horrible condition, but he is mostly healed now and ready to find his true forever home.  We will look for a fenced yard so he does not feel like he has been turned out again and always knows that he is home.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

My exuberant joy for life is beyond measure! I love everyone and have a playful nature. I may be semi-paralyzed but that doesn't stop me from loving you and being the sweetest, funniest companion. I have partial use of one of my back legs but can sometimes get tired because I'm a big boy. I am incontinent but have learned to use diapers, and with a feeding schedule I will be even better. I don't need a wheelchair or surgery. Being my owner will have its challenges, but together, we can get through anything! I know I already love you, will you love me back? Contact Mayday today to meet me so we can start our forever together!\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

He expelled an impressive amount of gas and immediately felt better. He is now in great health and is very happy! Thumper is around 4 years old and is playful. he gets along with other dogs. He has not been around kids, but he is very friendly with people. Thumper is housebroken and crate-trained. He is affectionate and loves sitting in laps. He is in great health and is ready for a family of his own! Fill out an adoption application to meet him! Learn more about me and fill out an online adoption application on the From the Heart Rescue website at: www.fthar.org.\n\nMy requested adoption donation includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations and medical care to date, microchip implantation and registration, collar, leash, ID tag, health check-up and one month of free pet health insurance (some restrictions may apply).\n\nIf Im not exactly what you want, please visit my other friends in rescue at From The Heart Rescue on our website at www.fthar.org.",

My friends (the staff here at the shelter) continue to work with me daily to build up my trust and confidence in people. When I'm in my kennel I can be shy and fearful, but when I go to the play yard with my trusted friends, I have a great time! \n\nI would prefer to be the King of my castle (the only pet in the household) for now, and I would do best in a low traffic home where I can be engaged in training and activities that keep my mind and body active. If you stop by to see me at the shelter, it might take a few visits to get to really know me, so don't hesitate to visit me often! Thanks, Morty Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: Black Weight: 80lbs Age: 3yrs 4mths 4wks Animal has been Neutered",

He's a big ole teddy bear who needs the right kind of love and attention from his forever home.\nLaney loves treats and a good ear scratch from time to time along with walks, since he is a jumper, putting him outside in your backyard, you would have to constantly supervise him until he gets to know you and you all build that trust.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available.

She requires a husky-experienced home and will not be adopted to a family without husky experience. \n\nShe does well with all people, including children. \n\nLuna Buna does well with other dogs her size or larger. She is NOT good with small dogs, cats or other small pets. As tends to be with the husky breed, she has a high prey drive and therefore will not be placed in any home with small animals. A husky savvy and experienced family is preferred. Luna Buna is 6 years old, about 50 pounds, spayed, micro-chipped and current on required vaccines. This pretty girl is house trained and a doll to have around a family.  \n\nShe walks nicely on a leash, knows sit, shake and other commands. She\u2019s civilized and yet has a wonderful sense of humor and silly side. \n\nHer previous family was impacted very severely by the Covid crisis and could no longer care for Luna from a financial perspective and so they did the best thing for her by getting her into rescue so we could help her find the best forever family for her.\n\nHope that family is you! If you are interesting in meeting this beautiful, petite girl please complete an adoption application at www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html",

            "description": "Like all great celebrity couples, Bonnie & Clyde, Johnny & June, Oprah & Stedman - this adorable bonded pair has a little bit of everything. Tulip & Prince can be mischievous, entertaining and sweet all in the same day! We promise you\u2019ll never be bored with these two around. Tulip is a senior female with a gorgeous Pyrenees coat. Prince is a younger adult Pyr mix with beautiful golden markings. These two keep each other entertained but also enjoy lots of attention from their humans. We don\u2019t think Tulip and Prince had much training or socialization before coming to NGPR but they have made such great progress since being in their foster home. They are getting used to new people and showing less nervous behavior, also doing well with other dogs, providing there are slow introductions. They have learned their house manners at their foster home and can now sit patiently while waiting for food and treats. Now that they feel more secure at their foster home there is no more counter surfing and both are housebroken. They love lounging together in their yard, chasing squirrels, munching on hot dog slices and chewing on bones. Going on leash walks is something they love, too. They have become so much better with baths, grooming and nail trims. At the end of a long day, their favorite thing to do is snuggle up with their humans, which includes letting them squish their faces and flop all over them :) We know the Pyrfect home is out there for this dynamic duo and they promise to keep you entertained all day long!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I keep my muscular body in shape, with my love to run. HSO staff quickly noticed that I am very smart. Did I mention I love to run? As I am an active a guy, I would love to have big space to run and play. I do need a cat-free home. I do require a monthly heartworm preventative to keep me in my best health. I am a big lover of people, petting and treats. So, come by HSO and ask for Charlie Bear!\n****************\nAll animals at HSO are current on their vaccinations and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. If not already spayed/neutered, there may be a short delay between when you select this pet and when they are ready to go home.\n\nBreed and age are determined based on observable physical traits. Actual lineage and birth date are rarely know.\n\nAdoption Fees:\nCats $50\nDogs 6 years and over $50\nDogs 6 months to 5 years $75\nPuppies under 6 months $100\n\nCome visit our pets Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-2pm.",

            "description": "Can you even believe that Ziggy has been with PAW for 1095 days! No dog should have to wait for a furever home for 3 years. Will you help him find a family to love him?\n\nZiggy is an active 4-year-old pup who weighs about 45 lbs. He has lots of energy and would benefit from a family who enjoys outdoor activities. Currently Ziggy lives with two other dogs, one bigger and one smaller. He does NOT need to be an only dog, he just needs the right match. Ziggy can be reactive when walking on leash and will need a patient human to help him navigate walks around the neighborhood. \n\nIn an ideal world, Ziggy would live in a home with a large backyard and tall privacy fence so he could run to his heart's content, however that is not a deal-breaker as long as he gets plenty of exercise. Apartment/city living is probably not for Ziggy. Although an adult-only home is preferred for Ziggy, older, respectful teens may be okay. The BIGGEST thing he needs is TIME & PATIENCE to feel comfortable and confident in his new home. Doesnt he deserve that???\n\nZiggy doesnt always put his best paw forward when he meets new people but he bonds hard and will become a loyal best friend. He is smart, house-trained, and adorably cute. His foster mom is his biggest advocate and just wants him to find his happily ever after!!! Will that be with you?\n\n \n\nTo submit an adoption application go to: https://www.petstablished.com/pets/public/256884",

            "description": "Angel is a Labrador Retriever/Hound mix, born February 2019. She came to Muddy Paws with two of her puppies, Finley Rose and Huckleberry. Due to her being fearful, we recommend that there be no young children in her new home. SHE ALSO PREFERS WOMEN and it may take men a couple visits to gain her trust. Angel knows some basic commands and is mostly house-trained. She loves to play with toys and balls. She can be VERY fearful of strangers until she gets to know them, so you may need a couple visits with her to gain her trust.\n\nAngel has had a very hard life involving possible abuse and neglect and would love a fresh start in a quieter home with patient adopters willing to help her become the best version of herself. Adopter will need to be open to working with one of our trainers free of charge.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Angel is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

I do have a little arthritis in my hips and take medicine for that. I do best on carpets, not slick surfaces. A ranch style home would be best, however I am fine with a couple of stairs. I ride well in the car and love everyone!   Our rescue require a fenced yard and no children under 6 years.    I do take Proin each day",

He loves to run and play with other dogs, or just by himself, and is pretty good at fetch. He loves to cuddle and will climb right up into your lap. He does well with kids but forgets how big he is sometimes. He is very vocal and isn't a fan of people leaving, but he calms down pretty quickly. He does well in the car, he's house trained, he knows how to sit, but isn't a fan of cats. Would do best in a house with older kids and I am good with dogs that are simular in size.Prior to adoption I will be altered, vaccinated, health checked, dewormed, and micro-chipped.\nAdoption Fee $250 +taxes/feesIf you would like to meet me please fill out a pre-adoption application at www.tailsrescue.orgHappy Tails Adoption Center is open on Sundays from 12-5pm. We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me? Click here to fill out an application!Happy Tails Rescue Minnesota is located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley MN 55432. We are open for adoption events from 12-5 every Sunday. If there is a certain animal you want to meet at one the events please fill out a preadoption application to directly contact their foster family or check our Facebook page to see if they will be there! Their event attendance is based on the availability of their foster family.\nHome visits (video tours or in person) are required for all dog adoptions. All of our cats and dogs are INDOOR pets and are NOT to be left outside unattended (even in a fenced yard), or running loose!",

Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull mix\nSex: Neutered Male\nDOB: ~05/03/2015\nWeight: 56 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Playful, Loyal, Sensitive, Cautious, Snuggly!\nHistory: Owner surrender\nFence Requirements: Preferred\nIdeal Home: Only pet, no small children. Teenagers ok.\nSpecial Info: Familiar with living in a home, housebroken, obedience trained, loves to go for walks, play fetch, and snuggle under blankets. Comes with a care package of all of his favorite things as well as one free training session with our trainer!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

We were asked to help find him a new home and we couldn\u2019t say no to this boy. We strongly feel that Duncan had a very rough time with his first family and his very formative years were spent without the proper amount of exercise, socialization, and training.\n\nDuncan shows a strong bond to those he trusts and we feel he deserves to find a family who will show him what true love means. Since coming to us Duncan has been working very hard to get his exercise and to learn to be a good boy. He has come so far with the help of Boston Dogtor.\n\nDue to Duncan's needs, we want to make sure that he finds the perfect family and it's a great match from day one. Boston Dogtor has graciously agreed to meet with Duncan's adopters to teach them the proper handling technique and show them the skills Duncan has learned. \n\nWe do think Duncan would do well in a home with a confident female dog. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Duncan, please visit our website to fill out an application! \nwww.safewithusanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull mix\nSex: Spayed Female\nDOB: ~05/28/2017\nWeight: 50 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium-High\nPersonality Type: Confident, Goofy, Life of the Party!\nHistory: Stray\nIdeal Home: Fenced in yard (no invisible fences), no other pets or children, no apartments! Dog experienced home!!!\nSpecial Info: Loves to go for walks and does well on a leash! Enjoys car rides! One free session with our trainer is included in her adoption fee.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Remo is a 2 year old pittie mix.  This big sexy beast had a rather rocky start in life.  His foster mom has literally luved him back to life. He is still a bit skittish & protective over his food so his perfect family will be one who understands rescue dogs and has patience to help Remo continue to learn how to be a playful pup.  He loves cuddles and playing with the cats. He is leash and kennel trained    He sleeps mostly in the bed with his foster family so he\u2019s a great snuggle partner.  Remo just needs his furever family to find him soon so he can start growing as a part of the family.   Like most rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

He will be a wonderful dog for an experienced Rottie owner who will take charge. Norman will do best in a home with no young children or cats. \n",

            "description": "\u201cOhana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten.\u201d\n\nMaggie is a 5 year old, sweet and loving tripod who weighs around 55 pounds. From becoming a tripod as a puppy, rupturing her cruciate ligament, and a long journey to recover from that, Maggie has had quite the rollercoaster of a life. She is ready to put these events behind her, and join a furever family that will love her as much as she loves them. We cannot believe that this sweet girl hasn\u2019t gotten snatched up yet because she is about as sweet as they come!\n\nMaggie is completely crate-trained and housebroken, but she can be trusted to have free rein in the house. If left out in the house while you\u2019re away, Maggie will just snooze the day away on the couch until her person comes home. Maggie knows \u201csit,\u201d \u201cstay,\u201d and \u201cdown.\u201d She\u2019s working on learning \u201cfocus\u201d to redirect her attention to her Foster Mom when she gets distracted.\n\nMaggie has such an optimistic view of the world and absolutely adores every person that comes her way. Some might expect her to be a wary or nervous dog, but she\u2019s completely trusting of people. She sees strangers as the best friends she hasn\u2019t met yet, and she\u2019s ready to share her love of life with everyone. Foster Mom says she has a personality so sweet that it\u2019s infectious to everyone she meets. She is the type of dog who will love you unconditionally: she gets whole-body wiggles every time that her person walks through the door. \n\nMaggie needs a home where she is the only resident animal - she\u2019s got enough love for everybody! She\u2019s not a big fan of cats, but we are happy to share that Maggie is getting good with her dog etiquette! She\u2019s attended doggy charm school and has worked with a trainer to help her relate to other dogs. Even though she is a typical talkative pitty, she\u2019s learning how to appropriately engage in play and has enjoyed many playdates with other friendly ACR dogs! She loves to run back and forth with dogs along the fence and is enjoying what it means to have canine pals!\n\nCurrently Maggie is happy with a couple good walks a day, but she loves to get to run around! She is a HUGE fan of getting to run in large spaces, and she lights up when she sees a big fenced-in area where she can really see how fast those three legs can take her -- and that\u2019s pretty fast! Ms. Maggie loves to play tug-of-war with anyone up for the challenge, but she can also entertain herself with some of her favorite toys: Kongs with treats and peanut butter stuffed inside are some of her favorites! \n\nMaggie has a huge personality with brains to boot, and she knows how to communicate what she needs with her people.  If she catches you looking at her, she\u2019ll probably wiggle over to you to ask for some butt scratches and belly rubs! If she could have her way, she\u2019d cuddle up close to someone all day long. When she gets super cozy, she spreads out to take up as much room on the couch as she can, and her foster mom just doesn\u2019t have the heart to move her when she\u2019s so peaceful! When she is, you\u2019ll know as soon as she\u2019s drifted off to sleep because our girl is not the most delicate snoozer: she\u2019s got quite the powerful snore!\n\nMaggie has been waiting so long because she knows the perfect family is out there for her and is waiting with open arms. Could it be yours? Contact us today, she can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be considered to adopt, the first step in the process is to submit an application through our website: http://athenscaninerescue.com/adoption-procedures/. Our adoption fee is $250 per dog over the age of 6 months and $300 per dog 6 months or younger. We accept payment by Venmo, PayPal, or card.\n\nThis includes: basic vet care (i.e. basic vaccinations, including boosters completed after adoption, spay/neuter, heartworm/flea preventatives, and treatment for any health needs while in our care), a microchip, a week\u2019s worth of food for the trial-period, and a harness lead.\n\nWe typically adopt to homes within 30 minutes of Athens, GA, as we require a basic home check to ensure all dogs are placed in a safe environment. If you are further away than that and are interested in one of our pups, please still fill out an application and we can discuss your options. \n\nWe do not have a facility and operate through a network of foster homes. Thus, we do not have a phone number. If you\u2019d like to discuss potential adoptions, please email at adopt@athenscaninerescue.com.",

See our adoption proccess.\n*** Adoption Pending***\n\nSILVER is from a really sad situation where she was left on their own for at least two years at a construction site. Food and water were not always available, and she sought shelter and shade under a variety of construction vehicles. Silver came into rescue and was given a thorough vet exam and much needed bath and grooming! While the volunteers were at first timid about interacting with these \"wild\" pups, Silver soon won them over! She is gentle, loves attention and easy to walk on leash. Very chill and laid back this pup deserves a place to call home where she can be spoiled, and she can get all the love she has missed out on. She can be uncertain and protective around other dogs so would love to be in a home without other pups and definitely no cats. She loves kids and seems to actually prefer kids to adults according to our volunteers who brought their children out for dog socialization. This pup is quite food driven but needs to lose a few pounds so a healthy diet will help her out immensely.\n\nLooking for that chill, loving older Mal? Silver could be your girl!!\nInterested in sponsoring? See our sponsorship information.",

This handsome boy is super smart, affectionate, loves to play with other dogs, and makes a great running partner. At his foster home, he's been a wiz at training and learning commands like sit, wait (stay), down. He's excited to learn and eager to please. Brooks will bond with you and the people in your home. He can be protective of his treats and toys, but he has been working with a trainer on resource guarding. He will need a patient and committed owner who continue with training and building his confidence.Brooks would do best in a home with children no younger than teenagers. He's crate trained, house trained, and good with cats. He'd love to have another dog brother or sister to play with!\nBrooks has been neutered and microchipped, and is up to date on vaccines. Brooks' adoption fee is $400.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!If you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org.

He was dumped out of a vehicle off a very busy freeway, and thankfully a good samaritan saw him dropped off and rescued him before getting killed on the road. \nMango is a wonderful boy who loves people & children, does well with most dogs his size, and is learning to ignore the cats when on a leash. Although he is a Malinois, he has a calmness about him. He prefers to be in the house with his people and when they leave. If left outside alone, he will jump the fence. Mango is house trained and is good indoors. He loves his crate when left at home. We are looking for someone with a large dog experience because he is still a Malinois. He is a fantastic rodent hunter & athlete! \n\nPlease help us find Mango a family of his own.\n\nAdoption donation fee and home inspection required. \nApplication for adopting and fostering -   https://form.jotform.com/201328449376157\n\nThank you, \nDharma DOG Movement\nAwareness | Advocacy | Saving Lives\n\nIf you have any questions about fostering or adopting, please contact Dharma Dog Movement directly at adopt@dharmadogmovement.org\n\n08/2020\n\n\n",

Mork loves playing with other dogs and toys but is also an amazing snuggler. He is a tad shy around strangers at first but the moment he warms up, he will show you how amazing he really is. Mork wants a person/family who will provide him with a life of mental and physical stimulation while keeping him safe and happy. He loves to be with his people, so he needs a plan if there are longer workdays, so he is not spending too much time in a crate.\n\nMork came to us after being rescued from the shelter system.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you. You can find our application at Lovejoyfoundation.orgYou MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application. We are a Southern California based rescue and do nothing adopt further than an hour from our headquarters in Inglewood, Ca. we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nABOUT VENUS:\n\nVenus arrived at SNARR's adoption center with a freshly amputated hind leg and a very guarded demeanor. However, once she got the hang of walking on 3 legs and had some time to decompress, her awesome personality shined through! \n\nDespite being a tripod, Venus is still very strong and will require an experienced dog owner who will be able to handle her strength! She will likely need quiet time to decompress in a new home once adopted, so we do recommend she goes to a more low-key household without small children.\n*Venus is not comfortable around men and will require a female adopter.*\n\nVenus is up to date on vaccinations and has been spayed and microchipped.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Venus, please go to www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and fill out an application.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Brewer is a handsome and loyal Greater Swiss Mountain dog mix who loves his toys and dotes on his humans. He gets very tuned in to his people, has good house manners and is highly food motivated. Quick to learn, he already knows a few commands (sit, paw, down). \nSmaller than a standard Swissie, Brewer is fully grown at about 85 lbs. He is an adult (The NY vet estimates him at 5-6), and has a medium energy level. Regular exercise is excellent for him, but mountain hikes or dog park play would not be ideal as he has arthritis in his hips (which is managed with medication). Brewer has doggie friends, but can sometimes be intimidated by larger male dogs (Brewer isn\u2019t a cat person). Although he loves his toys and treats, he isn\u2019t always good at sharing, so would thrive in an adult home or a home with older children. \nThis handsome guy does not ask for a lot. He would love a life where he can be with his people most of the time, play with his toys, sleep on a soft doggy bed and go for happy regular walks. \n\nBrewer is up to date on vaccinations and has been dewormed, neutered and microchipped.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Brewer, please go to www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and fill out an application.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

I love to go for car rides and jogs; if I'm not hopping in the car you can find me chillin' poolside or playing with my foster sister. Snacks are my best friend, I could eat them aallll day! Especially if they involve cuddling and watching a movie. Not only am I polite and patient for outside potty breaks, but I am also crate trained. My foster mom says that her most favorite thing about me is that I'm not a drooly dog! Have you heard of heartworms? I am currently recovering from heartworm tratment that I recieved Mid January! If you'd like to know more about me, please email: Prairiepawsfoster@gptx.org with the subject: A184327",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nMEET NAVYA: the great adventurer, the wheelchair queen, and the star of her neighborhood back in India. \n\nNavya was rescued in India after being found on the highway, dragging herself with cars zipping by her a hundred miles an hour. A kind gentleman got her out of harm's way, but not before her poor feet were crushed by a car. Once rescued, she was flown into Chicago, and then transported from Chicago to Texas. Now she is waiting to make her New York debut where she hopes to find her forever home!\n\nNavya is such a trooper and has really come a long way! She uses her wheelchair like a champ, and has even gone to the beach in her wheels! And guess what? She LOVED IT!\n\nThere seems to be some potential for her to use her back legs again someday; you can see her try to use them at times while in her cart. SNARR is able to provide amazing physical therapy for her in NY (our PT foster is in Armonk) if we can find a foster or adopter for this sweet girl.\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt Navya, go to www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and fill out an application.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Hi meet Chance,\n\nChance is a Lovely American Bulldog mix who is about 6 years old and is full grown at around 70lbs. Chance loves playing with his humans and toys but is also an amazing snuggler. He is a tad shy around strangers at first but the moment he warms up, he will show you how amazing he really is. He would be best as an only dog in the home as he LOVES to get all the attention. Chance wants a person/family who will provide him with a life of mental and physical stimulation while keeping him safe and happy. He loves to be with his people, so he needs a plan if there are longer workdays, so he is not spending too much time in a crate. He would make a wonderful hiking, running, or walking partner.\n\nChance came to us after being rescued from the shelter system. The independent fellow rescuer that pulled him and Allie wanted to give them a second opportunity to find their forever homes, but they fell ill and needed help, they reached out to TLF for assistance.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you. You can find our application at Lovejoyfoundation.orgYou MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application. We are a Southern California based rescue and do nothing adopt further than an hour from our headquarters in Inglewood, Ca. we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

            "description": "Hi meet Allie,\n\nAllie is a Lovely American Bulldog/ Hound mix who is about 4 years old and is full grown at around 70lbs. Allie loves playing with her people and toys but is also an amazing snuggler. She is a happy go lucky girl with all who meets her. She would be best as an only dog in the home as she loves the attention and is not a fan of sharing. Allie wants a person/family who will provide her with a life of mental and physical stimulation while keeping her safe and happy. She loves to be with her people, so she needs a plan if there are longer workdays, so she is not spending too much time in a crate. Allie would make a great hiking, running, and walking partner.\n\nAllie came to us after being rescued from the shelter system. The independent fellow rescuer that pulled her and Chance wanted to give them a second opportunity to find their forever homes, but they fell ill and needed help, they reached out to TLF for assistance.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you. You can find our application at Lovejoyfoundation.orgYou MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application. We are a Southern California based rescue and do nothing adopt further than an hour from our headquarters in Inglewood, Ca. we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

As with almost all our pets, we seldom have a full understanding of their background. We suspect Vincent had a bit of a rough start. For that reason, he will do best in a quieter home with no other pets where he can be the STAR! Vincent is a big boy, so we do not recommend him for a home with smaller children. Vincent is still young and will want to get out every day for exercise. Long walks or hikes will be just fine with him. Once back at home he will want to rest and flop over for belly rubs. Vincent is just a big baby! To ask about Vincent or to make an appointment call the shelter at 513-735-2299.",

She can be with other dogs as the pictures depict, but in close quarters or in her environment, she will fight with other dogs (mainly females). So it is best that she go to a home where she is the only pet.\nStella came to us a year ago as a stray - was in a foster home for months - adopted and now back with us in foster care. Stella is a loving dog with humans and loves a good snuggle! She would need a lot of exercise as well. She is young and has a lot of energy.\n\n\nADOPTION FEE:  A Donation",

            "description": "Puppernickel is a 14 week old Great Pyrenees puppy that was unfortunately mauled by another dog at her property when she was only 3 weeks old. After a few weeks she was thankfully surrendered to a vet clinic and they reached out to us to help get her the proper care Puppernickel has seen a neurologist and while there is evidence of cervical spine trauma and remodeling, she also suffers from deformities of her thoracic spine and there is sadly no surgical intervention that will help her be able to walk again without a wheelchair. She is a very sweet girl who is good with everyone and everything that she meets. She tries her best to do all the things she wants to do and now she has her wheels she is enjoying being mobile once again!\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nBDHPI Puppy Policy\n\nAll puppies less than 6 months of age are too young to be spayed/neutered so they are adopted out on special puppy spay/neuter agreements with a $50 refundable spay/neuter deposit. Adopting families must agree to get the puppy altered within 2 weeks of 6 months of age and send proof of S/N to BDHPI accordingly. Adopting families are expected to make a donation of $425 minimum for mixed puppies AND will have the additional costs listed above, so please keep this in mind.\n\nWhen adopting a puppy, new families need to be prepared for not only a substantial financial investment, but also a significant time commitment in order to raise your puppy properly. Crate training is a critical part of setting them up for success as well as potty training. You can't leave a puppy in the crate for longer than 4 hours max and they typically have to be let outside every hour when you are home since their bladder is not as big as an adult. You will want to make sure your puppy gets regular exercise and has plenty of mentally stimulating chew toys such as puzzle toys(food cubes, busy buddy toys, kongs, etc). Socialization the first 6 months is critical to their development socially and once they have had all of their shots, you will want to take your new puppy everywhere you can to get them used to meeting lots of new people, different dogs, and visiting places outside of the home. Obedience training is also extremely important (and actually part of our adoption agreement requirements) so that your puppy grows up to be a gentle giant instead of a giant monster!\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Blane lived indoors  and would prefer a family that wont leave him alone for long periods of time.  Blane should be the only dog in the home and due to his rough housing when he starts to play and get excited young children are a not good idea for this guy.

While one of the volunteers was speaking with a police officer about another matter, she had mentioned that she had been keeping an eye on a doggie that had been chained to a dog house and bred over and over and over again.  Before the officer could help it, the doggie had disappeared.  She had looked everywhere for it, to no avail.\n\nThe lady at Lucies compared photos of me and the dog the officer was talking about, and they believed me to be the same dog!  You see, I was believed to have been chained and bred over and over and over.  I had arrived at Lucies shortly before they had this conversation.  Amazing right?\n\nIt's so nice to know that there are police officers out there that care as much about us pets as they do humans.  To protect and serve...she did that alright!!\n\nThe nice peeps here took me in and cared, loved and trained me.  I'm now a happy, well cared for doggie :)  I could possibly be a great watchdog, as I am very alert.\n\nI so enjoy playing in the water and fetching balls!\n\nWhat I would really enjoy though, is having a family that would give me the love and attention I deserve after all I have been through.  Could you be that family???\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

Maximus will not be an easy dog. He is a very loving dog but his love nips hurt and he really needs someone who is patient and will take the time he needs to help him understand the world.

Copper is wonderful and won't disappoint. This handsome boy came to us as an owner surrender after the other dog in the home didn't accept him. It wasn't his fault!\n\nCopper can be aloof at first-- he is still a 'puppy brain' and trying to figure where he belongs in the world. Especially in new settings, there are so many great things to smell that he might get busy exploring his environment. He does pull hard on a leash. But once he settles in, he is just the sweetest baby who wants to cuddle, play, snuggle on the couch, and be your best friend.\n\nHe loves other dogs and dog parks even more. He has a a lot of energy and some older dogs might not appreciate his exuberance. We also don't recommend young kids because he may jump on them-- he needs to learn manners. He is potty trained and loves playing in the yard-- a fenced yard would be the best for him.\n\nCopper does not, however, enjoy car rides. He becomes very scared and just howls-- \"what is this insane contraption?\" he says and \"why is the ground moving?\"\n\nThis sweetie is just waiting for someone to give him a chance.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 8/1/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Rocky was surrendered by his owners to a rural shelter. Carolina Poodle Rescue pulled him from the shelter.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Rocky had surgery on 8/14/20 to remove a retained testicle that was cancerous. He also had a dental and lost 4 teeth. Rocky is a bit underweight. He also has hair loss and itchy skin from suspected flea allergies.\nWeight: 19 lbs. Rocky should weigh at least 25 lbs.\nHeight: 14 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 - I am priceless\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Rocky is a little like a sour-patch kid - he is equal parts sweet and sour. He needs an experienced owner that is comfortable allowing Rocky to live on his terms. He is not a dog that you can pick up - he will snap at you. Rocky needs a quiet, low-traffic home where he can retire. He would prefer to be the only dog, but could live with other animals. Rocky will not be placed in a home with children; he will snap at them.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Rocky is a senior guy who likes what he likes and doesn't like what he doesn't like. All things are on his terms. He is a quiet boy who prefers to spend most of his days relaxing in his crate on a soft bed with the door open. This allows him the freedom to come and go as he prefers, on his terms. Rocky loves food and he will work for food when he is in the mood. You just have to remember that he can go from very loving to spicy in a matter of seconds. When Rocky is not in the mood or doesn't want to do something, he will try to bite.\n\nRocky is an independent soul. He doesn't mind other dogs, but really prefers being alone. He is indifferent to cats, primarily ignoring their presence. He walks well on a leash and will follow your voice. His favorite things are fuzzy beds and quiet space.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Aloof and quiet\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Rocky's estimated birthday is 7/31/2007\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I did not check the 'special needs' box because she has no special needs. Yes, she only has 3 legs but that is not a special need or a disability. She gets around just fine. She does not climb the stairs but she can jump off of the deck and climb her way back up. She is maintenance free, she requires nothing extra other than love and head scratches.\nLady Faith was found on the side of the road after being hit by a car. The break was so bad she needed to have her back left leg amputated. She is up to date on vaccinations, rabies, already spayed, heartworm negative and microchipped.\nThis young lady (vet estimates her to be 8 years old) is kind and gentle, she loves dogs of all sizes. She is already completely house trained and can be totally trusted to be left alone in the home while you are gone. She is also crate trained. She will go to the door when she has to potty but if you do not see her she will come and get you. She has perfect house manners.\nIf you want a very loving companion, Lady Faith is your lady! She has manners, she loves treats and she loves to be loved. No barking, sometimes she will talk to you if you talk to her! Her personality is what you are looking for if you want a cozy companion. She weighs 62 lbs and does not shed. She walks well on a leash, enjoys a car ride and just hanging out with you no matter what it is.\nTransportation is available across the United States.\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spay/neutered (fixed), rabies shots appropriate for their age, and dewormed twice. The dogs are up to date on vaccinations according to their age at the time of adoption. They are microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative. ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and/or phone calls. We will reply to you. Thank you.",

I\u2019m a sweet , energetic girl with lots of love to give! I get along well with other dogs and I LOVE people! I also get along with cats! \n\nI am a bit chunky, I currently weigh 66 lbs., but could stand to weigh about 57. I\u2019m working on it! I am a Pit Bull mix and I have a beautiful black-brindle coat! I\u2019m shorter than you might think, kinda stalky. I would love a fun, active family to call my own; one with a fenced yard for me to run and play! \n\nThe fee to adopt Erica is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Erica, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Erica is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Erica, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Erica.",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting Tony, please email jimmy.he@lostdogrescue.org.\n\nTony is a dog on a mission. A mission to find his one and only human that is! Tony still has all the boundless energy and curiosity of a young puppy, but the list of ways to appreciate him is simple ... Throw ball. Admire adorableness as he runs. Take wet ball from mouth. Rinse and repeat. See? That's not too much to ask right?\n\nTony would love to find an experienced adult companion living the single life who will take him on walks, jogs, and hikes to explore his world. He came to us from Iran as a young puppy, so he is still adjusting to all the sights, smells, and sounds of his new surroundings, but he loves the outdoors and stopping to smell all the roses. His love for toys and treats is unconditional and he'll let you pet him for as long as your hands are willing and able. Tony is wise beyond his years and has an insatiable thirst for training. He already knows sit, down, wait, shake, leave it, and has a pretty good heel too! Not bad for a 1 year old, right? As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect, so he will need someone with the time, patience, and dedication to continue reinforcing his obedience training. Tony takes some time to warm up to new people, but once he gets comfortable, watch out! He is quite the attention hog and quickly bonds with one person so he would love to find that special someone to be his designated sidekick. Tony is also working diligently on his dog manners and containing his excitement when seeing other dogs on walks. He has been attending weekly group walks and hikes with other dogs and has shown tremendous improvement around his furry friends. A fenced-in backyard to run, play fetch, and release all his puppy zoomies is on his wish list too! Tony is already house-broken and sleeps through the night without incident. He told us that his requirements are quite modest: an experienced and single-occupancy owner who will shower him with endless love and plenty of training (you), a warm spot to rest on (your lap), and cozy accommodations (your home). So, do you fit the bill? If yes, come meet Tony today and bring some love, laughs, and licks into your life!\n\nEstimated DOB: 5/11/2019\n\nSponsored by Brian McNeill",

The first thing he did on a recent trip to the off-leash run, was pick up a stuffed duck toy and proudly carry it around the run. Jupiter later alternated between carrying the duck and a stuffed octopus. He's happy to chase after toys if you throw them, but prefers holding them to bringing them back for more fetching. Jupiter can pull a bit on the leash when he first comes out of his kennel, but as soon as he gets going he settles down into a nice walking companion. He likes to sniff and explore, but doesn't stray too far from your side. He is also happy to take the occasional break for pets and snuggles. Jupiter is ready to join a fun-loving home who will have fun loving him.",

Currently he is trying to convince me that he is in fact a lap dog, lucky for him I don't mind and love that he's comfortable enough already to fall asleep. We are working on walking on the leash and will do some dog friendly intros over the next few days. He is very low maintenance. He watches hopefully but doesn't beg for food. Super dog friendly. He is a low key. He will follow you from room to room, but doesn't have to be constantly petted or on top of you.\n\nDrake was deemed PDD for an incident in 2018 due to an altercation with the neighbor dog with his buddy. Drake's life was saved a few years ago by another rescue covering his emergency medical care when he was the victim of domestic violence suffering a life threatening gunshot wound. The owner recently lost their home and was unable to keep the boys and sadly they landed on the EUTH list at the Wichita Animal Shelter and needed pulled by a rescue. Due to the PDD label they will need a home outside of Wichita, inside city limits requires a dangerous dog sign to be displayed and registration.",

            "description": "COURTESY POST\nHey everyone! We are looking for a new home for our dog Tyson. He is a 2 year old Boxer/Mastiff mix and he weighs 68 lbs. He is a very loyal, playful and sweet dog. He is potty trained he knows tricks like \u201dsit\u201d \u201cstay\u201d \u201chigh five\u201d \u201clay down\u201d He is a very obedient dog. If I hold food in front of his face, even touching his nose with it, he will not eat it until I tell him \u201ceat.\u201d He grew up with kids but is not as tolerant when food is involved and has been getting stressed out with the young children in the home. So, we are looking for a home with NO KIDS! He loves to play, is active, and loves being outdoors. He is neutered, and his up to date on his shots.  We want him to go to a good home where he will be loved. His adoption fee is $200. Please contact petadopt@hotmail.com for an application. Thank you!",

            "description": "This strikingly gorgeous boy with two different-colored eyes is Glacier. This boy came into rescue being found with a gunshot wound - he has since been treated and has recovered well, and he is more than eager to find a furever home of his own! Despite this traumatic event, Glacier is the sweetest and kindest boy. He gets along wonderfully with his foster sibling, and he is always eager to meet new friends. He is exceptionally calm and gentle around children, and he simply adores everyone who wants to meet him. Glacier's current favorite activity is getting belly rubs - he will come up in front of you, roll over on his belly, practically begging for a belly rub :) Glacier is not a big fan of car rides or thunderstorms, but a good chunk of cheese can usually help him get over it. This sweet, gentle boy has such a lovely temperament that it is hard not to fall in love with him. He is so eager to love that he will happily lie by your side until you have time to play with him. Will you be the one to show Glacier that there is plenty of love around for him too?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

In the last 6 months, he has been on medical hold due to being heartworm positive and also because he has seizures.  He received his last treatment for heartworms at the beginning of Jan.  We don't anticipate that he will need anything other than monthly preventatives in the future related to the heartworms.\n\nSlim has been treated and monitored very closely for his seizures.  His seizures were well controlled for almost three months but he has had some breakthrough seizures in the month.  He comes out of his seizures well, and generally gets back to normal within 10-15 minutes.  Any potential adopter will have to understand that he will have ongoing needs for vet care and medication related to his seizures.  It would be ideal if he could be followed by his current vet in FWB to ensure continuity in his care.  This will be a consideration when choosing a home for him.  \n\nHe is currently on a medication that has to be given every 8 hours so he will need to be in a home with adopters who can accommodate his needs.  He is on Phenobarbital and Keppra at this time.  The estimated cost of these two scripts will be around $40 a month.  Slim  takes his medicine easily with the help of pill pockets and peanut butter.  \n\nIn return for your dedication to his special needs, you will be rewarded with a FANTASTIC friend.  His foster family has fostered over 60 dogs and they say he is definitely one of the best foster dogs they have ever had.  Slim is such a polite pup, has wonderful manners, crate trained, potty trained, and gets along great with other dogs and his foster home. He has an awesome personality and demands (and deserves) to be given a lot of attention.   He is a favorite of the vets and techs at Friendship vet.  In public, he is outgoing, charming and active.  \n\nHis preferred place is sitting on your lap or burrowing under the covers.  Being allowed to sleep in the bed with his new family is a must.   His favorite activities are playing with toys,  patrolling the yard, and being with his humans.   PLEASE  don't let his medical needs scare you away from Slim. He will be such a wonderful addition to you life.   His foster mom will be happy to answer any additional questions you may have, feel free to message her at the address above.\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

Gino is so, so ready to find his people, be in a home, and be a part of a family.\n\nThis boy loves an adventure, especially if it involves water. He struggles with the Texas summer heat (don't we all!) but enthusiastically splashes around, swims, and cools off in the water any chance he gets.\n\nGino's ideal spot would be with active people with no kiddos, some dog-savvy, and who are excited and willing to partner with his team to help Gino learn how to adjust to home living! He will gladly bring his baby pool to set up in the yard too! When it comes to other dogs, he can be a lot but it could work with the right match and support as he really loves and yearns for doggy friends!\n\nMessage us or email us at orangedotcrew@gmail.com to learn more about Gino Bean!",

He's a 45-pound, 1 1/2 -year-old bundle of joy, who's up for a run, fetch, or tug-of-war at any time. If you're looking for an outdoor playmate to keep up with your fast pace, then you've found the right guy!\n\nMister Jackson is dog-friendly, housetrained, and crate trained. With all of his energy, though, he still likes to slow down a couple of times a day for a pit stop to chill in his crate and recharge. Then, he's off to the races again! He is still working on indoor manners that he never learned as a puppy. But with a bit of patience and consistent training, he'll master all of the commands in no time. He's really smart, and he's already made a lot of progress with his training.\n\nBeing young, he's curious and wants to grab what he thinks is his and play, play, play! Even though Mister Jackson likes children, he can get a little excited and mouthy, so a home with no children is best for this roadster. A fenced yard is also a must-have; he'll be able to expend some of that energy so it stays outside. And cats? Probably not\nas\nMister Jackson loves to play a little too much for kitties.\n\nMister Jackson is a very happy, friendly dog with great outside manners. He's a super pal to take hiking or to a social event. He loves walks and is ready to go in an instant! After all of his energy slows down, he'll sleep like an angel in his crate all night long - while recharging to hit the track again the next day! He needs a leader to keep up with him and dedicate the time to continue working on his training! Mister Jackson is going full throttle to the finish line. He's ready to meet you in the Winner's Circle today!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-formsPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.This big fella was originally a stray in a Missouri pound - and when his family didn't come for him, that reached out to a few rescues in Iowa to take him in and find a new forever family. He was given the name Sirius before making it to Safe Haven....but we quickly figured out his name was likely given to him because of his striking blue eyes. 'Sirius' is a greek name meaning 'glowing' and is also the name of the brightest star in the sky. 'Sirius' is also a popular character in Harry Potter that could turn into a dog - so we agree this name is perfect for our pretty unique new dog. His breed is a guess, but those big blue eyes and thick coat certainly make us think he is part Husky. Sirius is a big, solid fella that seems to love everyone he meets. We aren't quite sure if he gets along with other dogs yet, he does seem a bit reactive, but may be okay if properly introduced. We do know Sirius would love a fenced in yard or someone to jog with, as he is a very active fella and is happiest when he gets lots of exercise. He is a smart dog, knows a few basic commands and seems very willing to learn. He really wants to find 'his person' to bond strongly with and will provide a lifetime of love and devotion! ** UPDATE 1/16/21 - Sirius was adopted 5 months ago from Safe Haven. His family reports that he is a great dog that loves long walks and snuggling on the couch! What he doesn't like is being woken up.....he will growl if you wake him up. Unfortunately this behavior escalated in his adoptive home, and when one of the kids hugged a sleeping Sirius, he did react - he was startled and did bite the kid :( So Sirius was returned to Safe Haven and is looking for a dog savvy home that can respect the space that Sirius needs when sleeping.

Benny is not aggressive towards cats but he doesn't realize how big he is and will chase them trying to play! Benny is still a puppy so he loves to play, his foster mom says he is very spunky and he loves to talk! Benny will have to be walked on a leash as he loves to chase cars he\u2019s thinks he can drive. He did have an injury on his lower leg when he first came to us but it has now healed, zzz Benny will thrive as an o my dog in home as he can be selective at times with dogs.  He is not very fond of crates and he will try and break down the sides to get out but we are working on correcting that issue he loves to roam the house and be around his people.  Benny loves to try and chase anything that is moving fast, squirrels, cars, lizards so he will be a great running buddy.  He is a sucker for belly rubs! Benny does not realize his size and will jump up when excited or play a little rougher but he is not aggressive and we\u2019re working on no jump.  He is just a big teddy bear. Benny is ready to find his forever home!",

She is suffering from a linear obstruction which is extremely dangerous as the rope/string binds the intestines causing perforations and tears that will be fatal. Thanks to your generous donations we were able to cover the expense for her medical care and she is healthy and ready to go to a foster or forever.\n\nThis girl's a sweetie and already has this doggie door thing down.We learned that she is kennel trained, good with kids, other dogs but has not been around cats. She has a high energy level so will need a fenced in yard to run and play.",

Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** No other obvious issues found during vet exam *****\nTemperament:\n\nInky is another old guy needing a forever home. We'd actually like to find him a permanent foster home so that we can continue to monitor his neurological issues. Inky gets along just fine but his back legs will slip and slide on slick surfaces. (He doesn't seem to mind though.) His tongue hangs out too. We don't know why. Inky is great with everyone but he does not like big dogs. We think his bad attitude toward big dogs may be the reason for his nerve damage. Perhaps he was attacked? Inky will even give a \"side-eye\" for those demerits you get for not having dinner prepared on time.\n\n--\n\nWhere did he come from: He was a stray at the Richland Hills Animal Shelter\n\nAdoption: ***** $216.50 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 12.7 lbs.\nApproximate age: 12 years\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

At Autumn Acres Animal Rescue we believe each individual animal matters. We take in special cases some of which will stay with us as a sanctuary dog.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect Dog this means they have special needs and special requirements for potential adopters.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect RESIDENT this animal is NOT available for adoption and is one of our sanctuary residents. We list them on our sites because they still matter and they still need donations to help with their long term care.Check out our website for more information: http://www.autumnacres.org",

My tiny foster fur brother snaps at me because I'm a bit too enthusiastic, so I would like a home where I can play with another dog my own size! Probably big kids would be best for me because I'm pretty sure I will knock young children over by accident. I'm working on that as well as all of my manners and I am a quick learner. I love my crate, sit nicely for treats and I understand now that it is not good to chew TV remotes. I will just stick to the toys in my basket! I would love a family who will spend time with me, help me get the exercise I need and continue helping me with my training. My dream home would have another dog and a fence.\n\nIf you are looking to add some fun and laughter to your life, I'm your boy!\n\nIf you are looking to add some fun and laughter to your life, I'm your boy!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

I experienced my first snow and it was delicious. My foster dog brother and sister have been showing me the ropes; including chasing squirrels, the best sun bathing spots, and playing fetch. I also like playing with toys by myself, if needed. Im house broken, crate trained (if theres peanut butter), and working on my basic commands. Im pretty good walking on the leash but when there are strangers or other dogs Im very curious. I also love cuddling and like to be touching my people as much as possible. Could I cuddle with you?\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

I play well with other dogs, but I have some possessive behaviors with food and toys that would need to be managed, so I'd need to live with the right kind of dog, or be your one and only! I'm not a fan of small dogs or cats, though. I'm a big guy, but I walk very politely on leash. My ideal home would be one with occasional walks, but mostly I'm a lazy, couch potato, so I don't need a ton of exercise. \n\nPlease note- Rocky has food allergies that will need to be managed ongoing in the home. \n\nWe are currently open by appointment only \n\nAdoption fee $175\nThe adoption fee covers: Microchip, neuter, rabies, core vaccines, heartworm testing, monthly prevention, and deworming. \n\nAdoption process:\nVeterinarian reference \nLandlord Approval \nDog meet if applicable \nVirtual home visit",

Somebody loved him I think, enough to surrender him.\n.\nHe was never leash trained and may have to wear a harness, modified a bit so he can't slip it, because he has a little cough that may indicate a tracheal problem. He is great with the other dogs so far. \n\nWith people he is a fighter and a biter if pushed. Probably mostly to lack of handling and the most basic of training. So a bit of a bully who needs to be pushed out of his comfort zone a little bit at a time, every day, all day long. \n\nHe is the fastest sitter I've ever seen if you have something he wants. It's hilarious.\n\n He wants to be with people, counts on people, will get on our lap, and always comes when called when we are outside. It may be awhile before he is ready for adoption.",

            "description": "Hello. My name is Rocky, aka Rockstar aka YBT (yellow belly traitor)\u2026 read on and you'll understand. \n\nI am a middle aged (4.5 year old) hunk looking for a forever home. I am not described as tall, dark and handsome but I am the strong, silent type. I have excellent manners in the house, and do not chew or destroy anything. I love, love, love food. I will go to my bed and wait eagerly to be told its okay to go to my bowl and eat. My two favorite activities in the world are walks and car rides! I love, love, love to go for walks\u2014so much so that my favorite people in the world are the dog walkers. I\u2019m a terrific and eager car rider. I love to go on adventures. I also love to have my head, ears and butt scratched. My social skills with other dogs still need a bit of work, as does my leash work \u2013 to be honest, I pull a bit because I love to go for walks. But not everyone is perfect, right? Oh and I have allergies. I will obey basic commands quite well \u2013 sit, stay, come, back up, down, and crawl. I never try to run away, even on the rare occasions when I get the opportunity. I also don\u2019t chase anything.  And I mean nothing \u2014 not cats, not squirrels, not tennis balls, not squeaky toys, not deer, not even wild turkeys. Nothing, that is, except food.  My foster mom and foster grandma both throw kibble across the room, and I love to chase it and eat it. Truth be told, I have been known to get into the garbage if you leave it out and it smells like food, and the other day I ate a chicken sandwich that had been left on a plate on a table just my height \u2013 but, hey, what red-blooded American dog wouldn\u2019t?  My ideal future home would be with a strong, calm individual(s), who can be my leader. A leader who will take me on many long walks, preferably at a good clip, and who is happy to have me as an only dog, although I might be super happy with a submissive, non-reactive doggie friend. I also need someone who will give me a little time to trust them. Respectful children in the home should be fine, as should cats with a proper and gradual introduction. I presently live with rabbits and, although I haven\u2019t been granted the freedom to interact with them too much, I also haven\u2019t shown any interest in them \u2014 even though one of them seems to want to check me out.  If you think we might be a good match, please reach out to my friends at K9 Kismet.  \nK9 Kismet Adoption Application-https://k9kismet.org/forms/ \n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nMedical: allergies requiring allergy drops before meals and periodic veterinary. \n\nBehavior: Very quiet dog.  Calm at home, and not destructive, even when left alone.  Does well with confident people, especially those who take him places and convey that they like him.  Is a good watch dog and will warn perceived intruders.  May need time to develop trust. Is not socialized with dogs; seems to want to meet other dogs but can stare at dogs out on walks and will react if seemingly attacked. May growl if disturbed at night while resting in his bed; needs to be woken/roused verbally not through touch. When in an excited state, may forget obedience and listening skills. Pulls on leash and zigzags. He is crate trained. Has basic+ obedience, and is very food motivated, making him easy to train. He is not food possessive with people.\n\nLikes: being scratched, car rides, walks, food, and adventures, including going on vacation and staying in hotels\n",

She also was not getting along with the small dog in the house, and had been abandoned to the back yard. When Rosie arrived she overweight and unhappy; even refusing to eat. All that is in the past and now she is a happy, active young adult in good health.\n\nRosie would make a very nice companion for someone who is not too active and only wants one dog. Rosie is affectionate, likes people, and has a medium energy level. She enjoys her walks and she is not a digger or a chewer.\n\nRosie was born in September of 2016. She is crate trained.\n\nPhotos coming soon!",

That means he needs a back yard for exercise because he won't walk on a leash! Maybe he can get over that. We know that can be a challenge for a potential adopter, but we just tell the truth in hopes someone might be the right home for Gilmore!\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

If you are patient he will come to trust you but needs a calm, patient loving home. Sudden noises or movements startle him. He will not come to you when you call his name but will surrender to be picked up. If you are looking for a cuddler, this is not Louie. He also does not like his paws touched. For all of these above reasons, Louie will not be adopted to a home with children.\n\nHe lives in a foster home with several other dogs which are all larger then him. He gets along with them but does try to boss them around when they will let him. He does not share his food and will warn anyone coming near his bowl. Louie is crated at night and will go in during the day when he needs quiet time. He is learning to walk on a leash and does ride in the car well.\n\nLouie has been neutered, is up to date on shots, microchipped, flea treated and dewormed. His adoption fee is $200.00 to cover his vetting costs. If you are interested, please go to mendingfencesca.org to complete an application. 1/27/21 2:26 AM",

He is definitely Beagley, but seems to be a bit larger and longer than normal so there could be some Basset mixed in. Whatever breed he may be he is about the sweetest guy you'd ever want to meet. He is also quiet, which we really appreciate. He is wonderful with the other dogs, loves to go for rides, is house trained and fine with children. He is with us because his human father had to take a job where he would be away for 10-12 hours a day and this was back in 2014.\n\nMax was adopted a few times and always returned. The first time is was because he couldn't be alone and it was much less alone than he was used to. Then the next two times we found humans home much or all the time and then their lives changed. When Max came back the third time and realizing what was happening and it was obvious his heart was hurting our amazing team of volunteers asked us to not put him back up for adoption and let him be a sanctuary pet at Joyful Rescues. Which he has been and he is very, very, happy here with all the dogs and there is at least one human here at ALL times. A volunteer once thought she'd try to foster him and found that she could not even take a shower without him becoming destructive trying to get to her. So, Max came back the same day. We LOVE this guy and he LOVES the volunteers and staff at the main location - Max is living his best life - the best life for him.\n\nSPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet.\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "Tracer came from a hoarding situation where, as a puppy, she was kept in a large, dirty pen with many other dogs. She was not socialized with people, so she is generally a shy dog. She is very sweet once she settles in, and she LOVES going for runs! Any home for Tracer would need to walk or run with her and preferably have another playful dog.\n\nTracer would be most comfortable in a harmonious household with someone who stays home, more than they are away. She also loves other dogs and would really like a doggie friend to play with. Anyone getting to know her, really needs to give her about 3 weeks to settle in. Once she does, we promise she will not disappoint! She would prefer a home without small children. \n\nIf you are reading this, we are still accepting applications on this pet. \n\nOur Adoption Process:\n\n\n\tMeet the Adoption Criteria. Before you do anything else, make sure you meet our adoption criteria. You must be at least 21 years old. You must live within a 60-mile radius of Richardson, Texas. You must share veterinary records for all pets currently in your home and all pets owned in the last five years. All pets in the home must be spayed or neutered. If you rent your home, you must provide verification that pets are allowed on the property. You must be willing to be interviewed by an adoption counselor and you must undergo an in person or virtual home visit from an RHS representative.\n\tComplete Application. https://www.richardsonhumanesociety.org/adopt/\n\tPhone Interview. Compatible applicants will be forwarded to a counselor who will contact the applicant for a phone interview.\n\tHome Visit. If all the steps above are completed satisfactorily, we will set up a visit where you can meet the pet you are interested in. We will try to include the foster parent so you can learn more about how the pet is in a home environment.\n\tComplete Adoption. If all feel it is a good match, we will schedule the adoption at your home or an off-site location. The applicant will need to complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies (under 1 year) and $125 for cats. Discounts are available for senior-aged pets.",

            "description": "Poor Brandie (see my other photos & watch my video new video!) was neglected matted thin had no vet care and lived in a backyard. She was shy and nervous at the shelter and hid in the corner of her cage. With time staff were able to take her out and carry/pet her. She was ok and ignored other dogs but too distracted to interact. She has had no training and is under-socialized. She needs time to get healthy with holistic/fresh foods learn home training and get groomed. More info. to come while she gets TLC at her foster home. NOTE: She needs a very experience adult home with yard. No other dogs. Growls at other dogs. No kids. She has fear issues.\n8/24/20 update: Brandie is very scared at her foster home and will growl when approached by them or their small dog. She needs time to decompress get healthy learn 'home living' and to trust people. She will not walk on leash. Needs grooming and then her spay surgery. Brandie will need weeks to month of rehab so she will not be available for a few weeks to month. No apartments for her. She needs experienced adult home with attached backyard for potty biz. No apt. In a few weeks when she feels safe and we learn more about her personality we will contact matching applicants. She needs a very experienced guardian and adult home only.\n9/7/20: Video of her finally feeling safe and happy. Still using pee pads and learning house-training. She is still scared to be leashed and won't go out for walks yet. She is great with husband. Still afraid of collar and won't walk on leash. Need to work on house-training to go to yard. Need very patient and experienced guardian. She growls at the foster home's dog still. So home with no other dog.\n10/11/20: Now with single lady foster home. She warmed up with foster mom. Active inside home. Need home with yard to continue to try to get her out. Still using pee pads in the house and afraid to be leashed for walks. She is still fearful of other dogs and will growl at them. Will need more time. Need very experience adult-only home.\n10/29/20: She is now totally relaxed at home but she is not the cuddle type she ran away when trying to hug her. She is comfortable going out to the yard by herself now. We just started to have short walk outside the house about 10 minutes she was very scared at first shaking and pooping. But after a while she is ok. She is not good with toys. She chewed off pieces tried to swallow. She likes to play with the tennis ball. Also she runs away each time I have something on hand except food. She has a collar now it still takes a while to hook on the leash. Seems not possible to wipe her or comb her. She can go to bathroom indoor and outdoor. But for outdoor there must be no access to the wee pad then she will go outside. If she has a choice she will use the pad. I left the patio door open so she can go anytime. There are home visits with other dogs she was very scare and hide away. She is definitely a work in progress still but has come a long way.\n12/22/20: Brandie is now going out to walk no problem. We go out two times a day. She is not a cuddle type as of now she stays on my lap for about 8-10 minutes and wants to go back to the floor. Not ready for belly rub. I tried to clean her paws after walks she is not happy and growls and tried to nip. Her bed is her territory once she is in she will growl and even tried to nip if you disturb her (petting or putting blanket on her) She is a sweet girl but you must know her character a strong leader will be good for her. When we walk outside and meet other dogs she shakes a lot and hides behind me when the other dogs come to her even other people just talk to me she is shaking and hiding behind me. We went hiking she has no problem as long as we don't see any other dogs.YouTube: https://youtu.be/PzRnRFfNcvY",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Josie\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 54 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Yes\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: Heartworms\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n9/20/20: Josie is a super sweet girl who is still coming out of her shell. She has warmed up to women faster then men, but is finally trusting of my husband now. She has been around dogs of all sizes and breeds, as well as kittens, and has done fantastic with them. She is not food aggressive at all, and knows her own bowl. She is crate trained and house trained, and uses our dog door like a champ. She is currently not fond of walking on a leash outside of the backyard, but we are working on that and she is getting better with time and patience. She loves to snuggle on the couch with you, and has just started to show her playful side with my senior male boxer. We are still trying to put weight on her since she is not super food motivated. Josie loves her dog toys, and loves on them instead of destroying them. She will be ready for adoption after her heartworm treatment is complete in a few months, and would do best in a home with another dog.\n\n8/24/20: Welcome Josie to CBR. More to come as she gets settled into her foster home!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nHi there! My name is\n\nTiger\n\nand I am almost two years old. I get along with other dogs and I am pretty well housebroken. I am good when left alone, but prefer to be near my person as much as possible. I will play with some squeaky toys, but I prefer attention and cuddling, one could call me a lap dog. Don't get me wrong though, for, as much as I love to cuddle I still do have a lot of energy that I need to get out of me so I have higher than average exercise needs\n\n! I do enjoy being outside and do pretty well on leash though I might prefer a harness over a collar. I have been on some car rides and enjoy them. I might be excited at first, but if you ask me to stay in the backseat I will. Overall I would be a good addition to the right person or family, but I do need someone that can work with me on basic manners (I jump up when I get excited) and continue learning good behaviors so an experienced dog owner who is very familiar with my breed\nis a must. I am not a fit with\nchildren or cats.\nI will also definitely need a 6 foot fence as I am a bit of an escape artist!\n\nTigers adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS a free obedience course at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be current on preventatives and vaccinations and be altered. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit. Please submit an adoption application for consideration at www.adopthope.org.",

            "description": "MEDICAL HOLD - NOT AVAILABLE \nMerlin is a 1 year old male Cocker Spaniel and Poodle Mix (our best guess) rescued from a shelter and heartworm positive. He will need to go through expensive and painful treatment that will take a few months. Once treated and cleared by our vet, he will be available for adoption. This probably won\u2019t be until after the first of the year 2021. If you would like to donate toward his care, please visit our website www.luv4k9s.org and select the Donate button for our PayPal account. \n\nHe will not be available for adoption until treatment is complete. At that time, if you think you would be interested in adopting him please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

She has had a tough life (she looks a disaster- stained, scarred and calloused), but is the happiest, sweetest, most care free girl you could ever meet! She has a great spirit and she is always smiling and tail wagging! Izzy loves her dog pal friends (her size and larger, has not been around small dogs while in our care) and considerate people of all ages, even though she is like a little bull in a china shop,haha. However, NO KITTIES please, she is not a fan! Izzy does not like the crate, but has acclimated pretty well with treat motivation. She cannot go long periods of time without going outside to pee. It does not seem to be a medical issue, we think she was most likely always a outdoor dog and not custom to indoor life. She is a strong little gal, walks fairly well on leash most times though. Izzy is pretty active for her age, but also enjoys lounging at your feet and on her bed.\n\nIsadora does suffer from chronic ear issues that require daily medication to keep her comfortable, the years and years of neglect make it impossible to remedy the situation, just manage it. Other than that she will not take much to keep happy and comfortable and we guarantee this gal is well worth it! In addition to being spayed, heart worm tested and up to date on vaccines, we recently had a full dental cleaning done!\n",

Darla has been treated and is healthy and ready for a new home now. Darla absolutely loves people - ALL of them, kids included. However, she does not care for other animals and would do best as the only pet in the home. Darla LOVES toys and used to carry around a squeaky rubber cow until he fell apart. She is very smart and willing to please her person. She is active and would do best in a home where she gets lots of play time.\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

            "description": "Blue is one of the most beautiful Chows we ever did see. We don't know much about her past, but we can tell by her demeanor that she likely has a pretty horrible story to tell. If only dogs could speak to us. We pulled Blue from South Carolina at the beginning of the year. We were told she was food aggressive, but that didn't scare us because we have worked with that many times before. We don't know if the traveling north changed her (sometimes the trip can traumatize a dog) or if the previous shelter was not completely truthful about her behaviors. The first few days we had her we could not safely touch her. She never bit us, but we also didn't give her the chance to. We could tell by her body language that she wanted nothing to do with us. We decided to give her a few days to decompress because sometimes that is all a dog needs. She did get better after a few days. She began letting us slip lead her and we were learning to understand her body language better. Her play often appeared aggressive to us, so we had to learn how to tell the difference. She was a bad cage fighter and would freak out in her kennel if she had food and someone walked by. One time she did bite one of our employees when we were putting her food down for her. Thankfully it was more of a warning bite and she didn't break skin. She immediately released and backed up because she knew she had done something wrong. It was at this point that we realized her only hope was a professional trainer. Thankfully she got extremely comfortable with our director. Our director could handle her without a problem, feed her, bathe her, and really do anything to her. This showed us that there is hope for this sweet girl. She just needed to learn that life isn't as scary as she thinks.\n\nWe got Blue enrolled with an amazing trainer. He evaluated her and determined that there is hope for her. As soon as he gave us the okay, we enrolled her in his board and train program. She has been there for a little over a month and will be spending about another month there. She has made huge improvements. She is playing with other dogs, she doesn't give them a hard time about going in and out of her kennel and she is learning to not be protective over her food. She is a completely different dog than the once scared and aggressive girl we knew. \n\nBlue will need a special type of owner. One that is going to stick with her training and not let her become the boss. She needs to know who is in charge so that she doesn't go back to the way she was. We don't think it would be safe for Blue to share a home with a child at this time, but we will update if that changes. We think she could happily live with another dog, but we don't know how she is with cats. She would love a huge yard to play in and people to play games with. Whoever adopts Blue will get multiple training sessions with her trainer before taking her home, that way they know everything she needs. The sessions will be paid for by us. \n\nBlue's adoption fee is $500. She will require 5 visits to our facility with our trainer before going home. Once she is home, we will have our trainer visit 3-5 times to help her adjust. We will cover the cost of these 10 training sessions.",

I am happy, lively, and quite a comical fellow.  I am a sprightly, fun fusion of Boxer and Husky and at only 2 1/2 years old - yes, I am an active guy and at only around 45 pounds I am a great sized bundle of fun.  \nI'm not looking to haunt a mansion but I definitely need a hang out with a secure fenced yard so I can run and play and haunt to my heart's content.  I love my toys and I love to play with my doggy friends and would so love to have a doggy sib to keep me busy and out of trouble.  I do quite well with the kitty friends as well.  I've had a lot to learn in this new and wonderful re-birth here and have been busy at working hard on all those humanly type manner things but I still do need lots of patience, a sense of humour and positive handling from my spirit guides to be my best self.   \nNow!  If you are ready to learn more and possibly haunt along with friendly, comical, sprightly me please review the details on how we might possibly haunt together!\n\nGhost's adoption fee is $400.  He has been neutered, fully vaccinated, heart worm & tick diseases tested negative & preventatives given for the season.  Please review his bio and  If you feel you are the special person or family to welcome Ghost into your heart and home **PLEASE COMPLETE** the application found at this link - https://form.jotform.com/72823870527260  to open discussions and learn more about our rescue and adoption process.  A volunteer will be happy to help you and we just request your patience as we are volunteers doing our best to handle all the day to day needs of our dogs, our busy rescue and our families. \n**PLEASE NOTE** that we adopt only within the province of Ontario and preference will be given to potential adopters within our local areas provided they qualify and are the best fit for our dog.\nThanks everyone!",

            "description": "*** SAMMY'S ADOPTION HAS BEEN PAID FOR BY A DONATION FROM TIM PANTLE *** FOSTER PLACEMENT PARAMETERS The best way to describe Sammy is like a very excitable puppy in a much older body. He's full of curiosity, excitement, and an energy level matched with a 2-month-old puppy. And with that mindset he often uses his paws and mouth, getting more rowdy than usual. Getting his attention and directing him energy out in healthy ways helps him flourish in his personality. This behavior he shows is likely to follow him throughout his lifetime. Regular exercise, enrichment, and help with some training on impulse control will be great for him in the long run. He can also get a little startled if you sneak up and touch him, its important to let him know of your presence before engaging with him. He's sweet boy and would be a good fit for a home ready for someone with special needs. Personality: Mellow and a treat lover. This guy has been through it! He is looking for a place that he can live in the lap of luxury which this nugget truly deserves. He would be totally content hanging out with you and watching the world go by. He would also enjoy the occasional walk of course. He is also hard of hearing so hand signals are going to be super helpful for him. Dogs: Tolerant female Cats/Small Animals: No small animals due to high arousal Children: No, due to high arousal during play/mouthiness Energy Level: low to moderate Food/Object Possession: No aggression seen Separation Anxiety: Severe seperation anxiety. Potty Trained: unknown The best way to describe Sammy is like a very exctiable puppy in a much older body. Hes full of curiousity, ***Behavior may change once in a stable home environment. This is a summary of behaviors noticed and tested for during the animals stay at the shelter.***",

            "description": "Miss Sophia is a previous St. Cloud Rescue dog that was adopted and recently returned, due to a family moving.  Sophia has been loved and lived with a family with children.  Sophia is a gorgeous full Saint Bernard that is approximately 6 years old.  Sophia does well with most dogs, however, she would also do well as an only dog.  Either can work depending on how the dogs react to each other.  Sophia weighs approximately 120 pounds and is current on all vaccinations, spayed, heartworm negative and housetrained.  She enjoys baths and doesn\u2019t mind having her nails clipped.  If you have ever dreamed of a beautiful, show quality Saint, Sophia could be your dream companion.\n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5. This is due to the large size of Saint Bernards and the safety of your children. Our Saint Bernards are not aggressive or mean in any way, they can just knock down children easily. If you would like to visit our pups please contact St. Cloud's Rescue at www.stcloudsrescue.org or call 972-679-5319. The first step in adopting from St. Cloud's Rescue is to complete an application. The application may be found OUR WEBSITE at www.stcloudsrescue.org. Please click on the application process, complete and then email it. Once the application has been sent please call us to confirm that we have received it. St.Cloud's Rescue maintains the right to deny applications to anyone for any reason we see fit. St. Cloud Rescue is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization. St. Clouds Rescue requires new owners to purchase a one year supply of heartworm preventative from us, which is at cost. We require a home visit prior to all placements. All our dogs must be microchipped at a cost of $20.00. There is a $250.00 donation fee. All dogs adopted through St Clouds Rescue must be indoors. St. Bernards can not tolerate the Texas heat.",

Four wood walls and to many other lonely dogs is the only thing he has known. It was obvious that toby had very little human interaction. Toby is house trained and crate trained and has a strange connection with a certain orange ball. We are looking for a home with someone who is wanting to spend time working and training him as he is behind where he should be. He was never socialized around people or places and this has him fearful at first, so he will need a handler who will make him feel safe and keep strangers informed. He also will need a home with carpeting, he can not walk on hardwood or tile floors. Due to the fact he is a little uncoordinated and not use to it. His favorite things to do are playing fetch and playing in the water of any kind especially the baby pool. Since Toby is not comfortable in public a fenced in yard is a must. He needs training walking on a leash and can be hesitant in public places so a quiet neighborhood is recommended. He is good with other dogs of all sizes outside the home but he will need to be the only dog for now.. We are not sure about cats, but he doesn't seem to have a prey drive, can get excited seeing one once in a while but mostly - ignores them. A home with no children is recommended. Toby is a happy boy and loves being in the house with his foster mom, he has so much potential with the right person. \n\nPlease visit our website at http://www.gsror.com/adoptionapp/ to complete an online application.",

            "description": "Sweet Tiffany just turned a year old. She was rescued as a stray from the streets in Houston Texas at the age of just 2 months and brought to Colorado. Adopted quickly because of her remarkable beauty and spunky personality, Tiffany was reported as a wonderful puppy with tons of energy and a passion for long hikes and playing in her back yard. Tiffany is now crate trained and potty trained. She is highly intelligent and quickly picks up basic commands such as sit, lay down, off, leave it, stay, and release. She is motivated by both praise and treats. Tiffany has a goofy personality and quickly bonds with new people. Tiffany wll guard your yard intently from any resident squirrels or neighboring cats, so her prey drive would prevent her from living harmoniosly with any canine friends. \n\nAs an adolscent, Tiffany was unfortunately, attacked by another dog. She can (understandably) be a bit leary if strange dogs approach her inappropriately or too quickly, but she has since learned to start trusting her handlers and quickly warms now once she is properly introduced to new friends! Tiffany would thrive in a home with a yard to run in and a family that will keep her entertained and occupied. She does enjoy her downtime in her crate and has no issue keeping herself calm/occupied. Tiffany thrives on the attention from her favorite people and will certainly fill any home completely with copious amounts of love and loyalty. \n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out if you are interested in meeting or learning more about this sweet gal that deserves a second chance in a home where she feels loved and protected! She is waiting to meet you!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Due to some separation anxiety, the behaviorist has suggested Bodhi be adopted to a home with at least one other dog. He is comforted by the company. We are also looking for a home where Bodhi will get lots of exercise. He would make a great hiking partner and is great in the car. Bodhi prefers to spend lots of time with his human, so someone with lots of time for Bodhi would be great. He is crate trained and housebroken too! He's 4 years old, neutered, vaccinated and heart worm negative. Can you give Bodhi the special home he needs?",

An 87 year old Good Samaritan fed Maverick and his friends ever since he was a puppy.\n\nMaverick has adjusted well to life indoors and he definitely loves the a/c!\n\nHe's a bit shy initially so we're looking for an adopter who is willing to give him time to adjust and settle in so you can see his goofball personality emerge! He has a fun, playful side as well as a chill and let's lounge or take a nap side.\n\nMaverick's adoption fee is $225 plus tax and that covers his vaccinations, microchip, neuter and he's on heartworm prevention. Here's the link to turn in your application and read more about our adoption process: https://www.thestreetdogproject.org/adopt\n\nWe estimate he was born around Feb 2018 and he's about 55 lbs.\n\nPlease email placement@thestreetdogproject.org if you have any questions, thanks! 2/2/21 3:35 PM",

I love women too but I really enjoy my guy buddies and hanging out in the man cave. \n\nI was left at the shelter by my original owner with a note that she couldn\u2019t keep me. Just left me out front outside of the shelter :( \n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe anyone could do that to me since I am such a good, kind and silly guy.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s the congenital abnormalities in my rear legs that she, and adoption applicants have turned away from? \n\nMy rear knees knock together due to my knees and hips being out due to bad breeding and congenital abnormalities subsequent because of it. I am not a candidate for orthopedic surgery or my rescue would have done it. \n\nHonestly, I am not very bothered by my legs and I still play,  go for walks or just chill on my big cushiony bed. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting me please first complete an adoption application at: www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInterested in adopting? If so, please complete an adoption application first at www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html\n\nAll Delaney's Dog adoption fees include :\n-Up-to-date vaccinations\n**Puppies receive 3 sets of DHPP & rabies vaccine. \n-Spay/neuter\n-Microchip & microchip registration\n\nThe adoption process requires an initial approved Adoption Application, a home visit to ensure safety and well-being of adoptee & a separate Adoption Agreement.\n\n**Adoption fees vary and are NOT NEGOTIABLE. \n\nNOTE: An Adoption Application does not guarantee an adoption. Adoptions are based on the best possible situation for each dog and their prospective owners. Not all breeds are right for all people and not all people are right for all breeds. Our commitment is to place these animals in the right homes so that they never again have to face re-homing. They deserve a forever family too.\n\nAdditionally, each adoption includes a one week, partial fee refundable, trial period to ensure pet is a right fit.\n\nNO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS",

            "description": "Maggie is a little leery of strangers, but very lovable once she gets to know a person and they've earned her trust. She's great with other dogs of all sizes and loves to play and wrestle with them. She does not require a ton of exercise, but does love to go for walks and play ball or tug. She's the perfect mix of active and lazy. She would do best in a home with no young children. She requires a slow, steady approach from people and can be a bit defensive to a fast approach from a person who has not gained her trust. Ongoing training will be necessary as she settles into her new home. She is a smart girl and very motivated by food, and is fun to train with. She is crate trained and is almost completely potty trained. Getting her on a routine quickly will make her potty training easy to finish. Foster will assist with her transition into the right home, including help with training.",

During dis crazy pandemic, I went to stay wit a foster family for a while. My foster mom got to know me real good. She says I'm special because I like all da attention for myself.\n\nI liked to play with my foster broda but he was the only one (mom says he was a basset mix, whatever dat is!) I didn't like my foster sister or my tiny foster broda. If dey have da treats...I wants dem and I will take dem when foster mom's not looking! That's when we have problems even with my basset friend. Oh, I also don't like da cats, dey make me bark a lot!\n\nWhat can foster mom tell you about me? Well, I'm real good at finding squirrels! I will bark when I pick up on a scent, cuz dat's my job! I like my elbows scratched and I like kisses on my nose! I like to look up and see what's all around me, Foster mom thinks dat's silly!\n\nWhen it's thundering out, I get scared, so mom puts dis weird thundershirt on me, but I feel better when she does! I like to snuggle when I'm scared and will lie on top of you.\n\nI needs help with da potty business, so mom got me some really pretty diapers to wear. Most days I don't needs dem, but as soon as I am done eating, I have to be told to go outside or I forget myself and have an accident. Foster Mom says I need lots of one on one time wit my furever family. She says she wishes for me to be an only furbaby, cuz she thinks that's best. She thinks I deserve lots and lots of attention.\n\nI would love to go for walks wit you and shows you where da squirrels are hiding. I am really smart too, but I need help to learn new things, can you believes I don't know how to sits? I need lots of love, and have lots of love to give.\n\nLove,\nHarriet Primary Color: Tri Color Weight: 53lbs Age: 11yrs 1mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed",

What we provide is our best estimates based on our experience and the information provided by the our medical partners.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, ALL animals are fostered and available for adoption on Long Island, NY.\nMaybeline is about 5 years old and 47 pounds. She is sweet and timid at first, but quickly relaxes and is eager for affection. She is house trained and is ok with other dogs if she is allowed a slow introduction. Maybeline loves to give kisses and is always wagging her tail. She would do best in a home with older kids and we are uncertain about cats at this time.\n\nAt the time of adoption a donation is required before the animal is placed in an adoptive home.\n\n$400 - All dogs\n\n$250 - For dogs deemed seniors by LCAR (generally 7 yrs and older)\n\n$150 - For senior citizens (over 65 yrs of age) adopting senior dogs\n\n$150 - For Saint Francis Farm Resident dogs\n\n$150 - For Kittens\n\n$100 - For Cats\n\n*IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ANIMAL, PLEASE SUBMIT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION\n(\n\nDog\n\n/\n\nCat\n\n)\nAND ONCE APPROVED, SOMEONE FROM THIS ORGANIZATION WILL CONTACT YOU. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PET IS LISTED ABOVE.",

He will take time to build a strong, trusting bond with his person. For this reason, we will require multiple visits with Buddy prior to him being adopted and therefore applicants local to the Des Moines area (or close) are preferred. His ideal home would be with a patient and experienced owner, no young children, and a fenced in yard (Buddy will take time to trust new people putting a leash on him). Buddy does well with other dogs after a proper introduction, but would prefer a furry friend to be lower energy like himself. Buddy is well house trained, but does not prefer the kennel. He is not destructive so gets free range of his foster home. Buddy also has had a couple seizures and is currently on phenobarbital (roughly $30 per month prescription). Buddy is around 30 pounds and 4 years old. His adoption fee is $250. Apply at www.foreverhomedogs.org to meet him!All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. \n\nSenior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

I love to play with toys, other dogs and be active, but at the end of the day, I like to cuddle on the sofa. I like to tuck my head under your chin while you pet and hug me, and I like to examine your whole face. On walks, I like to sniff all the flowers and meet all the people. In fact, sometimes I have to be reminded to exhale. I want to be on your lap, or hanging my head out your car window. But mostly I want to be with my human and meeting other humans because I haven't met any I don't love.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

Hydee has lived most of her life on the streets. We followed her for weeks through the dangerous streets of St. Louis and after a lot of careful planning, finally trapped her. She spent a lot of time at Hyde Park, hence the name Hydee. She has acclimated to becoming a house dog very well. Of course it took a lot of time and patience because she was scared and not too trusting. We quickly learned food was the key to her heart.  \n\nHydee\u2019s perfect family would be someone who has the understanding and patience needed to acclimate a shy and skittish dog to a new environment. We prefer Hydee have a tall privacy fence. We believe she will do well with another dog in the home as long as the dog is calm and mellow. We also believe Hydee will do well with older kids or teens but feel young kids and toddlers may be too overwhelming for her. She is house and kennel trained and loves being a couch potato. Hydee also loves to go on walks but would need a quiet park or neighborhood because loud noises will scare her. \n\nHydee is a very sweet girl. She loves her foster family and has bonded very well with them. We are looking for a forever family that she can do the same with. \n\nHydee\u2019s, adoption fee is $275. This includes spay, vaccines, microchip, dewormer and maintaining heartworm prevention while in our care. Hydee also went through heartworm treatment and it will be crucial for her to be on monthly prevention. \n\nIf you would like to be selected for a meeting with our girl, please submit an online adoption application by copying the link below into your browser. \n\nhttps://form.jotformpro.com/50153632350949\n\n",

He had a home until addiction took over his life. \n\nMax attaches himself to his person and beside them all the time. We have had him for a bit getting him used to all the commotion of an active house. He wants to eat in the bedroom because that is where he was eating in the dark. He seems sad when his person leaves for an extended period of time but bounces back when back to routine. He is very much about routine and knows the feeding schedule and makes sure you do not forget it is time to give him yummys... he bounces around and barks. He sleeps with my daughter on her bed along with her cat. That being said he gets along with dogs and cats. He likes being part of the pack and still has play in him. \n\nHe is such a sweet boy who deserves to relax and enjoy his life.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

But he is not a pooch that\u2019s going to let some little thing like paralysis get him down! He made a remarkable recovery and can now walk, run, jump and do almost everything that any other pup can do! \n\nHowever, he is still semi incontinent and while he is getting better at controlling his bowels and bladder, he is still having some issues. Because he is improving, we can\u2019t say if he will make a full recovery or not. But all this means is that he may need to wear a belly band and diaper in the house. Similar to having a toddler :) \n\nAll Hasso wants now is to find a home to call his own with a person or family that will love him. Will you be that home?",

Thank goodness he's now in a loving ATDR foster home where he's receiving the veterinary care he's been deprived of way too long. Rocky has now undergone surgery for the hematoma and has had a serious dental. He's finished with heart worm treatments so ready to go when you are. Rocky would love a quiet place where he can hang with his humans and soak up the love he deserves. He isn't a busy or active boy but a calm and thoughtful guy who just wants to be loved.\n\nIn the meantime, Rocky will be dreaming of a loving forever home with his very own person or people as he continues his journey to better health. If you would like to have a fine boy to share life's moments with, please submit an adoption application for Rocky. He'll be ready to fill that spot in your heart and lap that only a precious pup can.",

            "description": "Jethro and Rose are two awesome dogs that find themselves homeless and in need. Bonded, together since puppies their family moved away and couldn\u2019t take them. They are all that's left and want to stay together. They need our help and asking a family out there to open up their home in welcoming them into their lives, so they can remain together.\n\n\nJethro (black) is approx. 7-9 years old, 67 pounds, who is shy at first, but then loves to be petted, head scratches and enjoys plenty of attention; from people. Jethro is sweet and loving. He loves giving handshakes. He is gentle and tolerates young children well. Loves going on walks, enjoys the water, plays a little with toys but then loses interest quickly, but enjoys play with his sister. Jethro along with his sister Rose were raised as outside dogs all of their lives but we won\u2019t adopt outside dogs so in his foster home he has quickly learned to live inside and enjoys indoor living. He will alert you when he has to go potty and is house broken. Jethro is learning cues like sit, stay and come and already shakes. He and his sibling will require a large fenced yard where he can stretch his legs when not going on walks to run off energy. Jethro is not fond of other male dogs but he does well with females. Jethro is not good with cats. Jethro unfortunately did test positive for heartworms but he is currently undergoing treatment at no cost to the potential adopter. Jethro is deserving and would love a forever home with his most loyal companion his sister Rose.\n\nWe are currently accepting application for Jethro and Rose to apply please go to complete our online pre-adoption application\n\nJethro and Rose have been spayed/neutered, up-to-date on all vaccines, heartworm tested; Rose placed on prevention and Jethro undergoing heartworm treatment currently. Both will be microchipped before going to their forever home. Both will be available to go to a home once Jethro has completed his treatment.",

My owner loves me, but due to changes in her life, she will no longer have enough time for me and wants to find a good home for me.  \n\nI am used to having a home where I am loved and well fed.  I am house trained.\n\nI am probably some type of shepherd / lab mix and weigh about 65 pounds.\n\nI am a very laid back dog and enjoy lots of pets and just hanging out by you.\n\nI don't always seem to get along with my other dogs but cats don't bother me in the slightest. So I would do best in a home where I was the only dog.\n\nI am a very gentle dog.\n\nI have good manners and don't jump on you ever.\n\nSince I have low energy, I don't need a large yard, but I do require a fenced in yard.  I am a very smart (street smart) dog, and a little bit of an escape artist, so you would need to be very careful to make sure that I am always supervised outside and make sure that I was secured.\n\nWe are working on basic commands and walking well on a leash.\n\nIf you are looking for a best friend just to hang out with you I am your guy.\n\nThe adoption fee includes age-appropriate vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip!\n\nPlease click on the link for our:\nOnline Adoption Application:  https://paawarren.org/adopt/adoption-application-form/\nAdoption Info:  https://paawarren.org/adopt/adoption-fees/\nWebsite and other info:  https://paawarren.org/\n",

She\u2019s a typical lab, full of energy even at her age. She is playful, energetic, loving, a protective dog, and very smart. Loves going on walks, enjoys the water, plays a little with toys but then loses interest quickly, but enjoys play with her brother. Rose at first when ready to go on a walk gets super excited, but after 15 minutes she will calm down and enjoy the walk. Rose longs for affection since being an outside dog that had not been given much affection over the years. Rose along with her brother has adapted quickly to living inside and is housebroken. Rose has quickly picked up cues like sit, stay and shake. She gets along with all dogs male or female; however she is not good with cats. She is gentle and tolerates young children well. Rose along with her brother will require a large fenced in yard to play in when they aren\u2019t going on walks. Rose and her sibling are so deserving of a forever home that will give them the best days of their life!\n\nJethro and Rose are two awesome dogs that find themselves homeless and in need. Bonded, together since puppies their family moved away and couldn\u2019t take them. They are all that's left and want to stay together. They need our help and asking a family out there to open up their home in welcoming them into their lives, so they can remain together.\n\nWe are currently accepting application for Jethro and Rose to apply please go to complete our online pre-adoption application\n\nJethro and Rose have been spayed/neutered, up-to-date on all vaccines, heartworm tested; Rose placed on prevention and Jethro undergoing heartworm treatment currently. Both will be microchipped before going to their forever home. Both will be available to go to a home once Jethro has completed his treatment.\n\n\n",

He was returned to BarkVille for chasing the toddlers in his home and nipping at their feet (typical puppy stuff, but maybe a home with older kids would be best until he fully learns his manners).  He is a curious, sweet, intelligent dog who will bring joy & laughter into your home with his playful puppy antics! He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nFor more information about Dill, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

He's the perfect easy-going boy in every waythe distinguished little gentleman he looks like in his photos!

            "description": "03/02/20 - Ranger Mouse may be an older gentleman at 13, but he's still very spry and full of life! He wags his whole body, not just his tail, and he's pretty much in a state of perpetual wag when you're petting him. He rubs his whole body on you and gives lots of kisses. He's still able to jump on and off the couch and bed. However ...\n\nWe found him as a malnourished stray (no microchip or tags) with horribly infected teeth in Jan 2019. When we took him to be neutered it was found that his testicles had never descended. This can cause health issues so he needed to have exploratory surgery to have them removed. He gained weight and we were able to to do his neuter surgery, and a dental surgery to do a full mouth extraction by a canine dental specialist due to his fragile jaw.\n\nEarly on he was having seizures and we felt we could help him overcome them. We have been working with our vet to control them with medications. But we are continuing to need to change the doses and get him ongoing blood work (monitors his internal organs for possible issues with the medication). Unfortunately his seizures continue despite the medication. \n** We have chosen to call him a Forever Friend and put him into Hospice care with his foster. **\n\nWe are asking his friends and followers for donations for his continued care of anti seizure and anti nausea medications, blood work and special diet. \n\nIf you can help our group give Ranger Mouse continued hospice care we would be very grateful. There are several ways to donate:\n\n1. Via PayPal directly - https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1432464\n\n2. Via Facebook using this link and clicking the \"\"Donate\"\" button under the cover photo (on right) which allows Facebook Pay, PayPal or credit card one-time or monthly donations - \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ForgottenFriendsMixBreedRescue/\n\n3.

We will never forget watching as she had her macerated leg cleaned and dressed.  She endured the pain with unbelievable quiet strength.  Now Tia is healed and ready to live a life of leisure.  If you would like to provide Tia with the gift of a comfortable safe home, please contact us to arrange a meeting.",

He is medium to high energy and loves to play.\nHe is jumpy in his kennel and will bark at dogs passing by, but we've learned that is just his excitement to get out and meet them. Pizza was our helper dog in the yard for hours. He was happy and social, and would try and get even the toughest dog to play. He'd pull out all the moves.\n\nHe was social and friendly with both male and female dogs, adjusted his energy level and play to fit his play buddy at the time. Pizza is starting his training under our prison program (8/21/20) to work on his basic commands and leash manners, he does really well in his crate.\n\nPizza will be an amazing addition to your family!\n\nAdopt Pizza!",

With an experienced dog owner and someone willing to put in a little time, he can begin his transition home. He is over 100 lbs so his new owner will need to be able to physically handle 110 lbs of fun on a leash. \n\nIn the meantime, he's learning how to greet other dogs and new people. He's also working on his weight. So far, he's lost a lot of weight since he arrived and is looking and feeling much better! Whew! Feels pretty awesome to shed some pounds. He can move now! \n\nGive us a shout to learn more about Duke's needs. After a meeting or two with our trainers and a little extra time getting to know him..... he'll warm your heart. He's a character! \n\nHis ideal home is low stimulus with an active, calm, loving leader. Duke comes with ongoing post adoption support and a team of people ready to help you and your new co-pilot build a bond geared for success!",

He's friendly and loving, yet with a little bit of an independent side too. Patches is friendly with other dogs while on leash. Due to his age though, he should only come into contact with calm, dog friendly dogs. Inside the home, he really loves his toys and treats to himself so he has asked to be the only apply of your eye. No other dogs in the home please. \n\nThis boy is such an explorer and really loves to get out and sniff around. He's very well behaved inside the home and would love nothing more than to keep you company during the day! He can help with yard work, watching your favorite TV show and so much more. Have an extra spot on your couch and in your heart for a wonderful senior companion? Patches may be your guy! \n\nAhhh, with the joys of older age comes sensitives to being touched on his back legs and back end. So no children for that reason though he can greet children well. \n\nWe love this boy. He's ready to go home!",

However, once I get to know you I am a big goofball that loves long walks and playing tug of war. If you are my best friend, I'll even let you hear my goofy noises that sound like birds! I'm getting much better at making new dog friends, so my friends at the Humane Society think I could thrive in a house with another dog! I've also learned to sit and lie down! I have a pretty quirky personality, so interested adopters should plan to meet me several times before an adoption! I am hopeful that a patient family is right around the corner.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete an online application at https://form.jotform.com/201174641622144.",

            "description": "Scout is a loving, energetic, 5-yr. old girl who absolutely adores her humans. She was pregnant when she came to Furkids' shelter. All of her puppies were adopted, but Scout is still waiting patiently at the shelter for her perfect match - she is our longest term resident! Scout is a dog who loves a project, and she spends her time outside re-arranging the yards; she loves to move big sticks around and feels like she has accomplished something grand every day! She is looking for a home where she is the only animal so that she can be the center of attention. She also needs to go to a home where she will be actively worked with every day, as this girl really needs to feel like she is adding value. After finishing her work, however, she is available for lots of cuddles and lots of treats! Scout weighs 52 lbs. and her estimated birthdate is 3/14/2015. If you want to know more about Scout and to speak to an Adoption Counselor, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

London has a bit of a limp from an old fracture that healed incorrectly, but it doesn't bother her one bit! She is incredibly sweet, hates the rain, and loves to snuggle. She is a fairly large dog, but not too large for your lap (according to her)!! She would be best as the only animal in the home, but she is great with older kids. She is not reactive to other dogs, but wants to keep her snuggles all to herself. She is a low-energy dog that likes to run some zoomies and play for a while, but really just wants head scratches all day long.\n\n London is 5 years old (est. birth date 5/28/2015) and her adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about London, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Shaye is a youngster at 11, full of energy for a great ball game or long walk, a true lover of the great outdoors. He\u2019s full of personality, curiosity and confidence, fine meeting anyone and everyone. Belly rubs are his favorites! Stimulating Shaye\u2019s great brain is easy with food puzzles and trick training cause he\u2019s happy to learn and eager to do well! He is rather selective with dogs so best as a solo boy and not a dog park dog, plus he requires a fenced yard. Shaye is about 45 pounds and good with cats. He has allergies to certain food and grasses so is on daily medication to prevent flare-ups.\nPrior to GHF, he was in a MD shelter from someone who could not manage his needs well.\n\n",

Unfortunately, over the years he has learned to not trust people as easily as he once did.  It takes time to build that bond and we are hoping to find someone who is committed to continuing his training to make him feel safe and secure, while giving him a loving and structured environment he needs.   He has food/kennel aggression and he fear bites (no one has been severely injured by him). We are working with him on training to correct his behaviors. With time and patience we are hoping he will learn that not all people will be mean to him. He has specific triggers that we are working to either avoid or correct through the training. Sadly he is staying at our facility at this time so he is not getting one on one training with the same person. We are actively trying to get him into a foster home that can work with him. He is okay with some dogs and cats but not all. Due to his previous bite history he cannot go to a home with young children. If you are interested in more information on Tucker please email caawsmail@yahoo.com.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal please go here to find out how and fill out our app online: http://www.caaws.org/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Blue and his sister Lady lived on chains for 13 years!!!  Lady\u2019s health was deteriorating and an animal lover who lived nearby was able to convince the owners to surrender her so that she could get proper vet care and TLC in a home environment. The person sadly had to leave Blue behind and the poor guy was miserable.  Blue was crying and shaking after Lady had left . SNARR was asked to help Blue and we said yes. Blue had never been vetted, he was covered in fleas, a skin rash, Despite this rough life Blue has led, he\u2019s the sweetest boy!!!! He loves to snuggle and needs to have his paw on you :-) He\u2019s done remarkably well at adjusting to being inside, learning how to play, and he\u2019s like a curious puppy exploring new things for the first time. He needs a fenced yard for sure, he\u2019s never been off a chain.  For the first time yesterday he climbed on the couch! Now it\u2019s his favorite place to hang out. Blue doesnt mind you dressing him up and is a ham for the camera. He\u2019s great with kids but I think a older more calm atmosphere would be best for this old guy. Blue doesn\u2019t do well with kitties so a home without cats is necessary. He likes to chase them. \nCould you be the special family that gives Blue the life he always deserved ??? Apply today at www.snarrnortheast.org\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary",

The reas on was due to space - with COVID happening the shelters were closed and no adoptions. We saw him and just had to save him. He is great with other dogs and very sweet. He is a perfect size at 47 lbs..he is gorgeous and needs a loving, happy home so he can learn that the world is a good place and deserving of him! He is only about a year old but not really hyper. He needs a yard and not an apartment. He would probably be best with older children and not toddlers - he is shy but will warm up when he knows he is safe... Don't miss out on Cullen!",

            "description": "I'm Hans, a fun-sized Shepherd mix. I'm the perfect size, weighing about 40 lbs at 18 months old. My foster mom calls me her handsome little fox because of the markings on my face. I arrived from Texas about a month ago and although I'm shy with new people, I've found that learning new things helps me build that confidence I so need. My foster mom shows me lots of love and introduces me to new people all the time, so we are working on this.\n\nDo you have another dog I could play with? I LOVE dogs and LOVE to play! That is when I am the happiest, actually. Chasing other dogs around the yard is totally my favorite thing to do! So, we've agreed that I definitely need to go to a home with another dog as it helps me build confidence. I also must go to a home with a fully fenced yard. Since I'm not totally trusting humans at this time, I could easily get scared and run.\n\nCats??? No problem! My foster mom has 3 of them and I totally ignore them. I even ignore the one that terrorizes the other dogs. I know what she is up to, she can't fool me! I am too smart for that. Kids? I will do well with older kids that dont move so fast and are patient with me. I am also 100% potty-trained and use the doggie door whenever I need to go outside. I have never had an accident in the house either.\n\nThat's another thing about me, I'm really smart! I catch on quick to routines and where everyone is supposed to go. So, I would excel in an agility course training as I love games of all kinds. I am still pretty scared of car rides as that was never part of my life, but the more I do it, the better I will be at it. My foster mom walks me everyday and I walk fantastic on a leash and follow her lead.\n\nI use my crate as my little house I go to when Im scared, so please make sure you have a crate for me as I really enjoy that safe place to have.\nI'm not gonna lie, new people scare me. So, when you meet me, I am going to be super shy. However, once I learn that I can trust you, I will be your forever friend. Can you provide a loving home for me to grow old in? If so, please apply!!\n\nApply here: https://www.fetchfosterandrescue.com/adopt\n\nName: Hans\nSex: Male\nBreed: Shepherd mix\nAge: 1 year\nWeight: 40 lbs\nCurrent on vaccines: Yes\nAltered: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\nAdoption: 300 + GPS collar\nGood with Cats: Yes\nGood with Kids: Prefer older kids\nGood with other Dogs: Yes\n\n \n\n*Due to this dog's history, for their safety, they will be adopted with a GPS collar. The cost is $149, which includes the collar and a 1 year subscription of the gps tracking services.\n\n\n\n*Positive reinforcement obedience training is a great way to bond with your new family member.

            "description": "Like a lot of us, this sweet, fuzzy-bear of a dog finds the world to be a little bit too much at times. If you know anyone who has sensory processing issues, you might be able to relate to Fulton. He is sensitive to noises and can be overwhelmed by new environments, but can thrive in a stable home and really blossoms once he learns to trust people. He enjoys the company of other calm animals and has lived with dogs and cats. He has shown us how he bonds very closely to his friends, and is a silly, playful, and affectionate pup. Fulton seems to have excellent manners in the home - he's very good about not getting up on furniture without being invited, doesn't get into things he shouldn't and isn't destructive, and sleeps quietly through the night in his crate. He will entertain you with his adorable antics like prancing around the yard like a pony, then bouncing over and sitting in front of you with the biggest smile on his face. He's the perfect pooch for someone who has a fenced yard and isn't into long walks around the 'hood. He feels safest in the house and prefers his potty breaks and play time to be in the backyard with you close by. He loves toys and is perfectly content to amuse himself when you're doing other things but likes hanging on the sofa watching Netflix if you want some company. If you would love to have a smile, a friendly nudge and some goofy company when you get home, Fulton is your guy. Because of his sensory issues, he is prone to the occasional meltdown (give us a holler about him and we can show you what that looks like) when new things become too much but in the right home, he'll not only be happy and content but you'll be delighted to have such a goofy, loyal, trusting companion. Fulton is also thriving in APA!'s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Fulton has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Fulton is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' coming when called and 'Place', which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Fulton successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Fulton is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Fulton after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193. Fulton has already picked up a lot of basic obedience and is even working on some advanced training to help him learn to deal with situations he finds stressful. Fulton is a gentle soul who is ready to find a loving home. Come meet this special pup! Follow Fulton on Instagram @omg_its_fulton",

Learns quickly & aims to please. \n\nHe's nonreactive. Has played well with some dogs but can also be unpredictable with other animals so he is best as your sole companion. No dog parks! \n\nHe thrives with exercise, training & structure! He is great in a crate, knows the doggie door, great on a leash. LOVES to play & just an all around awesome dude. \n\nHis adoption fee is $200. This covers his neuter, vaccines & microchip! \n**Ozzy is living with a dog trainer. Anyone interested in adopting will have to meet with her- see what he's learned & be willing to continue with his training so they can continue to have an awesome well rounded dog that Ozzy now is! If you're not willing to commit to this-- move along! Ozzy will not be the dog for you!**\n\nYou can email his dog trainer at pawcreektraining@gmail.com.\n\nThanks!",

She wasn't in very good health when she arrived, but the shelter staff gave her lots of TLC and nursed her back to health, and she was a super mama to all her pups. All of Tiana's pups have been adopted and now it's her turn to find a forever home! She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and ready for the rest of her life to begin. She's in great health now and just needs a family to give her all the love she deserves. If you'd like to kick off 2021 with a special new family member, please apply for Tiana at WFAHS.orgThe first step in our adoption process is an application. Once that is received, we will contact you to make an appointment to meet the animal. \n\nAdoption Applications can be completed at www.WFAHS.org",

I was beaten and turned on my owner when i had enough an dhad bit him. So my owner took me to have me euthanzied it was then discovered how beaten and broken i was, that the shelter would only turn me over to a rescue for help. My story is still unfolding as although i am doing better in trusting, I need someone who understands what i have got through, understands that i have trust issues and the i was to belong and be loved. Where i am being housed at, i have had no issues and am being slowly coming around to trusting. I am not aggressive, am dog friendly, and with time, work and training i will be a loyal and faithful dog.",

Xander has lived with other male and female dogs, but will do best as an only dog or with another female. He will chase cats. Xander is housetrained and has a medium/low energy level. He loves to lounge around on the couch and will do best in a low-activity household and no children. He knows basic commands but needs to work on his leash skills. He is still a little nervous in the shelter and will take some time adapting to his new home. He is thin but is gaining weight. \nXander has been heartworm tested negative, altered, and is current on vaccinations. You will receive health records and a bag of Science Diet food upon adoption. Adoption donation $100. Must be a homeowner with bully experience. \nThe Clinton County Humane Society is a no-kill, nonprofit, volunteer-based organization. We do not receive county or government funding and depend on our adoption donations to fund the shelter. Please complete the pre-adoption questionnaire at clintoncohumanesociety.org.

I'm a little hesitant when I first meet you, only because it's just something that I just take time feeling comfortable with. Although, once I'm comfortable. Oh man am I so happy to be with you!! I do prefer to have my personal space when it comes to handling so that is why I recommend myself with a family with children no younger than 12. I do pull on leash but that's just because I'm SOO excited to get out and go for a run or walk, whichever you prefer, I'm just happy to be included. :) I love toys!! Squeaky toys, soft toys, tennis balls. Anything you can offer! I can play for hours upon hours! I also love treats; I would call myself treat motivated!! I'm a smart girl too... I know sit and shake with BOTH paws! How smart am I? I would call myself a couch dog too, just someone who can either go on a nice run at the park with OR someone you need to watch a good movie with, I can be there for you! On another topic, I am popular when it comes to meeting dogs here. In the beginning I was a little unsure, especially with approaching. I did relax with just co-existing with them though. Now, I do love to hangout with dogs on a shared fence-line. It's fun to meet new dogs all the time! But no cats!! I don't enjoy cats being in my presence, so I need a home without any cat companions! Overall, I think I do need an experienced home with leadership dedicated to training and exercise. Hope to meet you soon!",

Since she is a quieter girl and kind of shy, she often gets overlooked. This girl will never be romping through your home to launch herself onto the couch by your side - covering you with kisses. But hey, not everyone wants that kind of energy anyway!\n\nIf you are looking for a quieter girl, one who will chill by your side, listening to your troubles - well, Natasha is the girl for you. She warms up to strangers at her own speed and once she decides they are friendly, she marks them in the friend column.\n\nNatasha has good leash skills, has had some basic training and likes other dogs. She is a petite girl, perfect for a condo or townhome.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

He is crate trained and house broken and is working on basic commands like sit with food reinforcement. Dario loves to play with balls and tug a war toys and would love a family where he can get lots of exercise. He does well with older kids and with other dogs who like to play but does not get along with cats. Dario will need a strong leader in the family to teach him to walk on leash and accept strangers. He is protective of his family.\n\n",

Blessing is 3 years old and ready for a loving home of her own. While in the shelter Blessing did well in playgroup with other large dogs with similar energy. \nShe is sweet as she looks and walks fantastic on leash, she doesn't pull at all! I imagine her being a great gardening buddy because she loves to sniff all the flowers and can inspect your grass and dirt by having the time of her life rolling in it. She would make a great walking buddy too! She loves car rides and is treat motivated which will help with her training. She is a little dog focused so will need a family understanding of slow introductions and to take their time letting her decompress. She will need a home with NO small dogs or cats. She will need encouragement with basic commands, she has great energy and makes good eye contact which will help along the way. She is eager to learn! Blessing isn't a fan of a skateboarders passing by but doesn't mind bicycles at all. She is all smiles for people and loves to say hi. Ready for some Blessing in your life? Come by to meet her, she needs a foster or adopter to welcome her into a home life. She is house trained and crate trained. Has some basic obedience training and comes with free lessons.",

All my pups are raised and adopted and now it's time for me to find a furever home of my own. I am very sweet and good with other dogs. I do not have any food aggression. As long as you routinely give me a potty break, I will be very clean in the home. My leash manners need work, because I am a bit strong and will pull. I know a few basic commands such as sit and stay, but an obedience and training course would be ideal for us both and would ensure I become a good canine citizen. I get very anxious when it rains and storms and I was even so afraid that I jumped out of the window in my room once! Fortunately, the nice people here have figured out that they can give me medicine and I calm right down.",

I weigh about 80 pounds and I am ready to sniff-sniff-sniff and follow my nose on all kinds of adventures, WITH YOU! I thoroughly enjoy going for long walks. Want a hiking buddy? I'm in, I'm no couch potato! In fact, I do very well in doggie daycare and would thrive in an active home with or without other dogs. Sorry, no cats, they are just too much fun for this ol' hound boy to chase.\n\nI really LOVE being around people most of all and will lovingly follow you around. I love food, second-best to people! OK, maybe it's a tie! I am not food aggressive at all, but when I smell food - any kind of food - I get very excited and will do anything I can to get to the source of that wonderful smell! My foster mom crates me when she's cooking, for some reason she doesn't want my help! She also crates me when she's not at home, this stops me from helping myself to pantry - darn!\n\nSee, I am originally from Kentucky and was found as a stray. My foster mom surmises that I never lived in a home before and that I was an \"outside dog\" so all of the luxuries of a home environment were new to me when I arrived. I have been in my foster home since August though so I have learned so much! Yup, I'm ready for a forever family to take me the rest of the way! So whattya say?\n\nAre you ready for some forever fun, with me?! Great! Please fill out an application today at www.northstarpets.org and ask for *UNWANTED HOUND SEEKING A HOME!\n\n2/2/21 1:34 PM",

            "description": "The head of a hound dog, the body of a Jack Russell, the speckled coat of a Cattle Dog, and a heart of gold! Mix all that together and you get Nigel! Nigel is a 2 year old stumpy-legged, big-headed super mutt who came to CCR from a shelter in the Western suburbs where he had been found stray. Nigel was absolutely petrified in the shelter, refusing to move or even make eye contact. We believed he was someone's pet who had ended up in a scary situation, so we took him back to CCR to do some behavior rehab. Jump forward a couple of weeks, and Nigel is not the shy, scared dog he used to be! Quite the opposite - Nigel is an active, social, friendly, exuberant, busy dog who loves attention and being treated like a little baby. Nigel is a terrier through and through - despite being under 30 pounds, Nigel can jump almost 6 feet in the air when he's excited enough! He loves to play fetch and tug with toys, and he has the Cattle Dog habit of nibbling your ankles and elbows when he wants you to get a move on! Nigel is housetrained and used to going in his crate at night. He loves to be in the middle of the action and is the kind of dog who will want to be wherever you are, whenever you're there. Nigel does not like other dogs or cats, so a home with a private fenced-in yard would be ideal, or a neighborhood where he won't have to see a lot of dogs constantly. His mouthy play style is too much for children, but he's the perfect addition to a home that loves terriers and all their smarts and energy. If you are looking for a busy bee to keep you on your toes, then Nigel is the man for you!\n\nTo meet Nigel, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

Grant found himself in a animal shelter that specializes in Kittie Cats.  Even though he is not a Kitty, this Rescue helped him find Lone Star Shih Tzu and Lhasa Apso Rescue.  Grant is now healthy,  but has very limited vision. He uses his nose and other senses to get around, so a potential adopter should be aware of this and know that he likes to be near his human most of the time.\n\nGrant has been having so much fun in his foster\u2019s mommy\u2019s home and she has learned much about him. Grant is good with other dogs, but he does not appreciate the youngsters getting in his face. An easy-going dog companion would be ok to have in his new home if they also respect his space.  He is super good overnight in a crate. And if you\u2019re paying attention, you can tell when he needs to go potty.  \n\nGrant has said he dreams of a fenced backyard so he can roam and explore safely, but prefers someone staying outside with him because he is comforted to always have a human close. This is also true inside the home. He is happy to follow you from room to room and settle wherever you are. Even though Grant is considered blind, once he gets used to his new home he navigates very well. A home with very little to no stairs will be required. \n\nHis foster mommy says she will miss him very much since he is a nice doggy, even-tempered, and willing to please.\n\nWith just a few considerations Grant is just like any other dog. Please if you have it in your heart to add this sweetheart to your family, please let us know!",

He has spent nearly a year with us, and he is ready for a home to call his own! Conan originally came to us as a stray, so we don\u2019t know his history. What we do know that he is a super smart guy with energy for days! Conan spent most of the Covid quarantine with our trainer who had nothing but great things to say about him. He learns quickly and gets along with most other larger dogs. He would actually do well in agility. Conan is tired of the shelter life and hopes YOU can be his knight in shining armor.\nConan is looking for a home with experienced dog owners that will continue his training. No small kids for this fella.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nWesley is a happy, snuggly, chatty AM Staffie who is looking for the right home.  He bonds quickly and will faithfully stay by your side.  He loves going for   leisurely walks and car rides. Loves to snuggle while being a couch potato with you.  When you need a good laugh, you can count on Wes to cheer you up.  If he wants attention or simply disagrees with what you're doing he will let you know in Wesley speak which is basically a mix of whining and screaming like an 80s rock singer but definitely not as loud.  He really is the perfect sidekick. \n\nBefore you think you might be the perfect home for Wesley please understand he has some specific needs:  \n\nThese include:\n- Wesley came to our rescue heartworm positive and went through treatment with our foster.  This means Wesley will need to be on heartworm preventive, given monthly from the vet, for the rest of his life.  The cost is about $10 a month.\n\n- Wesley is not comfortable around young children and will growl and snap at them.  He needs a home with no children below the age of 14 yrs of age.  \n\n- He requires slow introductions to dogs and may require up to a 2 week shut down period after adoption to feel comfortable in his new home.  This mostly applies to high energy dogs.  He does much better with older, chiller dogs.\n\n- Wesley also has skin allergies.  He requires some medication and special shampoo, otherwise is prone to skin infections.  \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks) \n\nFoster to contact: Ben & Tracy - tschlax@gmail.com or 612-750-7411\n\n Our fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment are likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

In December, she was diagnosed with Masticatory Muscle Myositis. She is being treated with medication and doing well. She will continue to be cared for under our Angel Pet program even after adoption until the issue has fully resolved. Sweet Pea loves to be outside, walks nicely on a leash, rides great in the car and absolutely loves going in the water! Any puddle, lake or stream will do! She has some food guarding issues so she needs an adult-only home with an experienced adopter. She likes other dogs and might be fine in a home with another dog if they can be separated at mealtimes and sharing of toys is managed while she settles into her new home. Sweet Pea is spayed, micro-chipped and up to date on vaccines. Her adoption fee is $350. If you would like to be Sweet Pea's new BFF, please email dogs@daws.org to arrange a meeting.",

Vamp says he would love to find his own fur-ever home!\n\nAdoption fee for Dogs is $100, which includes microchip. All of our dogs and puppies have been examined by a veterinarian, de-wormed,  vaccinated, treated for fleas and ticks, spayed or neutered and  tested for heartworms (If 6 months of age and over) and are on monthly heartworm preventative.  Puppies too young to be spayed/neutered require a refundable $50 deposit which will be returned upon proof of spay/neuter. If this is done at our vet (Allen's in Parsons), there is no charge for the spay/neuter. Give us a call at 620-421-0445 or e-mail us at pals@wavewls.com today to find out more about this pet.",

            "description": "Do you have an active lifestyle? Do you love being outdoors for hours a day? Have you always wanted a dog that could learn lots of tricks and would do well with a job to do?\nKipper may be the dog for you!\n\nKipper is a HIGH HIGH energy boy who wants to play, play, play! He is a bit of a class clown that will provide endless entertainment. He would appreciate a yard with a TALL fence to show off his athleticism of leaping in the air and throwing toys for himself. (He can put his nose over the head of a 6ft tall person, it's impressive!)\n\nKipper would likely do best in a house rather than an apartment as he is not just big in personality, he is also just BIG! He is a 70 lb big clumsy boy who needs lots of space to stretch out.\n\nHe doesn't know what to think of kids and would likely knock them down with his enthusiasm.\n\nFamily visit: Required\nDog to dog: Required\nChild integration score: moderate\n\nAttn: During COVID-19 all adoptions are by appointment only. To make an appointment, view available animals on our website and either contact the foster parent directly (if in foster) or submit an adoption questionnaire to adoptmcasac@montgomerycountymd.gov\n\nWebsite: montgomerycountyMD.gov/animalservices\n\n_______________\n\nPLEASE CHECK OUR WEBSITE FOR INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 CLOSURE, AND CHECK BACK OFTEN FOR UPDATES.\n\n_______________\n\n***** PLEASE NOTE:  Our adoption process can move quite quickly, and applications are considered on a first-come, first-served basis.  \n\nSome animals, especially puppies/kittens and small dogs, can go very quickly.  For this reason, we recommend that if you see an animal you are interested in, submit an adoption questionnaire *as soon as possible*.  \n\nPlease do not bring your current pets to the shelter.  If you intend to adopt a dog and want the new dog and your current dog to meet, that can be scheduled with the help of your Adoption Counselor.  Thank you! *****\n",

She knows most of her basic commands, although her down is a bit unconventional, as she will stretch her back legs outs out, and look more like a frog than a dog. Smushie will need to be an only dog, but do not worry this is how she prefers to live. All attention will be hers. She is housebroken and will have no problem adjusting to a new home. If love is what you want, Smushie is what you need.\n\nOPERATION SMUSHIE IS UNDERWAY!\nSmushie came to ARF over five years ago, and sadly, she remains one of our longest residents at the Adoption Center. As a friend of ARF, you have probably met or heard of Smushie. With more than 2,000 days at the shelter, she continues to be overlooked making ARF more determined than ever to find her a home in 2020! We have made this our mission for these final weeks of 2020, calling it Operation Smushie, and we need your help! \n\nWhether it is her size, or her breed, or the fact that she needs to be the only pet in the home, Smushie continues to be passed over by potential adopters. We will not stop until Smushie has a home. \n\nPlease help us spread the word about this beautiful girl, and together we can give her the life she has been patiently waiting for!",

I have a bit of energy and love playing with toys but I will settle down after a bit.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to join Animal Rescue Corp and The Bissell Pet Foundation (along with many other great rescue organizations) to save these sweet dogs! This is a wonderful video put together by ARC that encompasses all the heartbreak and hope of this rescue.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Buster and I am a 5-year-old Labrador Retriever mix with a heart as golden as my shiny coat. I am desperately searching for my next best friend and hope it's YOU. I was adopted as a young pup and really looked forward to meeting new people, going places, and interacting with other dogs. Unfortunately, my people just didn't give me the time and patience I needed to explore the world. Rather, they threw me quickly into unfamiliar situations that made me anxious and nervous. When I indicated that I was scared, they gave up on me and isolated me from the experiences I desperately needed. So here I am, 4 years old, and learning manners and socialization skills like those little puppies do. The good news is, I'm nailing it and am an excellent student! I am very quick to pick up on basic obedience and have already mastered several tricks. While I love to meet new people, I need a slow introduction to ensure I find them to be trustworthy and kind. Positive experiences and controlled repetition are boosting my confidence tremendously. I will thrive in a predictable, structured environment with adopters who understand my need for a little extra time. \n\nI am desperate to please my favorite humans and have really improved my leash skills. I really enjoy my walks now that I am engaged with the person at the other end of the leash. I am very treat motivated and also enjoy words of affirmation. Seriously, \"Good Boy!\" is like music to my ears! All I ask is that you take the time to show me what you expect and then hold me to those expectations. I crave structure and leadership and respond very well to both. I would love for my new person to engage in training with me to continue what Ive been learning and the rescue said theyll introduce whoever adopts me to the trainer who has worked with me. Please take a chance on me, I promise you a lifetime of loyalty and friendship. \n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration",

All I know is that I love being around all those 2-legged creatures with the leashes and the food. They are so snuggly! And delicious, tooI really like giving them kisses.\n\n \n\nI dont mind being in a crate. Its even kind of my happy place. The ones with the leashes and the food tell me that Im bombproof. I dont know what that means, but I do know that I can handle anything that might stress a lot of other dogs out. Pretty sure thats because I spent a lot of time on the tough streets of Houston growing up. Those 2-leggeds werent always so nice to me down there, but that doesnt even matter anymore because I love EVERYONE I meet.\n\n \n\nThe folks with the leashes say that I could use a little more practice at the other end of the leash. They tell me Im getting better at it all the time, and we just keep walking and walking and walking. I hope someday I can go walking with YOU too! Oh, and get thiswe tried walking on this thing called a treadmill recently. Its where you just walk in the same place without going anywhere. At first I thought it was a little silly, but I started to get the hang of it before too long and want to try it some more. Do you have one of those things in your home, because I would love some more practice?\n\n \n\nHere are some of my favorite things: belly rubs, naps, and laps! Wait, there is also this stuff called snow that is waaaaay fun to roll around in. We sure didnt have that where I came from! I love it so much here, and those 2-leggeds say that my tail NEVER stops wagging. Im just a happy girlwhat can I say? \n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Cotton\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 10 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 70 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: No\n\nGood with cats?: Yes\n\nGood with kids?: Don't know yet\n\nAny medical issues?: Cotton was recently diagnosed with mammary tumors, which is common in dogs that are not spayed.\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n10/22/20: Hi there, it's Cotton! Just want to share a quick update on how things are going here in Wilmington.\n\nI've started my slow kill heartworm treatment, and I've added a third member to my pack- she's a raccoon but I love her like a pup! Taking naps with my pack is one of my favorite things to do.\n\nOver the past few weeks, it felt right to let my FM get to know me better- I've shown her a few tricks that I know including sit, lay down, and shake.\n\nI've still never had an accident in the house or caused any damage. When it's time to go out, I let my FM know, and if I feel like delicately chewing on something, it's always on a member of my pack.\n\nEven though I'm in the double-digits, I'm strong for my age. I really enjoy walks in our neighborhood, so I'm going to practice walking with a harness over the next few weeks. Keep your paws crossed for me!\n\nTTYL!\n\n8/31/20: Cotton arrived at her foster home gently carrying her stuffed animal baby by the scruff of its neck. Although she seemed timid, it didn't take her long to warm up to her new foster mom. A husky and newly added rottweiler make up her pack of stuffed animal babies, and her favorite thing to do is cuddle next to her human and her babies. Cotton is gentle with all things, and throughout all her travels, she has not injured her stuffed animals and treats them like her pups.\n\nLikely kept outside on a leash in her former life, she prefers brief trips outside these days and she politely lets you know when it's time for quick trip. She is house trained as we have not had a single accident since we've had her. She is also crate trained, and she will sleep through the night in her crate with no issues. She is Heart worm Positive and is being treated.\n\nAlthough this senior lady is quiet and gentle with everything around her, she seems leery of other dogs, and would be okay if it were just her and her forever human.\n\n_________\n\n8/14/20: Welcome Cottonella to CBR. More to come as she gets settled into her foster home.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

He wandered up and we worked for a couple of days for him to come inside and join the dog party.  Being a bit of a mystery, we decided Bond, James Bond was a fitting name for him.\n\nHe likes other dogs, but is a little hesitant with new people at the moment and does need someone with a little patience with him. He's curious and you can tell he wants to love you- he just hasn\u2019t been treated well by people in the past.  He needs a foster to help him transition to the next phase of his new awesome life. He deserves  to couch to nap on too.\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home.

He's been learning lots of new skills and he's a pro at answering to sit, down, come and shake. And, boy, does he love obeying 'come' if that means he's rewarded with treats. Once Axel has made new human friends, he wants to romp with them and back his booty into their laps for scratches. And with paws on their arms, he'll remind them that he wants those tasty treats. He promises to even learn more about his leash walking skills. Plus he's already house- and crate-trained. Axel hopes for a human friend to accompany on this journey through life. He'll prefer grownups in a home where he can be the only pet. Follow his antics on Instagram at Instagram.com/you_need_a_new_axel. Come offer him a diploma and he'll follow you home!",

She's made incredible progress in trusting humans and is a sweet, gentle, independent soul. She loves other dogs and finds comfort in having a four-legged friend (big or small!) she can hang out with. She's a low maintenance gal who is just as happy to go on an adventure hike as she is to curl up in her bed at home. Linda has come a long way in her journey to becoming an affectionate, playful pup (bones and plushy toys really bring it out of her!). She's a sweet gal that's continuing to come out of her shell. Linda will need her anal glands expressed regularly throughout her life, and her future adopters should be prepared to commit to her with this medical requirement.

            "description": "This sweet boy was surrendered to us when his owner passed away. The owner\u2019s son who is homeless and knew he couldn\u2019t give him the quality of life he so deserves, cared enough about him to make sure he got into our rescue where he would be cared for and assisted in finding his new forever home. \n\nAs far as personalities go, this boy is a gem. He gets along well with people, dogs and doesn\u2019t even have a problem if there\u2019s a proven dog-friendly cat around. He loves his belly rubs and attention but is also independent and doesn\u2019t mind being on his own for periods of time. He is a good passenger in the car and has a favourite green toy he takes outside every time he goes out. \n\nAt 8 years old Pinceau has some aches, pains and medical conditions that often accompany a senior dog. He does have arthritis in his hips so he\u2019s not a runner or a hiker. He really likes his walks but is not high energy. He has been receiving some injections and oral medications that have been making him feel better. He will need to continue with the prescribed course so he can enjoy his life as pain free as possible. He has also been experiencing some urinary dribbles and we are in the midst of starting him on a medication to see if that will improve. For now he is sporting some doggy diapers and looking oh so adorable! \n\nPinceau is also on a special gastro diet as he experienced some tummy upset from some of the non-prescription foods. \n\nTo make sure he is kept as healthy as possible he will need annual bloodwork, annual urine testing, monthly injections for his hips and a few oral medications. The monthly costs for all of the above, including his prescription food is approximately $275.00. \n\nSenior dogs make wonderful companions and are forever grateful. If you have a calm environment, no stairs (or very few stairs), don\u2019t mind administering some medication and getting some love and wet kisses in return, this boy may be for you!",

We can not recommend children or other dogs due to her not being able to control her energy. She was raised with other dogs and cats and most of the time she's fine with them but one dog she got into with and she wouldn't stop when told and had to hold her back for some time before she would settle down. Can you help her?\nhttps://www.causendogrescue.org/adoption-application.html\n\nIf you rent or own a home, we prefer you to have a fenced in yard.\nApartment living is also ok but prefer a fenced in area if open to the road.\nAll adults in the home will need to know they are getting a dog and will need to sign the adoption agreement.\nWe will not adopt to college students with multiple roommates.\nMilitary will need to provide a backup plan.\nWe require all pets in the home to be spay and neutered. Because to many dogs are being killed, due to there not being enough homes per dog in need. Only the lucky ones end up here.",

            "description": "Meet Indigo! \n\nMr. Indi was an owner surrender & came to Take Paws only a week(ish) ago! \nHe is about 4 yrs old. UTD on shots, HW negative & neutered. \n\nHe may seem all large and in charge, but, this dude will win you over with his nugget size & potato-like body. \n\nLike any potato, he takes his time warming up to new people, but once he does, he is hooked and awaits your snuggles and attention. His affection cannot be bought with treats ( although I'm sure it wouldn't hurt) but he'd rather know that he is safe, loved and can hang out with you while you work or play. \n\nHe is great with other dogs, lived with cats, and ok with kids. He is not a jumpy fella. If you're looking to add an additional member to your family, Indigo is waiting! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Her personality is a super plus and she loves everyone she meets, however we will not be placing her in a home with small children for the same reason.

Looking for his new forever family he\u2019s a happy boy and constantly a wiggle butt?! \n\nBickmans ideal home? Is an active family with older children and a large fenced yard as he loves to run and also needs to exercise to help get him back down to his ideal weight?. He also would need to be the only dog in the household as two years ago he was attacked by another dog and has become fearful aggressive towards other dogs.  He has been with a trainer last year to work through these issues and he can now walk by other dogs and ignore them and even greet them properly through fences and gates. He also went through training to become a diabetic alert dog for his previous owner who unfortunately has been permanently hospitalized from her terrible disease?. \n\nHis perfect family will get to do a lesson with his trainer. Bickman also ignores the cat Brody at his vets office but it\u2019s unsure how he would do living with one so best a home without any. Bickman loves his people and really all people.\n\nBickman will absolutely not be able to live In An apartment he needs exercise and lots of play and adventures!! He is being fostered in Auburn GA\n\nIf you think Bickman is the right fit for your family, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

My adoption fee of $200 includes my neuter surgery, deworming, microchip, and up-to-date vaccinations. \n\nI am a recent tripod due to an accident before my time at PLL and I am working on my social skills. I'll be a good boy but I need a bit to warm up to my new family! Because of how shy I am, I'd prefer to be in a home without any small children. \n\nI am currently in a foster home, which means I am not on site at Pawmetto Lifeline and am staying with someone volunteering their time and their home. If you'd like to meet, please mention it in your application so we can set up an appointment for me to be brought to the facility.\n\nMy adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a good fit. I appreciate your patience as the Adoption team discusses your application with my case managers!\n\nI've even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? If you'd like to meet me, please fill out an online application and an advocate will be with you shortly.",

            "description": "Babs is a sweet tempered perfect size dog who loves to have her tummy rubbed. She is very easy going almost all of the time, but will go after wildlife that is invading her (your) yard. She mostly loves hanging out with you on comfy cushions. She has a sensitive nose which seems to be her main way of seeing the world. On walks she will sniff anything interesting which is everything. She has a hypothyroid condition which is controlled with a twice daily pill which I usually give her in a small amount of peanut butter before her regular meal. Because of her condition, she is a little overweight right now. She will eat almost anything in your yard so I keep a close eye on her when she is out. She likes to bark at the dog next door and the feeling is mutual, but she will stop when told to. She is playful and likes chasing balls and playing tug of war. She is a great companion!She is great with humans - sweet, gentle, obedient, easily trusting. She only barks when someone approaches the door (and has even stopped doing that when it's someone she knows). We are working on sit, down and stay commands with some success! She is very food motivated.She loves belly rubs and even sits in my lap about once a day though she enjoys her space as well and doesn't need constant attention. Her ideal home and human:-No other dogs. No matter the size or how frequently she is introduced to the same one, she will consistently be quiet as they approach her and then snap at/snarl when they get too close. She is also highly distracted by dogs and the smell of dogs at the park so she braces and refuses to walk there.-She loves a daily small amount of playing fetch or tug-of-war with her human. This is her primary exercise as she hasn't been a fan of being outside or walking for very long.-She is completely house trained. Even when she was having diarrhea every day for weeks - she would hold it til she was outside. -I tried crating her, but she panted the whole time so I didn't try it for very long. During my 5-7 hour work shift she had free reign of my small home with no issues for the past two months. I didn't invite her to sleep in my bed, but she usually chooses to be in the same room as me when I am home.-She is 8-10 years old and rests a lot. Occasionally has bouts of energy where she is running and jumping and still has an intense hunting instinct when she smells rabbits in the yard.-She was a stray and tends to try to eat whatever she can find outside and has a sensitive stomach so she should be supervised outside.-Now that we've identified some of her health solutions, she is a pretty easy dog!Meds:-She has hypothyroidism, which should account for some of the exercise intolerance, extra weight and the fur loss that she has been experiencing. She takes one medication (Soloxine) twice a day for this and will need to take it daily Perhaps Babs doesnt look any thinner but she perks up when we are headed outside. Absolutely LOVES walks. Her downward dog was horrid on May 6, but before May 31st her butt couldnt get any higher and boy can she stretch! This is a very happy dog with lots of playfullness in her.",

            "description": "Lady is a loving senior girl with a heartbreaking story. She was left in an apartment to fend for herself for over a month after her owner was taken to the hospital - her owner thought her adult child was taking care of her but he wasn't! When the neighbors finally realized no one was entering the apartment they had the door unlocked only to find Lady wilting away...all the water from the toilet bowl was gone ( she had drank it) and a bag of dog food was empty ( her only food source)...and to make matters more distressing, poor Lady, who is vision impaired and 13 years young, was covered in urine and feces and matted beyond recognition. We will not post pictures of when she was found. THAT IS THE PAST! We will post pictures of our beautiful Lady as she is NOW our promise to her is a loving and caring forever home. Her owner never lived to know the hardship her poor baby suffered but we are sure she is looking down from heaven and seeing the care she is receiving now. Lady is a sweet and delightful well behaved girl...she gets along well with other dogs but NO KIDS. If interested i giving this special girl the loving home she rightfully deserves please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org ADOPTION FEE: $175.00\n",

She always wants to be in your lap. She's very curious but can also be cautious about new things. With her human's encouragement, she'll try just about anything. She's also very food motivated which is always a positive for training. Michelle prefers and loves dogs larger than her! Especially boys\n\nMichelle had a very hard past but now she knows that her life is good! She is crate trained and has done so well with her potty training. We feel Michelle would do best in a home with children over 10 and a (physical) fully fenced in yard. She has come so far and learned how to be such a good dog with her wonderful trainers.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Michelle and you live in the Buffalo, NY area please go to hamburgmutts.org and submit an application!Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

He knows some basic commands, like sit and stay. He took a day trip to a volunteer's house and did great! He was unsure when he first went into the house (we don't think he has lived in one), but then he opened up and thoroughly enjoyed himself. He found the toy box. That was like Christmas to Tyson! What a blast! Tyson is also part of our Pets in Progress Program where special needs pets get extra assistance from staff and volunteers.

            "description": "Good with dogs: Yes\nGood with cats: Unknown\nGood with kids: Yes, older children\nCrate trained: Working on it\nHouse trained: Yes\n\nSpecial Adoption Opportunity! ---\n\nKylie is a playful, sweet lady who loves to lay by her human's side, play in the yard, and be with her foster siblings. Kylie has been up north since January, and she is a totally different dog these days. She is timid and anxious around new people and in new situations, but give her time and share some cheese and she'll warm up to you- and others- in no time. She is very gentle, house trained, listens great and does well with routine! She gets along great with other dogs- they play, share toys, and Kylie follows them around a lot. Kylie loves being around her house mates so much, so she is still working a bit on her separation anxiety in the crate. She can be left for several hours at a time but may bark. She will need continued training to settle in the crate, even when her humans are around, and will likely be a better fit for a home where she wont bother neighbors. She likes walks but is still getting used to being on a leash in noisy areas. Having a yard would be pretty ideal! Kylie has so much love to give, and with just a little patience she will be sure to shower you with it. She cant wait to meet her FURever family.\n\n---Kylie is currently undergoing Heartworm treatment and while she has finished the bulk of it, she does have some minor medical care to complete. She is available for a medical foster who will eventually adopt her once she is medically cleared. All medical costs during this treatment are covered by LHK9. Any potential adopter would need to be available to take her to Heal Veterinary Clinic in Watertown for monthly blood tests until she is all clear. Please email Adoptions@lasthopek9.org if you are interested!\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.",

            "description": "Meet the beautiful dog who made us work for her trust, Mama Meadow. This beauty is around 5 years old, 45lbs, and a mom to 11 adorable puppies. This wonderful girl has one sad story to tell. Meadow was a stray who found herself on some pretty awesome peps property around July 27th. They tried to catch her but she was not having anything to with this. They begun feeding her to earn her trust. Meadow did not make this process easy at all. However, with presistence and patience their hard work paid off. On 8/18 during the thunder storm we had the couple trying to help Meadow was able to capture her in their horse trailer. At this point Meadow was VERY pregnant and we wanted to help her and her soon to be kiddos. Meadow was very fearful upon arrival and sadly this made it hard to find a foster home. That didnt stop us from giving Meadow the best set up here on site! Shortly after arrival,\n labor day to be exact, Mama Meadow blessed us with 11 adorable puppies. All of Meadows puppies have found their forever homes now its Meadow turn. We are still learning about Meadow but she continues to come more and more out of her shell daily. Do you have room in your heart for Mama Meadow? Can you show her just all the good life has to give and show her just how wonderful love is? If so please send us an application so we can make it happen! You may apply at mendohumanesociety.com \n\n\n\nTRANSFORMATION IN PROGRESS:\nLast night (8/17/20) our phones blew up with tags, messages and calls to help this sweet mama dog. The story was that a nice family had spotted this scared dog on their property 3 weeks ago and have been diligently working to gain her trust. They were not able to get close but a feeding routine kept her hanging around and soon they noticed that she was very pregnant. Yesterday evening with the loud thunder and crazy weather they were able to get her contained in this horse trailer. And this morning our team answered the call for help and got her to safety. This very scared girl was found way up Deerwood Drive in Ukiah, if you know where she belongs please give us a call! For now she is resting comfortably in our maternity suite and we will be working on gaining her trust. Rescue missions like this are made possible because of our team and the support we receive from our community! Getting her to safety was step one but the journey is not over yet. We run entirely on the donations from our community and now we need to get this whole family vetted and healthy. Will you help us by donating to their care? Donate below and please share!\n\nIf you are looking to donate supplies we need large crates and good quality puppy kibble and canned food.\n\nStay tuned for updates on our new friend. Big thank you to her finders for all their work caring for her over the last few weeks. We are so glad we get to help this little family through this difficult time.\n\nPlease spay and neuter your pets \n\n\nFor more info call us at 707 485 0123 or email dogteam@hsimc.org",

Her family could not afford vet care and the wound was infected by the time we got her.  She had to have surgery to clean everything out and she's doing great.  She is other wise healthy and even heart worm free.  Emma is not a pure doberman.  Photos are really deceiving regarding size.  Emma is pint sized weighing about 35 pounds.  She will never reach the size of a pure doberman - even the small ones that we often get.  But Emma is a perfect puppy.  She does not chew, is house trained and gets along with all dogs and people.  Emma is good with older children. If you would love to have a puppy minus all the puppy behavior, Emma might be your girl.  Go ahead and get your app in on this sweet girl!",

He is a very happy, friendly guy with the cutest ears you've ever seen! He was a stray that turned up down the street from the shelter. So he decided to walk himself over, turn himself in and find out about these forever homes everyone keeps talking about! Mac is in urgent need of a home with the family he deserves! Mac is good with other friendly dogs and can be tested with cats upon request. \n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. Heartworm test (including first 30 days of prevention) can be added for an additional $20.\n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today!",

I am a sweet friendly girl who loves everyone.  I am super affectionate and love pets.   I also think I am a lap dog and love to snuggle as close as I can to you.  I am very smart and quick to learn with a willingness to please.   I am an energetic girl, but I also love to relax with my people.   I would love to go adventuring and try some camping.  Bring on the smores!  I do well with small dogs but have never been tested with big ones.  My foster mom has \u201clittles\u201d.  I am just a happy, go lucky kind of girl. I have never been cat tested so my people are going to say no to a home with furry felines.  I was found wandering around a neighborhood.  You guessed it\u2026no owners in sight.  I am house trained, crate trained and leash trained. \n    \nI am spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccines.  \n",

She suffered from a painful condition known as entropian, where her eyelids curled inwards making each blink of her eyes miserable. She had a large hernia as a result of years of repeated pregnancys and C-sections. She also had to have a dental, to remove a couple of infected teeth. Now recovered and doing well, she is looking for a furrever home to spend her golden years. She gets very bonded to her person and will cry when she can  not be near them, so no apartments/attached dwelling type homes. She will need a Bulldog experienced home with no other pets.

ADR is not responsible for the health, temperament, behavior or placement of this dog. Listings are done at the request of the dog's owner and as an outreach and community service in hopes of finding these dogs a loving, stable forever home. Placement decisions are made solely at the discretion of the owner and not Austin Dog Rescue. Owners are required to ask for an adoption fee from adopters.\n\nThis is the information that we received from Malo's current family:\n\nThis is our boy Malo, and as it breaks my heart to do this - we are having to rehome him. Malo is a year and a half (almost two) Pitbull Terrier puppy who we adopted from the shelter at the beginning of this year. He's neutered, up-to-date on all of his shots and is currently on flea and tick medication. He truly is an amazing dog, but not the right fit for a family with young kids. He has a lot of energy, and is very much still a puppy. He needs a family that can respect his boundaries, but also give him the love, affection, training he needs and the time to run his energy out. We are rehoming him because we have two young kids, and from what we\u2019ve seen, he is not a fan of all the loud noise and chaos and kids intruding in his space. We suggest he is the only pet as he isn\u2019t fond of cats (we\u2019ve never seen him interact with any, but every time he sees them through our window, he immediately starts barking, and wanting to chase them) and we\u2019ve tried introducing him to one dog, and neither dog was having it - by that, I mean it didn\u2019t seem like a good fit ,so we separated before anything physical could go on. Although the paperwork we have from the shelter said he did good with his kennel mate and a few other dogs, so maybe we just went about the introduction wrong. As far as behavior goes, he is very high-strung, and has a ton of energy. He knows basic commands such as \"sit,\" \"stay,\" \"shake,\" \"drop it\"(he loves chewing on toys) and \"kennel up.\" He is very vocal, and will let you know when he has to go potty by barking until you let him out (he\u2019s also potty trained lol) he does have a tendency to get mouthy, and by that I mean like when a puppy is playing, and they use their teeth. I feel like he was possibly never trained out of that behavior. He has never bit anyone in a forceful or aggressive manner - we have been working on training him out of that.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this gorgeous guy, please contact Katie at: katieajones97@gmail.com\n\nNote: A small re-homing fee will apply to ensure a good home.",

            "description": "Pork Chop is what some may call a food connoisseur. He can't resist his fine whines and cheeses so much so that we chose the perfect food name to match his personality scrumptiously. This 60-pound chunky boy is crispy around the edges but holds many layers like grandma's lasagna. Pork Chop's tangy personality makes him a one pup chef but will keep you energized nonetheless. Among this fiery 2-year old's many layers is a chilled boy looking for a snacking gourmand just like him. Don't miss your opportunity to snuggle up with this hunky foodie and enjoy your favorite foods together! Pork Chop came to us on 8/8/20. We are unsure how he does with children. He must go to a home with no other pets! **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. You can include multiple animals you are interested in on one application. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

This super-sweet and mushy lady just walks up to a crowd of people, wagging her tail and smiling as if she knows everyone and expects everyone to pet her immediately (they usually do!).  Queen is about 5 1/2 years old and this girl is pure goofiness, sweetness, and despite having led a tough life by the looks of her, absolutely LOVES everyone she meets!  She's about 5 1/2 years old and she was surrendered by her owner with no reason given.  She seems fine with most dogs though she needs a cat-free home, she's extremely well-behaved, she's playful and fun, and there's nothing you won't love about Queen!  Come meet her!  File#29721  7/8/20\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Queen.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required.

            "description": "**PLEASE NOTE - CHA CHA NEEDS A QUIET, EXPERIENCED HOME WITH ANOTHER DOG AND A FENCED-IN YARD**\n\nCha Cha is a 1 year old spayed female lab/beagle mix who weighs 31 lbs. Cha Cha was rescued from an overcrowded shelter after being seized from a horrible hoarding situation with a few friends who have since found their forever homes. The conditions she was forced to live in were absolutely deplorable, and she can be quite nervous in new situations as a result. It's clear that she hasn't had many positive interactions with humans before she was saved, so she is looking for a patient, loving family that will teach her that the world and the people in it aren't so scary after all. She needs a quiet home without children and a family with dog experience. Cha Cha absolutely loves being around other dogs and seems to gain confidence from her canine pals, so we are requiring that her forever home have another dog or two that can help show her the ropes. She is still learning how to walk on a leash, so her forever home must have a securely fenced-in yard that she can practice her leash walking skills in. We have already seen such an amazing transformation in Cha Cha in her foster home and can't wait to watch her continue to transform. When she sees her foster mom, her whole body wiggles in excitement! Cha Cha endured unimaginable neglect in her past, but we have promised her only good things from here on out. Watching a shy dog transform with love, patience, and time is an incredibly rewarding experience, and we cannot wait to watch Cha Cha blossom as she continues to learn how great a dog's life can be. Please help us find Cha Cha the loving, patient forever family she so desperately deserves! \n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Piper is very easy on introduction. She isn't in your face about meeting you, but she is just so sweet once you decide to approach her. If you reach out to make friends, she will decide to be your BFF immediately. \nI think she would benefit with more leash walking, but she was NO trouble. She is also quite small so it is very easy to manage any tugging. Honestly, I was prepared for a much longer walk, but she wore out and flopped down panting after a block!. I took her back to my house and decided to just chill with her for a few hours outside. I found out this little lady is just a love bug. She wants to stare into your eyes in bliss as you give her belly rubs. This girl was gentle, loving, and showed me signs of extreme intelligence. I think she would be easy to train if we could figure out what she would \"\"work\"\" for. (She doesn't respond to balls as prizes!) \nShe saw many neighborhood dogs on our walk, and was super happy (play stance!) when she saw small dogs. All of the larger dogs in the 'hood were having some fence aggression, and her reaction to these was to have hackles. I'm not sure how she would respond to a larger friendly dog, but I do think testing her with friendly smaller dogs would be the way to start. I wouldn't doubt that she is 100% friendly with all other FRIENDLY dogs. Honestly, I think she would do well placed in a home with anyone that doesn't have small small kids. Even a nonactive home would probably be fine for her. She might need some puzzles and chew toys to keep her brain stimulated, but she wasn't super energetic! She really just wants to snuggle!",

She is dog selective and would need to have a very slow introduction to another dog and would love to be an only child. (NO cats for this girl - she's not a fan at all). \n\n\n\nAnita is housebroken and loves to snuggle on the couch with her human and get hugs. Are you looking for a snuggle bug to spend time with?

I got my name because, like Mariah, Whitney and Celione, I like to be the center of attention and the queen of the castle.  Me and my siblings were found in a field in a rural part of Utah when we were just 6 weeks old and taken to the  animal shelter.  It was pretty scary in the shelter; but then we were rescued by Herding Haven and now we live in a wonderful foster home. My foster mom and dad are nice; but, people still make me a little nervous.  I am very shy when I first meet new people, but, with patience (and yummy treats) I gradually warm up.   I LOVE other dogs, especially big, playful ones.  I would really like a home with another dog to help me with my social skills and would prefer not to live with little/young kids (they scare me).   Big kids are ok.  I am super smart and did I mention my ears are HUGE?!?! I am crate-trained, almost fully potty trained and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If your are interested in completing and application for me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

            "description": "When puppy Gus was 6 weeks old some evil person threw 2 different chemicals on his face.  When he came into rescue it was not know if he would make it or not. But with lots of extra care and love he pulled through.   His mouth and eyes were closed shut due to the chemicals and he had so many blisters in his mouth that we had to pur\u00e9e food for him and syringe feed him for 6 weeks.  Because of the chemicals he is partially blind. He doesn\u2019t see too well in the dark and hesitates walking in a strange place or if furniture is moved around in a different place. He loves anyone he meets, never meets a stranger.  He likes toys and treats. And massages.  Boy does he love massages.  And belly rubs.  He is very strong and is about 75 To 80lbs. So he would be best with kids over 10-12 yrs because of his size   His tail is very strong when he wags it  He will sit or lay down when asked. He kennels very well. Puppy Gus does not like to go outside by himself he wants someone to be with him when he goes out.  He is not a big barker Either. He would love to be someone\u2019s baby with lots of love and attention.  Such a sweetheart.  You can see all the scars still on his face and under his chin and neck. His eyes have a purplish color in them because of the evilness done to him. His adopt fee is 95.00. Call Trish at 901-482-9921 for more info on sweet puppy Gus.  He is in the Provo/salt lake city area as our rescue organization has moved here to utah.",

He is still timid of strangers but Vanwaldberg Kennels in Snohomish is willing to work with perspective people.\n\nHe is such a huge loving teddy bear that loves walks, squeaky toys, sunroofs on a car ride and acreage to run. \n\nHe is looking for an active outdoorsy person perhaps a bachelor? \n\nAre you a person who can be dedicated in his training and open your heart and home to him?\n*NO DOGS, CATS, KIDS or APARTMENTS. \n** Smokey will need a home with at least 1 acre & 6 ft. fence.\nPlease fill out a application at www.secondchancedogs.net \n\nAdoption donation is $350\n\n\n\nHis  bark is loud and can intimidate people not experienced with large breed dogs. He's pretty harmless tho. He loves to go on car rides, splash in water, drink from the hose, play fetch and at times forgets his size. He must have a secure 6 ft fence, an active owner that can take him for long walks or runs. If you are interested in meeting this boy please fill out an application for review. \n\nAdoption donation is $350\n\n",

I was rescued from an over crowded shelter along with my two sisters. My sisters have long been adopted, but I\u2019m still patiently waiting for my furever home. \nLook, I\u2019m a total sweetheart! I love other dogs, kids and cats. Everyone! And I think you\u2019ll love me!!\nI\u2019m about 30 lbs currently and expected to be in the medium to large size range when fully grown. I would make the perfect addition to any family!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Her ten puppies are all healthy and thriving and in their forever homes, now it's Daisy's turn to get to be a dog instead of a mom! Daisy needs very secure fencing and a home with another playful, energetic dog in the home. She can go to a home with or without kids, no cats or prey animals though.\n\nShe would love to be adopted with her playmate Hera who is also fostered by her foster family, another beautiful young hound lady!

She's crate trained, walks decently on a leash, likes kids, is incredibly loving and friendly with people, and LOVES other dogs. She needs an owner with experience working with high prey drive dogs and LOVES chenneling her drive with toys and fetch. Her ten puppies are all healthy and thriving and in their forever homes, now it's Daisy's turn to get to be a dog instead of a mom! Daisy needs very secure fencing and a home with another playful, energetic dog in the home. She can go to a home with or without kids, no cats or prey animals though.\n\nShe would love to be adopted with her playmate Hera who is also fostered by her foster family, another beautiful young hound lady!

She knows commands of shake and sit, outside, inside. She is loving, loyal and very affectionate. She wants to be with you. She is approx. 90 pounds. She eats from a slow feed bowl. It is better she eats alone due to food aggression. She does not like other animals around during feeding; however we can stick our hand in her bowl while she eats. She is currently living with other dogs and cats. She is okay with older dogs of similar size that leave her alone but is aggressive at times if animals come near her head (especially when laying down). She is ok with cats if the cats keep their distance. She lives with 3 inside. She does not like stray cats. She does not like dogs that are small or especially puppies. She has a strong prey drive. Her ideal home would be as only pet or one additional dog of similar age.",

She knows how to use a doggie door, rides well in the car, and will probably try to sleep in bed with you. She never wore a collar or was on leash in her previous home (her owner passed away). She is wearing a collar but isnt a fan if having a leash attached or detached (she doesnt like you going near collar), but is slowly learning to walk on a leash. She isn't a fan of the vet or groomer.\n\nWe would like to find a home with a yard, to minimize the need for walks and leashing. She is currently fostering with her litter sister, Willow.\n\nSister is good with other dogs and kids. She prefers indoors to out and can be shy with strangers (she may go hide). She is microchipped and has her rabies vaccine and takes no medications.\n\nto learn about adoption, visit www.peipeople.com",

He loves nice pets, carrots, the occasional rope toy, and the company of other dogs.\n\nPoppop has diabetes and because of that, he\u2019s going to need someone who can afford the insulin he needs, as well as grain-free dog food that helps maintain healthy glucose levels.\n\nOther than diabetes, Poppop is a low-maintenance dog.\n\nAlthough he probably would do best somewhere with a yard, I can see him doing okay in a smaller living space since he mostly likes to nap while in the house and will let you know when he needs to relieve himself.\n\nPoppop does enjoy the company of other dogs.  However, he likes to take time for himself when needed (to nap). He\u2019s also taken to children well. Poppop cannot be around cats, however, since they trigger his hunting instinct.\n\nTo adopt/meet Poppop, apply at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption application\n",

BUT, I know this and sometimes act out to see if I can get away with it. It will be important to be a strong, dog-savvy pack leader with me. I will resource guard my toys and treats, can be leash reactive, and am not a big fan of the word NO. I\u2019m good with kids big and small when in a control environment with a pack leader.  I\u2019m a little more wary around men, so will just need a slow, relaxed introduction. Look at this little face (ok, yeah....and my cute little stocky legs)...,come meet me, I\u2019m worth it! \n\nI do have a bite history. Part of resource guarding is growling and lunging at individuals. This is what I was doing when I bit a previous owner in November 2020.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.).

We would like for him to go to a rescue organization that can provide that much needed socialization and love to help build his confidence and show him that everything is alright.\n\nplease contact Diana at alcazar.diana@gmail.com",

He is UTD, neutered, crate trained, and house broken. He is a SUPER sweet and cuddly baby who would do great in a house or an apt. Milo is medium energy so he would be wonderful for someone looking for a walking buddy annnnd a cuddle buddy! \n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo other pets \n\tNo individuals under 16\n\tDog experience \n \n\n\nPlease note, Milo is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program.

PLEASE FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, ONCE PRE-APPROVED, GIVE US A CALL AND WE CAN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO MEET ME!\n\nI am 63 lbs., 4 years old, and l am looking for my forever home.\n\nAdoption Donation: $400\n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus; Vectra 3D.\n\nAll household members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available.  As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ.

I can\u2019t believe King has been at the shelter since July and this is only our second update for him! I just keep thinking that someone will pick him, but it hasn\u2019t happened. Because he can be reactive on the fence line to some dogs, we tested him today face-to-face with Serna, a large female dog. He was great! He wiggled and play bowed nicely\u2013I think he\u2019d make a great companion for a friendly female dog! \n\nKing has been treated for heartworms so he\u2019s ready to find his forever family now!\n\nKing was the first dog I took out this morning. He was happy to see me, and I was just as happy to be with him. I loved his enthusiasm! He chased a few tennis balls but decided it was just too hot to bring them back. Sitting in the shade getting pets was probably a better choice for such a warm day. \n\nKing is a sweet, friendly fellow who\u2019ll make you smile! To meet King or learn more about adopting or rescuing him, please contact the shelter at 706-613-3540.\n\nYou can read more about this dog and check out additional photos here: https://athenspets.net/Adoptables/53881-king/ OR check out our urgent dogs (http://tinyurl.com/Athenspets-FB-URGENT-Dogs) on Facebook!\n\nThis dog is currently at Athens-Clarke County Animal Control, located at 125 Buddy Christian Way, Athens, GA.

Though if you ask him it's seven young, not old.  \nHe is just searching for the perfect lap to sit next to. He likes slow walks around the parks, back scratches, and treats. All of which he would love to share with his new family.\nHe is a big dachshund and chihuahua mix hitting the scales at ten pounds. Yet, that's what the long walks are for!\nCurrently Bailey lives in a home with other dogs, ranging from twelve pounds to sixty. He gets along with all of them well. He would do best in a home without young children.\n\n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $275. covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",
