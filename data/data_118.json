            "description": "Birthdate: 4/15/2015\n\nBreed: One of a kind\n\nOur handsome boy Messi matches his soccer namesake in grace and footwork! His super-stardom knows no bounds! Messi just needs the right coach to help him reach his full potential. He is a top notch fetch player! Messi is around 4 years old but set his sights on a pool, stream or river and he goes into full puppy mode with excitement, splish splashing about in the water. After a bit of exercise, he enjoys lounging about in the sun or snuggling with his buddies. Messi also likes spending time with his dog teammates as well! \n\n*Messi is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Messi, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Messi, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Messi, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

            "description": "Available in the Midwest and New England regions - Meet RALPH!\n\nRalph!  Our big boy Ralph has a few similarities to the movie Wreck-it Ralph\u2019s main character. Both Ralph\u2019s want to be a hero and fulfill their dream. Our Ralph\u2019s dream is to have a home of his own with an active family who will love him. Ralph is going to save you from a life of boredom.  \n\nRalph is approximately 3 years old. He is a stunningly gorgeous, smart, strong, active, high energy dog, who needs a firm handler and an adopter committed to training. Ralph loves people! Ralph is a very nice dog and has all the potential to be a well-behaved dog. He just needs to learn all the rules and have an owner who is consistent with the rules. Ralph already knows sits on command and takes treats nicely. Ralph is very dominant, so he needs to be the only dog in the home or go to a home with a very submissive dog. Having a dominant dog is controllable and manageable and a qualified trainer will teach you all the tricks and techniques. Do not confuse dominance with aggression. Ralph just believes what is his, is his and what is yours is his. He does not like to share anything with his dog buddies. Because of his dominant nature, Ralph needs to go to a home with older children.\n\nOn the plus side, Ralph loves to play and would make a great walking, jogging or hiking partner. He enjoys his toys and loves play time outside. He does play hard but he also settles down nicely.  \n\nRalph will chase cats, squirrels, and other small animals. Ralph will need a fenced-in yard, no electric fence for this guy. Ralph is current on vaccinations and is on monthly preventives. He will be microchipped before adoption. Ralph keeps his kennel clean, but continued house training will be needed.  \n\nPlease do not overlook this gem. He is a little rough around the edges, but with the right owner and training, you will have a great dog and lifelong companion.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at www.luckylabrescue.com",

Kelly is guessed to be 5 years old and has already spent 3 Christmases at Satchel's. She has so many volunteer fans who don't understand why she is still at the shelter because she is so loving. It could be that her body is unable to keep her kidney values stable without some help from subcutaneous fluids. We don't really know why but with her twice a week flulid supplements, her values remain stable. Our vet doesn't believe this will, in any way, shorten her life or cause her any pain as long as she continues to get her fluids. She patiently stands for the 15 minutes it takes to give them to her. So should this really be why she has to live out her life at a shelter? Please consider opening up your heart and home to Kelly and give yourself an amazing Christmas present in 2020. A present that should go on giving for many, many years.\nKelly weighs approximately 55 lbs and is guessed to be 5years old. For an appointment to meet her, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070.",

Children tend to scare me so I do need a home with no little ones please.\nHoward weighs approximately 50 lbs and is guessed to be about 6 years old.

She continues to amaze us with her calm, happy, and goofy demeanor!\n\nMiss Veya has decided in her golden girls that she would like to be the only four legger in the home, it's her time to shine! She likes to relax, go on walks, play, snuggle in the bed, ride in the car, watch you eat or cook, and she is easily directed when you want her to go outside, into a kennel or car, etc.\n\nVeya will warm your heart and your feet! (She loves to sleep on your feet when you are sitting down.) Veya is very food-motivated and only wants to please her human! Thanks to brisk walks, Veya has shed some unwanted pounds and is full of energy!\n\nVeya has never had an accident in the house, never destroyed anything and has never showed any type of aggression toward kids/adults.\n\nVeya had surgery and had one of her hips removed to remove a total hip replacement later on down the road. Due to this, she needs a home with no stairs and will need ongoing medication. ($20 cost each month).\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or email",

My perfect home would be an experienced female owner versus a first time owner. I would really like a fenced yard to run and play in and also someone who takes me for walks or on some adventures. I adore trails and stuff but am not a huge fan of swimming. If you can help me I know I can be a very good boy and will become your best friend too. Grayson is a beautiful pittie/pointer, male with green eyes. He will melt your heart. He has been at Castoff way too long. Grayson would make a fabulous companion for any woman. He loves the ladies. He is the type of dog that shows total loyalty and protection. Grayson needs a fenced hard so he can run. He loves attention, loves to run and play but is not great with other animals. In his past he has been abused and thankfully he came to Castoff. This is why we are looking for a female that would love a great watchdog and a forever companion. He is totally vetted, and walks well on a leash. He would need to be a only pet and he is way ready to find his person. 2/1/21 2:28 PM",

            "description": "Sammi (Samet) came to us from Thailand where she lived at en elephant sanctuary until being flown here in late 2016. She's been fostering with the same Underdogs foster ever since and they think she's just a sweet, sweet doll! When she first arrived in the U.S., she would hide under the couch or bed all day and only come out at night, but she's improved about 1000%. She really likes familiar situations, places, dogs, and people. (For instance, she LOVES her dog friends.) Walks and car rides are still a bit spooky, but she makes strides every day. She loves cuddling in bed at night, and does NOT like being crated. In short, Sammi is a sweet, gentle, timid lovebug who is searching for her very patient and understanding forever home.\n\nUnderdogs Rescue has partnered up with the Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand to help save some of the 400+ dogs they have living on the sanctuary. While most of these dogs have come to the park following natural disasters or from situations some of us couldn't even fathom, these dogs are full of heart and ready to begin a new life in the US with a family to love them!! More information about ENP can be found on their website here: http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/ Help us help them by fostering or adopting one or more of these sweet babies looking for a new life!\n\nSammi is spayed, up-to-date on basic vaccinations and microchipped. Our Underdogs adult dog adoption fee is $300, which includes spay/neuter, microchip, and up-to-date vaccinations. \n\nIf you're interested in adopting Sammi, please fill out an adoption application here: https://underdogsrescue.org/adopt-form/\n\nUnderdogs is a small volunteer-based animal rescue and we unfortunately do not have the resources to respond to phone and email inquires about our adoptable animals at this time. If you're interested in learning more or setting up a meeting with one of our animals, please complete an adoption application first. It may take up to two weeks for application review and one of our coordinators will reach out to you as soon as we are through the intitial review process. We appreciate your patience and understanding! Thank you!",

This lady enjoys her daily walks, tries to play ball (she used to love it in her younger years, but she has slowed down quite a bit in recent months) and is not shy about letting you know she is going to be the only animal in your life (cats, birds, lizards, dogs, tasty little rodents, etc. are declared an invasive species and she will dispatch them at her earliest convenience) but she LOVES people and is quite affectionate. She may only have a few years to offer you her love, but those years are the best years she has to offer. She is not a good candidate for dog parks. Shenandoah weighs between 50-60 pounds. She qualifies for Silver Paws program, matching senior dogs to seniors. Adoption fee is paid by the Paws for Love Foundation. Wouldn't you like to be the one who shows her how wonderful life in a home would be for her last few years?",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Monkey has scars all over her body, had a broken leg that we surgically repaired, and is sight impaired in one eye. Despite the horrific treatment this sweet girl has previously endured, you will be hard pressed to find a sweeter dog. Monkey was born around 5/17/15 and our best guess and is she a bully/lab mix. She does great with adults, kids, and with other dogs who are not jumping on her (especially coming from her side with her impaired eye). She is too interested in cats, so we think she would do best in a feline free home. She loves attention and is quick to reward you with a smile, a hug, and maybe even a kiss. If you are looking for a special furbaby that may not win a beauty pageant, come meet Monkey and watch her win your heart. Monkey is in an Amazing Foster home and her family will tell you that this cutie is a real Doll! Amazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have an actual facility and our fosters are spread all over the local area. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to complete our online application and we will contact you as soon as we can.\n\nOur adoption fee for Monkey is completely sponsored to an approved home. Monkey is already spayed, current on shots and rabies, and microchipped.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to call/text us at (850) 723-2037. 2/1/21 10:04 PM",

A loving boy, he adores his people and wiggles his whole body excitedly in greeting. This boy\u2019s favorite place is wherever you are   so he prefers to sleep in the room with you, whether that be in a doggie bed or - if you happen to like to share - your bed.  Hikes are one of his favorite things, but he\u2019s equally happy having a snooze or playing in the house or yard.  \n\nIntelligent and eager to please, Luke LOVES learning. He already knows sit, stay, paw, high-five, wave, roll over and even knows how to wind through legs, spin and jump! He enjoys playing with his canine foster sibling but would be just as happy as a solo dog. Luke is uncertain around children, so would need an adult home or a home with older children.\n\nLuke is a smart, loyal, and loving guy who is hoping to finally settle in a forever home!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

On Nov 7th 2017 I want to go meet this girl after my personal dog had passed away and I felt such an immediate connection with her that I took her with me into my rescue she was terrified and she disn't have a clue what was going on. It took a few days for her to settle in and after she went through her stray hold because there was originally a microchip that was found in her from overseas..We attempted to backtrace up microchip to no Avail and when her stray hold was up she came home. She will not pee or poop inside the house however she can be destructive unless she is given more 1 on 1 time then she is an angel. She is a Velcro dog that is playful and loving. So sweet and obsessed with licking hands. \n\nShe is heartworm positive and her slow treatment is included.\n\nIf you are intereted please provide a phone nmber with your inquiry. Inquiries without phone numbers will not be entertained for adoption.\u00a0 This request is due to poor email transcription with pefinder and emails not going to sender boxes ..or spam not checked.\u00a0 Thank you for understanding and coopration.\u00a0\n\n",

He has a moderate energy level and is crate-trained and housebroken.  He is good with older kids and some dogs and we are continuing to work on his interactions with other dogs.  He is not good with cats.    \n \nFor more information or to request an adoption application, please email us at adoption.mtgsr@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION: \nTraining (for both the dog AND the family) increases the probability of a successful adoption. We feel strongly that training is an essential part of responsible dog ownership and we now require training for every dog placed through the MTGSR program. The cost of adoption is $500 which includes the $250 adoption fee and a training fee of $250 due at the time of adoption.\n\nFor the adoption fee, the dog will be spayed/neutered, current on all vaccinations, current on heartworm/flea-tick preventatives and microchipped.\n\nThe training fee will include a plan tailored to that specific dog and that dog's needs (obedience training, behavior modification, etc.) and typically includes three private training sessions.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Our philosophy is \u201cRescue locally, place locally\u201d which means we primarily pull dogs from shelters in the Nashville area AND we prefer to place our dogs in homes within a one-hour drive of Nashville. If you are outside of the Nashville area, please consider adopting a homeless dog in your local community.\n",

A home visit by a volunteer is required before an application can be approved.  ********************************************************************************************\nJoey is a super handsome fellow, just under a year old.\n\nHe was supposed to be a Sheltie but kept growing and growing...   Then a DNA test showed he is a Collie.\n\nHe just grew too large for his family.   They loved him to pieces but he knocks the little one down wagging his tail.  They wanted a small dog for their family and Joey is certainly not small.\n\nJoey does fine with other confident dogs but can be a bully if there are shy.  He will not be placed in a home with a shy or reserved companion dog.  \n\nHe is a good traveler and great with children.\n\nAdoption fee is  $350 and an obedience class is required.\nAPPLY to adopt at www.sheltierescue.org\n\n",

He is good with other dogs his size.\nFor further information please email the address in the box to the right.

            "description": "Posted 12/2/17, and pictures taken on 9/1/17.  Dahlia was transferred to me on 8/31/17 from the Rebel Ranch Rescue after the founder, Amy Allen, was murdered on 8/21/17.  Dahlia was one of 4 dogs still there that other rescue groups chose not to take.  She was scared and tried to chew the leash the first attempt to get her out of her dog pen, so a second leash was used as a muzzle.  She was also hiding in a hole under her dog house.  She had a male dog in the dog pen with her named Artie, who seemed to be attached to her.\n\nAfter being in a dog pen for about one week.  I decided to start letting Dahlia and Artie out to run, and they would chase each other around and then run back into the dog pen when done.  Dahlia also LOVES to get in water.  After another week of this, I decided to leave the gate open all the time.  They eventually moved to another section of our property.  Dahlia started climbing our 4 foot perimeter fence and running around the wooded area, but Artie has stayed on our property and made friends with the other dogs here, so he is not as attached to Dahlia as I first thought.  Dahlia got to where she came up to me to get pet, so it was easy to catch her when she was outside our property.  I put her in a small secure kennel at first with some can food, so she knew that going in that kennel meant can food when I needed to catch her again.  I now have her in a secure 6 foot tall dog pen.  She first found a way out through the chain link on top by getting on top of a dog house, but the chain link is now secure to the railing.  She needs a lot of space to run with a tall secure fence, and a source of water to get into.  It would be nice if she could get a job to do, since she is very trainable, and it might help keep her at a home.\n\nDahlia was already spayed when transferred, and heartworm negative on 9/1/17.\nD.O.B.:     ? August 2013\nWeight:     47.6 - 9/1/17\n\n$25 adoption fee.",

Artie was one of 4 dogs still there that other rescue groups chose not to take.  He was scared and tried to chew the leash the first attempt to get him out of his dog pen, so a second leash was used as a muzzle.  He seemed to be very attached to his companion Dahlia who shared his dog pen, so was happy to be in a crate next to her for the drive back to our property.\n\nAfter being in a dog pen for about one week.  I decided to start letting Artie and Dahlia out to run, and they would chase each other around and then run back into the dog pen when done.  After another week of this, I decided to leave the gate open all the time.  They eventually moved to another section of our property.  Dahlia started climbing our 4 foot perimeter fence, but Artie has stayed on our property and made friends with the other dogs here, so he is not as attached to Dahlia as I first thought.  He is still skittish of people, but loves treats and can food, which has made him feel comfortable enough to come up to me on occasion to let me pet him.  At first I had to throw treats to him, but now he will take them from my hand, and especially will come for a spoon of can food.  He needs a home that will be patient with him, other dogs to play with, and a large fenced area.  He likes to get on top of dogs houses and other things to lay down on, and knows where the treats are, so will get into the bags if not sealed up.  I was told that Amy called him Smarty Artie.  He also has an underbite, which may indicate he is part Boxer.\n\nArtie was already neutered when transferred, and heartworm negative on 9/1/17.\nD.O.B.:     ? 2014\nWeight:     45.4 - 9/1/17\n\n$25 adoption fee.",

Asia was part of the Rebel Ranch Rescue, and she was transferred to me when the founder of the Rebel Ranch Rescue, Amy Allen, was murdered on 8/21/17.  Amy had just gotten Asia from the Smith County Animal Shelter on 8/11/17.\n\nAsia is playful and high energy, so she will need a home that will help her work that energy off, and she will need a fenced yard; no apartment.  Asia tries to climb in my lap, always jumping on me, always right by me wanting attention to get pet, and LOVES to chase after water from a water hose.  Asia actually settles down while she is being pet, but should not be around smaller children due to her high energy.  She is in an outside fenced area, so it is unknown if she is house or crate trained, and is good on a leash.  Asia has a huge heart shaped patch on the Right side of her body.\n\nAsia was spayed on 8/28/17.\nD.O.B.:     ? January 2017\nWeight:     32.2 - 8/28/17; 54.0 - 6/19/20\n\n$80 adoption fee.",

            "description": "Some facts about Layla.\n\nHer vital stats:\n- She's truly the perfect size for most homes. She's small enough that you can easily pick her up - 33 lbs. (and she doesn't mind being picked up when you need to do it), but has a \"big dog\" personality (not yappy or nervous at all).\n\nBasic Information:\n- house-trained\n- crate-trained (but doesn't NEED to be in a crate - she's perfectly safe when left loose in the house)\n- peppy when she's outside, but calm inside the house\n- snuggly - loves to sit on your lap\n- playful - giver her a good toy and she's happy for a long time (heck, she's even happy to chase her tail if she's got no toys around)\n- adorable - her little tongue is too big for her mouth, so about an inch of the tip often hangs out; extremely cute\n- would love to get on the furniture, but doesn't mind when you say no (i.e., she listens to you)\n- food-driven, so she's good at training, but not so food-driven that she tries to get the food off your plate (see above she listens well)\n- only barks when she hears the doorbell or noises outside (in other words, not a nervous dog that barks at everything)\n- independent - she is not needy in the least; at the same time, she's loving and excited to see you/be with you when you come home\n\nLayla will do well with a house without children and will need a compatibility test with another dog. She gets along well with some and not so well with others.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Layla, please visit www.pawsitiveimpactncdogrescue.com/adopt.\n\nPINC's adoption fee covers shots through the date of adoption (all puppies receive 2 vaccinations before adoption), surgery (spay or neuter), microchip and microchip registration.\n",

He's not marking as much, and he's very slowly learning to stand down when he's overwhelmed by the urge to protect. He's definitely not the dog for your average family, but in a home with no or few other animals (no alphas) he could be someone's best buddy forever. He does have a very sweet and cuddly side, and we're continuing to work to let that shine through. If you've ever wanted to rescue an animal purely for the sake of the animal, and are willing to work to save this boy, then he would love you for it for the rest of his days.\n\nThor's come a long way since being pulled off the streets of San Antonio. He's had a heart workup to make sure he's OK for anesthesia (neuter), and he's put on a little bit of weight so he's not just skin and bones.\nThis boy's had a rough life, and he still has some aggression issues with my pig, but he's learned to accept and interact with other dogs and people. He still requires careful observation, but he really has come so far!\nWe're still working on marking, although he's improving. Whomever adopts him needs to understand he requires some patience and understanding. If you can offer him those, then you'll have a dog who loves and adores you!\n2/2/21 6:06 PM",

Born in early 2017, Gracie was extremely emaciated when she came into rescue: at only 16 pounds, she was only half of what her body weight should have been and in addition, she had an ulcerated eye, demodex mange, anemia, parasites, was dehydrated, and her two rear paws were swollen and infected with puncture wounds there and on her neck. Gracie has made a full recovery and is searching hard for her forever home. We just don't understand why she is still in foster and has not been adopted yet! This young girl needs a home with another confident dog as she is submissive and timid. When first being introduced into your home, she may be scared and timid, but given her previous 'life' its no wonder! Her home should not have cats, and should be one where there is a fairly established routine. She absolutely thrives in a home where expectations do not change. Gracie is house trained, potty trained, leash trained and crate trained and in fact will seek out her crate when she feels nervous. If you have a loving home that fits this description and would like to adopt Gracie and give her a chance, please apply here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

This sweet pup was abandoned on the side of a country road with a bag of dog food. I happened upon her, and she has been with me for over a month. Mamie Sue has integrated into my herd with no problems...she gets along well with male or female dogs. She perks up when she sees one of my cats, but has not attacked them. She is probably under a year old, possibly around 10 to 11 months old, is housebroke, and absolutely adorable. If you think you would be able to give Mamie Sue a forever home, let me know. She will have all her shots, and is scheduled to be spayed on the 31st. Her adoption fee will be $100.00, and this only helps to defray part of the cost of her vetting.

The fur may never grow back on her face (we think she is adorable!)  She also has a club foot that does not cause her any problems.\n\nDaphne takes her meds without complaining and is doing fabulous in her foster home.   But there are a lot of dogs there and we think she'd be happier in a less \"congested\" atmosphere.\n\nShe is available for our Seniors for Seniors discount.

She has a fungul infection on her skin, is prone to seizures (cause unknown and they have stopped) and she has a Grade 4 heart murmur.\n\nShe is on tons of meds and she doesn't complain about taking any of them\n\nCan we tell you how much longer she will live?   Nope, but we couldn't guarantee that with ANY dog.   We do know that since she's been out of the shelter her seizures have stopped, her skin has improved and she looks and acts 100% better than she did when we first got her out of the shelter.\n\nShe's a nice dog.   She needed a break to thrive and she got one in her new foster home.  But there are a lot of dogs there and she'd REALLY thrive in a home with less dogs.   \n\nBonnie is eligible for our Seniors for Seniors discount.\n\nTo apply, please go to http://dawgsquad.org/adoption-application/",

They are senior sweeties who not only love each other but kids and cats and other dogs too. Ellie is the absolute most gentle and easy going dog ever. She loves to be in the sun. Playful and very cuddly. Her eyes say it all. Sometimes happy sometimes they say Please love me. Do you love me? Ellie is almost 8\nWaldo is so cute and super playful even at almost 9 yrs old. He will play ball with you all day long. He prefers women and sometimes meeting new men but warms up very quickly. Slow gentle introductions are best for a new home. Lovers of The Wizard of Oz will love this Toto look alike.\nIf you are interested in learning more about these dogs or in adopting them, please click here to email their foster parent or call 818 317-6191,If you are unable to send an email to the foster parent through the link included above, please contact us and let us know what kitty you're interested in.

            "description": "Hi everyone! I'm Nola and I'm a 9-year-old female Shiba Inu (mix?) who came to SIRA as a stray. I may be little at 20lbs, but I have a big personality! My foster parents say that I am a very loving girl and have brought so much joy to my foster home. My favorite things are to welcome my humans when they come home, cuddle on the bed, get good pets, go on walks, and to to go outside to search for chipmunks in the yard. My least favorite things are to be crated and the sound of wheels that zip by me (bicycles, cars, etc). I am a good girl when I'm left at home uncrated all day while my foster parents are at work (no accidents, no chewing). The minute my foster parents get home, I rush to the door to give them tons of kisses and tell them how much I missed them! I love people and give lots of attention to my human friends. It might take me a little while to feel safe and secure in a new home. You see, I get anxious in a new environment and will bark a lot to let you know that I'm feeling unsure, especially if you step out of the room or leave home without me. So it will be important for my new family to be patient and plan for ways to help me to adjust during the transition (if you live in a home where barking won't disturb your neighbors, that's good too!). I get along great with my foster Shiba sister. However, I don't get along well with dogs that I don't know. Because of this, my foster parents think that I might do best in a home with no other dogs. I might learn to enjoy living with other even-tempered similarly sized dog(s), but my new humans would need to commit to a slow, gradual integration process. I have not lived with cats before, but because of my strong prey drive (yeah, I really like to chase those chipmunks!) a home without cats or other small pets would be best. I really like being outside and love to go for walks in my secure harness. Like most Shibas, I need to stay on-leash at all times when outside or be supervised in a very securely fenced backyard to prevent me from getting loose. My foster family says that I'm a generally healthy girl, with a few things that need monitoring. My left eye was removed in June of 2018 due to glaucoma. It doesn\u2019t slow me down at all and I still have some vision out of my right eye, even though that one has a cataract and is at risk of developing glaucoma too. I get eye drops every day to help maintain healthy eye pressure. Like many older girls, I have a few other issues to be aware of, which mostly don\u2019t bother me: occasional back pain, a slight heart murmur, airway sensitivity, and luxating patella (loose knee caps) in both knees. My foster parents say I'm a tough cookie (and also a sweetheart)! If you'd like to be my forever family and you live in the midwest, visit www.savingshibas.com/adopt for more information and to download an application to become an approved SIRA adopter. I am being fostered in Wisconsin.",

And I don't like it when other dogs are by my food, but I am, generally speaking, a good boy who wants a family to love and to play with.\n\nBut again, I probably WOULD DO BETTER being the only dog. I can be a butt head at times. That is why I am a special needs.\n\nI probably need a family with bigger kids because I forget my strength sometimes. :)\n\nOh! The last photo shows how sweet I look when I am sleeping. I love cuddling up with a blanket, and even a towel.\n\nI can be so adorable when I am not being a butt head.\"\n\nAs with all our foster dog children, Toad has been altered, microchipped and has had his shots.\nPlease call or text Bob at (623) 680-1170 for more information on this big, gentle-hearted brute.\nJanuary 2021: THE USUAL ADOPTION FEE FOR DOGS/PUPPIES VARIES GIVEN AGE, BREED, ETC..

            "description": "Age: 6 yo Years\n\nWeight: 54 lbs\n\nLocation: RI\n\nThis dog is available for adoption to all New England residents, and\n\nhas been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nHello Friends, my name is Goldy!\nI am a fabulous blend of boxer and shepherd, well that's what the humans say at least. I consider myself rather intelligent, curious and goofy. Let's just say I know the basic doggie commands like the back of my paw, as long as treats are provided! Whether it's Netflix and treats, a hike on your favorite trails or a trip to the beach, I'm your girl!\n\nLike any other pup, I have some preferences I would like you to know about. Though I play well with other dogs, I would love to be the center of attention at home, sorry doggie friends! I look at cats and think, no, thank you, move along please or the prey drive kicks in. Though smaller humans are cute, I am not my best possible self around them. Therefore, no kids in the house is a requirement for my adoption! Actually, I'm all about the adult only lifestyle. This party is 21+ please.\n\nDid you say RULES? If so, that is right up my alley! I like knowing what to expect and having a plan. While I can definitely rally for spontaneous adventures (or cuddle times) with my person, I excel in predictable environments. For example, I would prefer to avoid surprises when rounding a corner, unexpected house guests or deliveries, sharing my food or toys at home with other dogs. I have A TON of training under my belt, and have a redirection cue for these types of situations. While it will take some work, I have confidence that I can get you up to speed on those skills with some effort and time and some help from a professional trainer.\n\nYou know what I bet you would love to hear, a house-trained AND crate-trained dog AND leash-trained dog. Oh hey, that's me! That's right folks, not only am I good looking, but I am smart, too! Speaking of savvy and intelligent, I LOVE puzzle games. While the humans enjoy Scrabble, I enjoy something called a Wobbler (Wonderful Obstacle Building Blob Leaving Endless Rewards) or at least that's what I think it stands for.\n\nSo, what do you think? I know I'm asking for a lot in my new home, but I also love a lot and in the right match, I promise I am not high maintaince! Won't you give me a chance to fill that empty space in your heart and make it Goldyen? If so, apply for me today!\n\nGoldy's Backstory: While we don't know all the details of her history, when Goldy came into our partner rescue in January 2017, she was skin and bones. She likely was not exposed to many positive things, so she is still learning about, and becoming comfortable with, the active human environment. She continues to make great progress learning that her first reaction to new things should not be concern (bark/lunging). She needs a confident, dog-savvy person who is committed to continuing to work with her on this and manage her environment. With the right handler, she could likely be trained to be an exceptional working dog.\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website:\n\nwww.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.\n\n2/2/21 2:49 PM",

            "description": "Horace is a 9 year old Male Poodle on the larger end of measurements from the local shelter and a super sweet boy. He loves to cuddle with his human and would be best as the only dog. He is crate trained and working on potty training but does have a doggie door. \n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog.

            "description": "Meet this beautiful little girl, Olive. She absolutely adores being around people. She will sit in your lap and roll around. Olive loves to be pet and rubbed behind the ears. She will give you kisses while you pet her. Her soft fur feels like cashmere and her markings are adorable. What a beauty!\n\nOlive is around 2 years old.  The first part of her little life is somewhat of a mystery. She was discovered after being abandoned in a cardboard box, together with another pup. A good Samaritan brought her to the Anti Cruelty Society where volunteers contacted IEBR. Olive has now been in her temporary foster home for one week and this is where she has responded so well to love and adoration. \n\nOlive is very mobile, she walks and runs around and loves to explore the garden rolling around in the grass and chasing leaves. Olive can climb up two steps and navigate furniture, toys or any obstacle in front of her. She will run into your arms if you call her name! She does have the tendency to have her back legs collapse when she is standing idle, hinting at some mobility functional shortfalls.\n\nOlive loves squeaky toys. She knows how to bite them repeatedly to make the sound continue non-stop. She quickly drops one toy to run to the next. Rope toys are a must for this chewing bulldog pup. She loves to chew so when she comes for your shoes (and your feet!) you have to distract her with a toy. She drops to her blankets and bed when she is tired, napping regularly and settling well through the night. \n\nOlive eats three small meals a day of puppy food. We add a bit of Organic pumpkin to keep her stools regular. She gobbles all her food quickly and carries the dish around when she is finished. \n\nOlive has Spina Bifida and is incontinent she does wear diapers.  \n\nUpdate 7/8/19\nOlive is now a very happy and energetic 2y/o. She does have spina bifida and has issues with some dragging of her back right leg especially as she gets tired. She wears diapers and has quite the wardrobe of covers and outfits. She loves everyone and has no idea of personal space. She loves playing outside and snuggling on the couch. She is a toy hoarder but does it so cutely it\u2019s impossible for anyone to get upset. Her favorite thing is to play a rousing game of \u201cbite my nose\u201d especially after I have been at work she gets on the couch and it\u2019s just so much fun for her to try to give you a \u201ckiss\u201d right in the nose!!! She loves it and gets so excited.\nShe has very little maintenance. Her wrinkles are small and stay clear. Her back foot has to be protected. She only plays in the yard and on soft surfaces. She loves toys and other dogs and cats are fine.\n\nOlive is truly a love muffin that is going to make some lucky family very happy. \nIf you are interested in Olive, please visit our website:  www.ilenglishbulldogrescue.org, and read through our adoption criteria to see if you meet our requirements.  If you do, please fill out an application to adopt.\nOlive\u2019s adoption fee is:   $650.00\nVisit us on Facebook:  Visit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IllinoisEnglishBulldogRescue",

            "description": "Scooter came to FARM over a year ago in need of a forever home. He is an 10 year old, 6 pound neutered male Chihuhua. Scooter is looking for a Chihuahua savvy home. He can be a very sweet boy who will smother his favorite people with kisses, but he also has a very stubborn side. He needs an adopter who understand this stubborn behavior and will give him his space when he is feeling grouchy.  He is reported to be housebroken and crate trained. He has done well with other dogs his own size in his foster home. \n\n**Only very experienced and patient dog people should apply - he has significant behavior issues that you cannot \"love away\". You will need to respect his boundaries and be okay working around his terms.**\n\nIf you wish to be considered for this animal, please download an application at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ or email fallstonrescue@aol.com to request one. It can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond. \n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications on one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n",

This crazy gal is looking for a fun and adventurous new home.  She is a very energetic dog. She loves to play with all the dog especially those who are young energetic pup and we are requiring her to go to a home with another dog as we believe she would do better in a home with another dog to play with.   We believe her to be two to three years old as of 2019.  She will need someone willing to train her, play with her and handle her energy level.  Being a young dog she has a lot of energy but with playtime and walks she also knows how to chill out.  She MUST have a playmate that can hang with her. Autumn is an amazing dog who loves all other dogs.  She is just a big goofy kid.  She MUST have a privacy fence as she can clear a chain link fence.  She is a rescue favorite.  www.route66petrescue.org for an application.",

She does not do well with other dogs or small animals so it is best that she be an only pet.  She does have a special diet of Purina ONE Smartblend True Instict, canned pumpkin and yogurt with a morning Pepcid.  Yes, she is spoiled..  :)\n\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FROM OUR WEBSITE: www.hoperescues.com.  Our adoption fee is $225.00 for all our dogs. \nThis fee includes: Spay/Neuter, microchip, all current vaccinations, and flea/tick treatment. Our dogs are also given monthly heart worm medication in our care.\nDisclaimer: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of our dogs, we are only guessing at breed mix.

THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION\n\nMEET BEAU!\u00a0 This little 11-lb, 4-year-old, white Maltipoo mix (our best guess) came to us from the Palmdale shelter.\u00a0 The family who surrendered him to the shelter reported that his parents were brother and sister. :(\n\nPoor Beau was not blessed with good health.\u00a0 He is hypothyroid (managed with daily pills) and has elevated liver enzymes (also managed with medication).\u00a0 We believe that his inbreeding also resulted in a neurological condition called episodic ataxia.\u00a0 This condition manifests itself in Beau as seizure-like episodes where his legs stiffen and he can't walk.\u00a0 These episodes each last about 30-60 minutes and seem to occur most often when he is excited or stressed.\u00a0 Over the months we've had him, Beau's episodes have become less frequent, and about 90% of the time he behaves like a normal, happy boy!\u00a0 We are hopeful that he will lead a long, relatively-healthy life.\n\nBeau is extremely human-oriented and needs to find a home where someone is around most of the time.\u00a0 He is a velcro dog who will follow you from room to room.\u00a0 He loves to play with toys (especially those that squeak!) and gnaw on bones.\u00a0 He is mostly potty-pad trained, but does occasionally have accidents inside.\u00a0 Access to a yard may help with his house training.\u00a0 He could also use some training to curb his reactions to other dogs on-leash.\u00a0\n\nBeau is a total doll who's looking for a family that can embrace his medical needs and love him the way we do.\u00a0 Do you have room in your home and heart for this special boy?\n\nUPDATE (October 2020): We've had Beau on holistic medication (carefully monitored by a holistic vet) for several months, and he now rarely has episodes at all!\u00a0 His adopter should be willing to adopt this regimen so he can continue to thrive.\n\nOur website is updated daily. Please do not apply for this dog unless your home fits the specified criteria. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, groomed, vet checked, dewormed, deflea'd and come with a leash, collar and ID If you are interested in adopting this dog from Lhasa Happy Homes, please complete the adoption application via the link below: \n\nAdoption (Online) Application: https://lhasahappyhomes.org/adoptions/adoption-application/\n\n We will contact you once it has been reviewed. \n\nDuring the COVID-19 quarantine, Lhasa Happy Homes will NOT be holding weekly adoption events. We will set up individual meet & greets with APPROVED applicants once they have submitted a video tour of their home.\n\nYou can check our Events Calendar at http://www.lhasahappyhomes.org/HLM_Custom_Calendar.aspx.  \n\nThanks for thinking rescue and adoption\u2026and for considering saving a life. It will be the best gift you ever give yourself or your family.",

She does have some arthritis issues but she is taking medication that works well for her. Inez is doing well with housebreaking when watched closely. She is a sweet senior that would love to have a wonderful forever home. \n\nAn adoption application is required but does not commit you to adoption. For the application and information about the adoption process, please visit  www.bhrg.org.",

He does not do well with other animals and we recommend against small children due to his strength.  His adult owner should have lots of dog experience, preferably with a strong dog with a strong personality like Remy.  For the right person, he is the best friend you could ever want.\n\nHe loves to have his very own dog bed and prefers to get affection when he wants it, rather than having it forced upon him.  \n\nHe knows basic commands and he is crate trained and house broken.\n\nTo learn more contact us at adoption@ihadro.org or apply today at www.ihadro.org!

ALL DOGS LISTED ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n** Please read the bio in its entirety before emailing with questions or submitting an application**\n\nAs we are an all volunteer rescue with limited time to respond to emails, if you email us with questions that have already been answered in the bio, we won't be able to respond. We are being inundated with emails at the moment. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nAutumn has a gorgeous coat that looks and feels like velvet. She's very sweet and lovable, is playful, has lots of energy and loves everyone!\n\nShe likes other dogs but tends to play very rough and it can easily escalate without direct supervision, so she would do best in a home where she could be lavished with all of the attention. She is very eager to please and is treat motivated.\n\nMinimum Donation: $200 (All PawPrints dogs are HW Tested, on monthly HW prevention, up to date on vaccines, spayed and microchipped.\n\nWeight: 55 lbs\n\nDogs: Yes, but would be best as an only pet\n\nCats: No\n\nKids: No small children due to Autumns rambunctious style of play\n\nWhile viewing our available dogs, please understand that:\n\nIf you have a fence, it must be a physical fence\nWe do check personal and veterinary references. All current pets must be up to date on Rabies, spayed or neutered and on heartworm prevention (dogs).\nAdopters MUST live within a 2 hour radius of Florence Ky. (sorry, no exceptions)\nMeet and greets are arranged with an approved application which can be found online at pawprintsnky.com\nWhen you send messages/emails through adoption sites, our website, etc they all go to the same inbox.

We went to the vet this week and this boy was a rock star! He was saying hi to every one coming in. He was well mannered ...well except for the part where he kept trying to sit in my lap! This boy isnt quite ready for adoption but a foster to adopt would certainly be welcome!East TN Pit Bull Rescue adopts out to companion homes only. Adoptions require an application that is verified, a meeting that includes ALL members of the household, a home visit, and a trial period. We do not place our dogs in homes with unaltered pets or homes that have pets but do not have a vet. All of our dogs are placed as inside pets, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, vaccinations current, and HW- or treated within the last 6 months for heart worms by our vet. Adoption fees start at $150 for adults and $200 for pups. If you are interested in offering this pet a responsible and loving home, please fill out the on-line application at www.etnpitbullrescue.org.

She is currently looking for a forever home. Bella is wild and silly! She loves to play. Bella is very vocal and this can get her in trouble with some dogs. A structured home that will work with Bella on impulse control and outings would be best.

            "description": "FOUND !!!! Picked up as a stray by Lebanon TN Animal Control and scanned for a MICRO CHIP on July3rd, 2019. Picked up and brought home on July 5th, 2019.\n\nMy post on 7/06/19\nWell...for 3 days I have been trying to decide what I wanted to say about this. First 2 days, I was afraid it was not true. You see...5 years ago, I got a call about Max and his MICRO CHIP. I said can't be Max because he is DEAD! That is what his piece of shit adopter and family had told me! Paula Langford said brindle and BIGGEST HEAD I EVER SAW! I laughed, I cried, and then I got angry. How is he still alive? Better yet, how did he get to SC? That is when it hit me...WHERE IS G? We made arrangements to get Max back here and I started trying to get hold of Lindy Dunlap Bingham Terrell Kostek ???? (Not sure what the latest name is). When she returned my call finally...she wanted to tell me about her cancer that she was dying from. I just wanted to know where G was. She told me she didn't know Max wasn't dead and didn't know what happened to G. She said he was stolen. She said he was at her mother's. She told me he got loose and ran away. Her mother told me he got ran over. So for 5 years, I have cried, been sick to my stomach, become totally neurotic about how I place dogs, and developed a total distrust of people and my gut where people are concerned. So...Wednesday I turned my phone off while I went to the doctor. I then forgot to turn it back on until a friend showed up to get his dog and said he tried to call! When I turned it back on...I thought it was blowing up! I got Alyn Butterfield Dunn 's message first...call me about Gus! Then Mallory Bertrand message says ... call me or I am gonna blow your phone up. It is about G! I call Alyn and some strange chick answers the phone to tell me they have found G in Lebanon and she gave me an AC officer's phone #. Even after he confirmed the MICRO CHIP number...even after he went to the petfinder page for Gus and confirmed by the pictures that it was G...I just couldn't believe it. They told me they were closed on the 4th so I couldn't pick him up until Friday. Told me I had to bring proof that he belonged to me. So...those of you that really know me...well I don't do mornings...but I was up and letting some dogs out at 6:30 am. I was in Lebanon before AC officer got there. I still was numb and just could not believe it...5 years this month we had been looking for G...5 years he had been my profile picture. I said I would not change it until he was found. I have thought several times over the years that I needed to use that space for something else. Surely if he was going to be found, it would have happened before now. They told me he was slow moving and not very excited about any thing...the only thing the video blow is gonna show you...is excitement! I said his name...he looked at me...and then he was anything but slow! I am still crying...laughing...then crying somemore. I also have worries. I have no idea if he has had any shots, any hw preventatives, or any vetting. I am scared to death to see HW test. I really need some help with the funds but we will figure that out. Sometimes he will be across the yard and look up and see me. He wiggles and then runs to me. I am so happy and so relieved to find him alive. But people keep saying at least I got closure...well that is the part that kept me from posting about this...because I don't have closure. What happened to G? How did he get picked up stray in Lebanon? Having him here should be enough...but it isn't. I want every individual that lied, or knew something and didn't tell it, covered for her, told me you were helping but you were really trying to get me to back off...I want each and every one of you to be visited by Karma. I want you to be looking over your shoulder and wondering WHEN you will have that knock at the door...when I will figure out exactly what happened to this dog...especially if this boy pops heart worm positive. Thank you so much to those that have shared his posts, drove to homes in SC, Monroe County, Smith County, Sevier County and Wilson County to make sure he is not there. You will never know what that means to me. Now the question of the day...when can you see him? Once he has had his shots brought current and gets a clean bill of health...I will set something up. SECOND QUESTION seems to be whether I will keep him or rehome him. My belly hurts even thinking of handing him to someone else so we will have to wait on answering that. Welcome home G and thank you Jesus for keeping him safe! MICRO CHIP YOUR DOGS...\n\n(7/21/16) still no G... Lindy...the lying BITCH still tells all kinds of things about what happened. Who knows...I just know KARMA really needs to visit her on G's behalf. Here we are (11/12/2015) ...TWO years later and still no word on G...I think about him every day. Every time I am handing a dog over...I wonder...are these people really who they seem? Are they really gonna take care of this dog? My belly hurts, I am nauseous, my hands shake, and my heart hurts. If you know about G AKA Gus, please contact us. We need to see he is safe... Gus...I know you are out there. I pray that you are safe and loved...that you have a good and decent family that has no clue that we are looking for you...no clue that we are afraid for your safety...no clue that we are hurting because we miss you and do not know where you are. We love you and think about you daily. I continue to post this...on the pages of pet people, the pages of Lindy Dunlap Terrell Kostek and all of her family and friends, the pages for missing pets, the pages about needing justice, ...well I just keep posting your pictures...someone is gonna recognize you! As of May 21, 2015... Gus is still missing. We drove to Carthage, TN and spoke with Mike and Jama Dunlap - Lindy's parents. They fell all over themselves to be helpful. Said the dog had never been to their house and that they had no idea what happened to him. They said I should speak with Lindy's neighbors. The neighbors said there had never been a blue pit bull at Lindy's house. That would mean Gus never made it home that day! What happened to our boy?!!!??? We have been told every tale under the sun...and still Gus is missing. She won't tell us what she did with G...MAYBE she will tell you! SO...if you know or meet Mike or Jama Dunlap ( Carthage, TN Area) or Lindy Dunlap Bingham Terrell Kostek (living in Sevier County area and last known to be working at the Hatfield & Mc Coy's Dinner Theater in Pigeon Forge, TN) - why don't you tell them that East TN Pit Bull Rescue is still looking for this baby. Then why don't you ask them what happened to this dog!\n\nAs of September 14, 2014.... We have heard nothing of G's whereabouts. Lindy's MOTHER said the dog was 'stolen' just a few weeks after Lindy got him. That means he has been missing just over a YEAR! Still have been unable to locate husband Kevin Terrell to see if he has a clue what happened to him. We are not interested in yanking Gus from a loving home. We just want him safe. If you know ANYTHING about what happened to this dog, please contact us...here, email - etnpitbullrescue@gmail.com or call 8652022520... UPDATE!!!!!!!!! Just spoke with Lindy on the phone. She says G was stolen from her yard by a guy in a white F150 pick up just a few weeks back. The address there was 663 Lebanon HWY Carthage, TN 37030-2948. ( http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fusplaces.com%2Fothers%2Fcarthage-tn%2Funion-heights-elementary-school&h=eAQFL8xY8) She swears that she was told Max was dead ...Don't know what to believe BUT PLEASE....If you have contacts in the Carthage area....Share Gus! If you know rescue groups or folks at the shelters...PLEASE share! PLEASE look at these pictures and then SHARE them with everyone you know.! Gus was adopted by Lindy Terrell. She had previously adopted Max and he always looked great and happy. So I felt G would be safe and in a good home. I could not have been more wrong! Around the first week of June...they told me Max had GRIEVED himself to death when their grandfather died. At that time Max was living at 1924 Shiloh Church Rd in Seymour. Well on Wednesday...I received a phone call that STUNNED ME! The lady on the other end of the phone said...I believe I have your dog...Well in 7 yrs of doing this...I am thinking that could be any one of about 400...I said which dog/?...Max... Well we may have 4 Gracies and a couple of duplicated other names BUT there has only been ONE Max! I said NO WAY! HE DIED THIS PAST MAY!!!!! She says BIG brindle pit with largest head she has ever seen...Then she says...he has special mark...I said YES!!!! The white mark on the back of his neck under his collar! ... So Paula and I bond...I cry/I laugh/I cry...She sends pictures...SO we are so happy about Max and Sylvia Rainey Simpson is bringing him back to Knoxville when she returns from Greeneville, SC . AND THEN IT HITS ME....Where s GUS? They check the folks that had Max...Not there but lead me to family of Lindy Terrell...I said I have called and text her with no answer at this number 8656796966. East TN Pit Bull Rescue wants G back and SAFE! I will drive anywhere I have to to get him. No questions asked. Additionally...The family says she has no business adopting animals because she cannot keep a place to live. I know she adopted a small beagle mix from the McMinn County Humane Society. She does not have that pup with her either. When Max was adopted Lindy and her husband Kevin Terrell lived at 101 County RD 656 Athens, TN. They no longer live there. I tracked them to another address where they had a web site that said they boarded. They have moved from there. Then Lindy said she was living in Cookeville and coaching a college soft ball team. She said her mother lived in the area...Thru ALL of this Lindy refered to the cancer that ",

Every day is different with this girl; she's sweet and sassy, joyful and moody, loving and distant, independent and whiny, and incredibly smart! Kimba uses her astonishing intelligence to be very manipulative at times! She is very stubborn and will do whatever she can to get her way. This can be hilarious and adorable; however it is a behavior that needs to be worked on. She is also very possessive of her food and toys which, mixed with her stubbornness, can be a lot to handle. Kimba's ideal home would be one with a fenced in yard, few visitors and an owner who is willing to spend a lot of time training her! She absolutely cannot be homed with children or other animals. She requires somebody dedicated and willing to come up several times to learn how to train and handle her. Kimba is a real gem, and has just not been given a proper chance in life. If you are serious about putting the training into Kimba that she needs, then come meet her! Give this beautiful girl the home she should've had from the start!",

However, Lucy is a timid, young Beagle mix who went to school each day because she was slowly starving to death.... and the staff would feed her, give her treats and some attention each day. It broke their hearts that she appeared homeless so one of the teachers took her home so she would be cared for.  She is healthy now, weighing about 35 lbs. Unfortunately, her foster has not had the time to work with her nor has she an understanding of how to help her get ready for her forever home and family. She needs socializing. She prefers females to males. She needs someone who has the time and desire to help train her. Sweet Lucy has waited so long to be loved.  Lucy is praying for a forever home that can shower her with lots of love & attention, showing her there is nothing to be afraid of anymore and to be committed to helping her grow and happily thrive.  Are you the one who will show her how the world is supposed to be? She is a beautiful girl... please consider giving her the life she deserves.",

She was fostered until her babies were born and weaned. Her babies were then transported to a rescue. For whatever reason, Olive didn't get to go with her babies and was taken back to the shelter where she wound up on the EU list. I happened to see her picture late the night before she was to be Eu'd and knew that we couldn't let this beautiful little girl die. With the help of several amazing ladies, we were able to get Olive from Corpus Christi into our hands where she will get the treatment she needs and will never wind up in a shelter again! Thank you ladies for all your help! You know who you are. It never ceases to amaze me what can be accomplished when everyone works together with the welfare of dogs first in mind. Thank you EVERYONE who had a hand in saving this precious girl!\n",

He's a sweet boy who has lived his entire life on a chain.  We rescued Moose from a high kill shelter in NC.  He was found on the side of the highway looking for food and still had his chain hanging off of him.  Moose is a sweet boy who is very food driven and easy to train.  We have transitioned him from being an outdoor dog to living indoors.  His favorite hobbies are to stare out the window watching squirrels, napping on his bed (he doesn't get on human furniture) and going for his leash walk.  He glows when he's on his leash walks.  Moose needs an all adult home.  Moose needs to be placed in a single family home with a fully fenced in yard.  He has separation anxiety and food aggression.  Experienced dog owners only pls.  \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in this awesome boy, please email \n\nBreshkie@dogworldrescue.com\n\nOur adoption application is the first step in our adoption process.  Please check to make sure you are within our adoption area before applying.  We schedule meet and greets based on an initial match with our online application.  \n\nhttp://www.dogworldrescue.com/adopt/\n",

Each knows where the other is at all times.\n\nThey need to be adopted together.\n\nFoxy is 10 years old. She is sweet and kind. She loves her Goldie and they two dogs are great company.\n\nFoxy was born without a foot, it does not cause her any problems but if she were to do a lot of walks on a sidewalk or street, she should have a boot, which are available easily. This misshaped foot on her hind leg, the veterinarian said, was a result of the umbilical cord wrapped around it in utero.\n\nNothing can be done to help or correct it, it does cause any problems, she gets along fine. She goes up stairs and is a just like any other 4 footed friend. We say she has 3 1/2 feet,\n\nFoxy and Goldie do not cause any problems, they know the dog door, they are well house mannered, etc.\n\nBoth could be in an apartment.\n\nPlease give Foxy and Goldie a home\n\n\n\n\n\n602-316-8919 (no texts please)\n\n",

She gets along with all dogs and cats, but no toddlers for Ireland. She plays rough and just loves doing twirls and having zoomies. She takes time to warm up to people, but she's a really sweet girl once she feels comfortable. Formal training is required within 30 days of adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adding Ireland to your loving home, please complete an adoption application here: www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt",

Just wanna make sure it's safe ie: not a hoarding situation, a reasonable way to walk the doggy without throwing it on the highway, things like that) we do not adopt further than a reasonable driving distance (2.5 hours max).",

I love to go for walks\n\nor runs\n\n(and I am really good at it!). I also love car rides, stuffed animals, and playing in a fenced-in backyard. I am completely house trained,\n\ncrate trained\n\n,\n\nand am very intelligent. I know what sit,\n\nlay down\n\n,\n\nand stay mean, but I could use some more training to work on those commands and anything else you want to teach me. I love to run and play; I have a whole lot of energy, but I also love to cuddle, give kisses and be loved by my human companion\n\n.\n\nBasically, I just like to be doing what my people are.\n\nI am very cautious of new people. I really prefer to come check you out first, and I really rather you don't pet me until I know you will treat me with kindness.\n\nI may\n\nhave to meet you a couple times before\n\nI know I can trust you\n\n.\n\nI can't tell my friends at Last Hope what happened to me before I came to stay with them, but all they know is that it takes me a while to trust people and be comfortable in situations. Because of this, I should not be in a home with young kids or teens.\n\nMy dream home would be with an adult family who is familiar with my kind of challenges and who has a physically fenced in yard. I also want 1 other playful dog around my size (50 pounds+) or bigger\n\nto play with (I can play a little rough so they need to be tough like me) and a family who is very patient with me while I adjust to new people in my life.\n\nI am a very loyal companion and I just want to please my humans!\n\nOnce I know I can trust you, I just want to be around you and will be your shadow as you go through your day.\n\nI have also had my DNA tested! I am officially an Australian Cattle Dog/Harrier mix!\n\nLast Hope requires that all pets be kept as indoor pets, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and vet checks and a home visit. The adoption fee includes: spay/neuter, microchip and vaccinations.",

His most dominant breeds found were; Australian Cattle Dog, American Staffordshire Terrier and Curly-Coated Retriever! Don't you just love that face! He does great in the car and loves to explore and go on outings to the park. He loves going for walks and after the walk he would be your couch potato buddy! Biscoe would love a yard he could lay around in and sun bath! He would do best in a quiet home with low foot traffic. Biscoe has called the adoption center his home for a few years and takes time to warm up to people but once he knows and loves you he will love you for life!\n\nIf you are interested in Biscoe we ask you to become a volunteer at Last Hope Adoption Center.\n\nBiscoe's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations as well as a basic obedience class at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, altered, current on vaccinations and preventatives.

I am missing some hair on my back end, it happen Egypt and we don't know what happened but could be the reason it takes time for Barclay to warm up to new people. I am all healed up and would love home with understanding people. I would do best in a quiet home with my few people that understand and love me. I will need on going care for my skin so I don't get sores. The volunteers keep my skin nice and moisturized and away from the sun so I don't get sun burns. I know lots of commands, sit, down, shake and I am crate trained. I love to play with toys too! I like playing with other dogs but I need a home with no kids. Everyone says I am a very handsome boy.\n\nIf you are interested in Barclay we ask you to become a volunteers at the Last Hope Adoption Center so he can get to know you! Barclay has stranger danger and takes time to warm up to new people.\n\nBarclay will need an owner who has previous experience with dogs who have behavioral issues.\n\nBarcaly's adoption free is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations as well as a basic obedience class at Cedar Run in Hiawatha.

I am Catahoula Leopard Dog, American Staffordshire Terrier, Lab and Siberian Husky! I'm an energetic gal for my age and love exploring and smelling new places. I do have arthritis and an old ACL tear that was replaced but I don't let that stop me from being out and about but some days it slows me down. Squeaky toys are my all time favorite toy! I love to carry toys around in my mouth, it is my thing! I love the water and playing in the kiddie pool! If you like water and beaches I might be the gal for you! I need a home with no other animals. I like to be Queen Bee! I am a very smart girl! If you are interested in Clover, we ask you to become a volunteers at Last Hope Adoption Center to get to know her! At first I do have stranger danger but I do worm up!\n\nClover's adoption fee is $250 includes her spay and microchip current vaccinations as well as a basic obedience class at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires all animals be kept indoors pets only altered currently on vaccinations and provide preventative year round. Adoption process includes references and background check of that check and home visit.\n\n2/2/21 4:51 PM",

If you'd like to sponsor Snuffles by donating towards his care and medications, that can be done through our website, and your donations are tax deductible.  Here's the link:\n\nwww.lowermainlandhumanesociety.org\n\n\nSnuffles was born in 2005 and was surrendered in 2017, after his owner fell ill and could not longer take care of him.  He is a sweet old man, but he does have grumpy moments.\n\n\nSnuffles has been diagnosed with dry eye conjunctivitis and requires cyclosporine drops 2 x a day ongoing.  Unfortunately he doesn't enjoy receiving these drops and can be very difficult about it. \n\nSnuffles is totally house broken. Because of his age, he has the old man bumps on his back and some on his face.   Doesn't cause much trouble, and we were advised by the vet that the bumps on his eyes do not cause him any vision troubles, and do not have to be removed. \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in sponsoring Snuffles, please go to our website to donate.\n\nhttp://www.dhanamettarescuesociety.org\n\n",

Sasha is very healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped, de-wormed, heartworm-tested and on monthly heartworm preventative. \n\n If you are interested in meeting and possibly adopting this lovely girl, please contact melia88@comcast.net or 708-224-1900.

PLEASE FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, ONCE APPROVED, GIVE US A CALL AND WE CAN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO MEET ME!\n\nI am 2 years old, 63 pounds and I'm great with other dogs.\n\nAdoption Donation: $300\n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus; Vectra 3D.\n\nAll household members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available.  As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nHere is the link to the Adoption Application: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\n \nThank you!\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley IL, 60142\nwww.animalhouseshelter.com\n\nOpen \nSunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM, \nTuesday from 11 am to 4 pm and \nSaturday's 9 AM to 7 PM. \n847-961-5541\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nConnect With Us:\n\"Like\" Us On Facebook!\nWatch Us On YouTube!\nFollow Us On Twitter! \n\nAdoption Application: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nHow to Adopt: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/",

Charles is neutered, current on vaccinations and heartworm preventative.  Charles appears to be good with indoor cats however, will chase cats relentlessly if outdoors.  He would be best in a home with no cats, or a home where any cats are strictly indoors, \n\nWith the Covid-19 situation, FURS has temporarily stopped our weekly adoption stands.  We can make alternate arrangements for meeting the FURS dogs but would require an approved application for adoption.  There is no fee or obligation with submitting an adoption application and applications can be completed on line at www.fursdogs.com\n\nA required step of our adoption process is to conduct a home visit.  Since FURS is a very small, all-volunteer rescue, we can only support our adoption process to homes in the Richmond, VA and surrounding localities area",

He may do a little growl as well but usually warms up with a treat and letting him come to you on his own.\n\nWe don\u2019t know a lot about his past. We were told he was given up to a shelter because the owner could no longer take care of him. Kojo has met new people while at Briggs and has been fine around them, even sitting on the futon with people quietly.\n\nOne thing that we\u2019ve recently found out about Kojo is that he becomes very bonded to his human companion(s) and then becomes protective of them by getting in between and trying to snap at a person who hugs his human companion.\n\nFor this reason, Kojo is considered a \u201cSpecial Needs\u201d dog. He should not be around children or cats. Kojo\u2019s best home would be with a single person who does not have visitors. This way, he can just hang around with and provide companionship for that person. Kojo just wants to be with his human companion and challenges anyone who shares his space with that loved one.\n\nKojo is responsive to verbal correction, if he realizes that he cannot get away with his challenges. So it\u2019s imperative that his new owner establishes with Kojo that it is not acceptable to be so protective. That can usually be accomplished by an immediate, strong verbal wording and a \u201ctime-out\u201d.\n\nKojo is middle-aged so he would be best with someone who may also be middle-aged so they can just \u201chang out\u201d together.\n",

The only thing is, is that she can not be adopted to a family with other dogs, she must be the only dog, as in the past she has had issues with other pups. She does not get along well with other dogs but is a very gentle dog otherwise.   She would prefer a home with no small children. \nIf you are looking for a calm, well mannered dog that wants to spend time with you and lay beside you she would be perfect.  She does not even bark much or shed much.\n\nShe would be perfect for a retired couple or individual. She is extremely quite and does not bark much and she would even do well in an apartment or small house as long as she can lounge on a couch with her favorite person :)) Will you give Her a chance to be your loyal friend? She will give you all the love she has and she is a true princess! She walks well on a leash.  She is so loving and is wanting her fur ever home and has been waiting for quite some time.  Don't let her breed or age deter you, she is a loving companion .  We always take the fur babies back into our care if for any reason it does not work out.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE FOR ROXIE IF YOU LIVE OUT OF STATE TRANSPORTATION TO YOUR LOCATION IS AVAILABLE WITH AN APPROVED HOME STUDY/APPLICATION.  PLEASE INQUIRE IF INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT MORE AND WE CAN CONTACT PET TRANSPORTERS TO GET A QUOTE FOR YOU.",

ACAP took them in their program to find them a home.\n\nShe is a good running dog.\n\nShe is friendly and loves to play with other dogs. \n\n She needs an active family\n\nUPDATE December 10, 2019 Sadie is about 3 years old and weighs 82 pounds.\n\nUPDATE: a DNA test was done on Sadie's sister with these results: 25% blood hound. 12.5 % am staffordshire terrier 12.5. % German Shepherd and the other 50% is Alaskan malamute austrailan cattle dog basset hound and Boston terrier.

So I sat down to write this post for the nice people at HOPE, because that's the kind of thing they do - find nice people for extremely intelligent and lovable furbabies. I shudder to type this, but I'm LAPLESS! That's right, I have no human lap to call my own. Could you be persuaded to volunteer yours? I can't wait to see my forever home!'\nVenus is an active and incredibly smart girl who likes nothing more than to stretch her legs at the beach or at the park. She'd suit an active person who wants an outgoing and friendly companion - if you can lob a tennis ball, Venus will be your friend for life! She would like to be the only pet in her new home.\nIf you are interested in Venus and would like to fill out a Dog Adoption Application, please go to: http://www.homelesspets.net/adoption-forms/dog-adoption.php . Submitting an application does not obligate you to adopt from us but it initiates contact with us and gets the process started. If you have questions prior to filling out the application, email us at HOPEDogCommittee@groups.io and a volunteer will get back to you.",

Turtle has many skills that will make her new career as an adopted pooch a breeze! For example, she has plenty of playgroup experience, and she excels at long leisurely walks. However, she also enjoys just sitting in the yard bird watching or watching the squirrels playing in the trees. She also has wonderful people skills.\nTurtle's specialties are snuggling, smiling and making human hearts grow three sizes. Turtle's favorite past time is just lying on the couch with her human, watching TV. Can you help Turtle start her new career as an adopted member of your loving family?\nIf you are interested in Turtle and would like to fill out a Dog Adoption Application, please go to: http://www.homelesspets.net/adoption-forms/dog-adoption.php . Submitting an application does not obligate you to adopt from us but it initiates contact with us and gets the process started. If you have questions prior to filling out the application, email us at HOPEDogCommittee@groups.io and a volunteer will get back to you.",

Sissy just loves affection, attention and some good old doggy treats and cookies. She'll practically do anything for something to eat! Sissy is a bit timid when meeting new people and due to the fact she's had some eye surgeries some decreased vision in her right eye makes her a bit unsure in some instances. All she's getting now is eye meds every day since the biggest issue is dry eye and repeated entropion surgeries. Sadly they may have made her syptoms worse. But it really doesn't stop her. Sissy loves kids other dogs and playing in the hose and wading pool during the summer! She also loves to take hikes to the creek and wade through the clear, moving water watching the fish! She's excellent for her baths, ear cleanings, nail trims and getting her eye meds put in. I think she knows when I do that her eyes feel better. In a perfect world I'd like to Sissy get adopted togeter with her sister Queen. Or at least go to a family with another dog so she has that companionship.\nADDITIONAL MEDICAL CARE:\nSissy may require eye drops daily as a result of the eye surgery she had:\nEntropion is the inward curling of the eyelid so that the lashes scratch the cornea and cause irritation and eventual scarring and ulceration. It occurs when the eyeball is too small for the socket and the lids roll in toward the eye. 1/14/21 5:26 PM",

You see, Ash just LOVES his people. He is not high energy, his foster says he is a couch potato.\n\nUnfortunately, Ash is a victim of hurricane Harvey now. Multiple people in his family lost their homes and Ash is also part of that loss. Ash is a small to medium size boy, about 40lbs and fully vetted, neutered and house trained.\n\nAsh has developed Masticatory Myotisis which is a big word for basically, lost some muscle tone. He had a huge head, and now his head is a little smaller. The vets say this was caught soon enough and is under control. And is kept at bay with a small dose of prednisone. And other than a \"normal sized head\" there are no other effects that Ash is showing. Please do not let that stop you from adopting Ash. We'd be happy to talk with you about this!\n\nVisit www.scoutshonor.org and complete an application today if you can give Ash his forever home.",

She was rescued from one of the Los Angeles City Animal Shelters just in time.  She was slated for death because they claimed she was still on medication, which in fact she no longer was!  \n\nAlice now receives cold laser treatment to her various joints every week which has enabled her to move about well and be able to walk smoothly without the pain that she had before.  Her treatment has also shrunk the swelling on her ankle joints.  Her remaining eye is now very healthy and she can see out of it very well.  For Alice's supporters we can provide the name of Alice's veterinarians and copies of all her vet bills.\n\nTo meet and sponsor Alice, please contact:   theanimalsleftbehind@socal.rr.com  (also our Paypal donation/sponsorship email address)",

He is a special needs dogTheo is a gorgeous Brindle boy with a flash of white on his chest and a black face that just screams to be kissed. Theo is a confident boy who loves to play in the yard with his siblings, or play tug with his siblings. At the end of the day, before we go to bed, he has to have a snuggle with mom on the couch. As adorable as this boy is, he will be happiest with a sedate household that just want an adorable loving guy to snuggle with. He will not be a running companion, nor will he do well with lots of stairs. But Theo loves to go in the car and slow walks around the neighborhood.\nTheo is anxious to learn and will be an awesome family member. He is best suited to a family with a yard. He has grown up with chiuahuah's and larger dogs and is a very compassionate guy who plays gently with his friend who is special needs. He was a bottle baby and has only known love and affection. Theo has a depth perception problem so doesnt like to do stairs or cross over colors that he isnt familiar with. Like on walkway crossings.\nTheo had a genetic defect and both of his back knees have had TPLO surgery to correct. His right ankle fluxates, but there is nothing to be done with it.\nThis young man is perfect. He loves to cuddle and lives his treats. Theo has the sweetest purring sound when he is playing with the other dogs. He sounds like a bull horn when he gets nervous. I cant imagine anyone could love this boy more than I do, but he is available for adoption to the right family who can care and love him.\nPlease contact info@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online at www.aarfhouston.org/forms . Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet. Thank you for considering a rescue!

            "description": "Ladies, are you looking for a new BFF who will never let you down?  Meet Meg, a four year old female Terrier/Beagle-mix with a spunky personality.  Meg is a stocky little spitfire who weighs around 30 pounds.  Shh! Don\u2019t tell her, but she is a little on the pudgy side.  She loves women and becomes very attached to her person.  Meg would do best in an adult home where she can always be by your side.  She has good house manners and is completely housebroken.  One of her favorite things is going on long walks.  Meg is all smiles and wiggles the moment she sees the leash.  Though exuberant at first, she quickly calms down and is a dream to walk.  Meg enjoys her time playing outside at the shelter with her doggie friends.  A calm, submissive dog would be a good companion for her.  A fenced in yard will be needed to make sure she is safe from wandering.  Meg will be a faithful companion who only asks for love in return.  Please give this chunky monkey girl the second chance she truly deserves.  To adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

She was brought in as an epileptic alert service dog and went through six months of work towards becoming certified. She's fully crate trained, knows many commands, leash trained, fantastic with children of all ages, loving, and an absolute champ at cuddling. Dove does need to be an only dog, however. She was the victim of some pretty serious abuse when she was a puppy and now sees other dogs as a threat to her life. She needs to be in a home where she can love and play and be the wonderful girl we know her to be without having to fear that she'll be attacked by other animals. Dove would do so well as a family girl, or a hiking companion, or a fellow couch potato (she loves watching baseball games). She would fit in any place that can allow her to be the only pet. Please contact us at 520-977-8000 or 520-406-7533 or fill out an adoption applications at smilingdogrescue.com\n\n",

Almost 3 years later (1,018 days), Shady is still with us. We are just as baffled as you.\n\nShady must be the only pet in his new home, but he LOVES kids, he would love to have some human kids of his own. Shady loves snuggling, taking baths (especially if they have bubbles), giving kisses, & watching any cartoon movies with dogs...his favorite is The Secret Life of Pets. He will do best in a home with a 6ft privacy fence & kids aged 8+. He is 5 years young, neutered & fully vaccinated.\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nOnline Adoption Application \nHansel is a sweet boy who has come far from the day that he was surrendered to our care. He loves going for walks in wooded areas, rolling in the grass, and swimming in little pools or lakes. This loving dog is great with all animals big or small. Morning time is Hansel's favorite time of the day. As soon as he wakes up he seeks out cuddles and genuinely looks forward to saying 'good morning' to you. Going for a trip to the dog park and getting lots of treats are the makings of a perfect day for this little man. Hansel is particularly fond of toys that squeak and always sniffs out spare slippers and socks to snuggle in bed with (yes he really cuddles with them). He loves sun naps and drags all his toys outside to take naps with him. This dog would be perfect for an outdoor enthusiast who is looking to add another dog to the family. Hansel will sleep all day if you let him, but when you bring him outside he unleashes all kinds of energy and joy. Due to the the world he grew up in, Hansel requires a week or two of patience for him to come out of his shell and show his true personality. He grows quite attached to whoever he bonds with. New environments are stressful for him but he adapts with praise and consistency. Hansel looks to other dogs in the home for guidance and confidence so having a doggie sibling or two in his adoptive home would be ideal. A calm and loving home will be best for our buddy but we think he'll do ok with older, quieter children too. Hansel is very attentive to his human's emotions and body language and would be an awesome addition to your family!",

Peanut loves to go out on his long walks, and when he returns will play in the play yard with his favorite rope toy or fetch a tennis ball for you. When he wants you to pet him he will gently raise his paw for you, or back up into you for a quick rub on the back. He loves his special time with the volunteers, and just imagine how he would feel having special time with his forever person/s. Peanut is a big boy and probably too much for children, but if you love to walk, play fetch and want a buddy to do it with, Peanut would love for you to come and meet him. \n\n*Peanut is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Peanut, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Peanut, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Peanut, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

He is well behaved and loves to play.\n\nFrankie was rescued from certain death after he was seized by police due to cruelty charges.  Even after being treated so badly he is loving and sweet.  \n\nNow he needs a good caring owner to teach him good manners and let him live a happy life.\n\nFrankie's adoption fee is $100!",

I was diagnosed with diabetes and need 2 shots of insulin daily and must be on a special \"homemade\" diet. Regardless of my condition, I'm a VERY SPECIAL little girl. I'm super sweet and lively and have a perky fun loving personality. I'm very affectionate and love to snuggle next to you on the couch. I'm nervous around young kids so an ADULT ONLY home is best for me  where I can get full TLC.  I am ok with other dogs and have lived with another dog & cat; but I would prefer to be a SOLO DOG.  I'm nervous with new dogs on the street at first so I can be a little vocal but once I get to know the dog I'm fine so a QUIET HOME in the suburbs would be preferable as opposed to an apt in the city.  I'm a typical chihuahua in that I will \"alarm bark\" and let you know if there someone in the hallway or at the door. In the house I love to hang out on the couch or snuggle in bed and I like to sleep in late! I'm a GEM OF DOG!! Please come meet me today!\n\nFor more info/app; please email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

He has this little prance he does when he's happy and playing. He loves his foster families kids! He tucks them in every night. He LOVES to play! Especially with balls, stuffed squirrel, his nerf toy frisbee and rope. He loves chewing on his nylabone. He kennels well and has his bone when he's in his kennel. He knows wait, leave it and sit.  He will need more training to continue to work on his manners. He just needs some treats with his training since he is very food motivated. He is not food aggressive at all. His personality is really starting to come out. He's so sweet, snuggly and funny. He's really excited when he's let out of his kennel, he's playful but mostly calm. He is very interested in the cat owned by his fosters and he has chased him. He may be fine with cats it will just depend on the cat. He does well on a leash with his harness. He does well in the car. He doesn't like going to the vet, he's very nervous but does well during the exam.",

This girl spent a majority of her young life on her own fending for herself without much socialization. Lila is learning to trust humans. She is an absolute treasure!! Sweet disposition, shy and very well behaved. Crate trained/ house trained beautiful manners. Lila MUST have another dog in the family. She is playful and happiest with canine companions. She truly is a pack dog and gains confidence surrounded by others. Good with all sizes, breeds. Lila has bonded with her foster sister Missy and would do well if they could be adopted together. She needs to have a very patient owner who will allow her to take her time building trust and seeking out affection on her own terms. She is a very low maintenance dog. Must have a fenced backyard. She loves to play with other dogs and she loves her crate for her quiet time and her own space. Lila has been spayed. I\n\nf you would like to learn more about Lila and are interested in adopting her, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "\nStitch prefers to spend her days quietly curating her tennis ball collection.  To this mellow 7-year old lab/shepherd mix girl, tennis balls = life.   She loves everything about them: their perfect shape, their chewy, nubby texture, the way they fly through the air like neon orbs of happiness, the way you can almost fit 3 in your mouth at once, with some concentration.  Stitch is living with a foster family right now and has settled into an easy, relaxed routine.   They adore her company.   Her foster mom says she\u2019s so mellow and low-maintenance.  She does very well on her own at home, but Stitch also enjoys being close to you when you are around.  Her foster mom says Stitch will quietly follow you from room to room,  but she is never pushy or too much.  She will wait for you to ask her to jump up on the couch.  If you would prefer the couch to yourself, that is okay with her, too.   She thrives on the routine of living in a home with her people.   That is her true happy place.  The only time she gets a little nervous is when she goes outside into the world and gets thrown off her game \u2014 by strangers, noise, etc.  So, while she loves exercise and play, Stitch is more of a homebody, who prefers to focus her adventures on the backyard she knows, minus the long walks in strange new places she doesn\u2019t know. She would do best in a home without young children.",

What a coincidence, so is Julio!\n\nJulio came to us after being mishandled for much of the first year of his life. He was clearly stressed and traumatized, but bounced back quickly with some Friends For Life TLC. With gentle training techniques, he is learning to feel confident with different people and situations.\n\nWith every day that Julio spends at FFL, we love him more and more, and this is why:\n-Julio is a canine genius! It only takes one repetition for him to learn a new trick. He knows how to sit, lie down, go to his mat, make eye contact, and come when called.\n-Julio is easy to please! He not only works for treats, but he will perform his trained behaviors for toys, a chance to put his leash on, or for you to open the door for him.\n-Julio is so much fun! He can chase toys all days for you and, even better, he\u2019ll bring them back and relinquish them to your hand automatically, no commands needed!\n-Julio does like an occasional massage and belly rub, but he\u2019s not clingy. He\u2019d much rather play than cuddle.\n\nJulio is a bright, enthusiastic, and tenacious guy who could be your ideal activity partner \u2013 if you wouldn\u2019t mind hanging with a dog who may just be smarter than you!",

A true gentleman to add to your family or as a companion for yourself. Easy.\n He was turned into Moreno Valley shelter as the folks had no time and money to care for the two dogs. \nHis little friend is named Rey, who was shy and young but does well with Rocker at his side. They are great friends.\n  He is sweet, kind, a warm personality. He obviously lived in a loving home as an indoor dog with his male companion. His markings are stunning and a real eye catcher. He would love to see the world, go hiking, camping, to the beach and have a great life with a FOREVER loving family!   He is an American Bulldog mix. Very large but gentle. You can see this in his eyes in the pictures. He is very willing to please and easy for a good handler to walk on a leash.\nplease fill out an application at www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org and you can see our other great dogs up for adoption.\nHe is micro chipped, neutered, up to date on his shots.",

I was given to a homeless couple who could not care for me.  Luckily they were able to give me to a friend of theirs, Sherrille who has a rescue group.  Being a stray, I am not sure what breed(s) I am.  I am thinking  maybe Lab and Pointer Mixes.  Sherrille is fostering me and tells me that I am so smart for such a young girl no matter what I am.  I love sleeping in my crate and running around the play yard playing with my new friends.  So far I have managed to have good house manners.\n   I would really like a family or human of my own.  A family or human who can give me attention, petting, play time, teach me the ropes, have patience with me and maybe enroll me in an Obedience and Behavioral Class, because I have so much energy I would love to go on long walks or hiking in the mountains would be awesome.\n\nMy adoption fee is $150.00.\n\nIf you think you could be that family or human, please text or call Sherrille @ 281-706-0242 or Penny @ 713-824-2737 or email @ pennykbryce@gmail.com\n\nI will be looking forward to meeting you soon!",

Found as a stray in SLO county this little guy ended up at the bottom of the list of wanted dogs when the shelter filled up and his age did him in,  12 is a guess but Boston is full of nice energy and may be younger.  He is really cute.  Great with dogs and cats and house trained.  He makes funny sounds and is pretty talkative.  Really cute in real life and rather a character. Funny little guy\n",

This handsome boy sadly finds himself without a home once again because his adopter dumped him. Thor is about 50 pounds now. He isn't a fan of being home alone all day, and would do best in a calm, structured home in a quiet location with a patient owner and companion dogs to help him continue to build his confidence. He knows his basic commands like 'sit' and 'stay'. Thor can be timid around new people, but is very sweet when he learns to trust. He is agile and can jump a fence, so a lead when with him in the yard is a must. If you are interested in adopting Thor (aka Jermaine), please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Marshall County Humane Society is now following CDC guidelines for Covid-19 in order to keep everyone as safe as possible. We are showing dogs and cats to prospective adopters, but only on the grounds outside our shelter. We will need appointment to show the animal and we will want to have social distancing of 6' while you are there and we are wearing masks. We are doing Zoom interviews to see inside of your home since we aren't going into homes for home visit. We do come to your home before finalizing adoption to check the security of your fence if you are adopting a dog. Our dogs are given much care and attention and we treat every medical need of animal once we take them in.\nMCHS is a limited intake adoption center. We are an all volunteer, non-profit organization. All of our animals are disease free, have been spayed/neutered and are up to date on shots. We charge a Dog adoption fee of $125 which includes a microchip. Our Cat adoption fee is $75.00. Most of our dogs will require a fenced yard. To fill out application, go to our website Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org, go to Adoption Info tab and click on Application. For more info, call 662-564-2900. I'M TOOTSIE AND I'M AN ADDICT.\nWhen I see cats I go after them. Do you think I need to go to therapy? The volunteers at the shelter where I live say I'm the very best dog. I housetrained myself and I get along well with all the other dogs and I love being with people. I'm trying to understand why everyone who has wanted to adopt me has a cat; when they hear about my problem, they don't want me any more. Is there anyone out there who wants a gentle friendly girl that doesn't love cats?\nAll Marshall County Humane Society animals have been spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots and vaccinations, plus flea and heartworm preventatives. For complete list of our adoptable animals, or online applications, see Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org. For more information call Humane Society at 662-564-2900 or email Dogsncats11@gmail.com.\nIf you are interested in her, plz go to website; http://marshallcountyhumanesociety.org and go to tab 'Adoption Info' and click on 'Application.'\n\n1/24/21 4:58 PM",

            "description": "Sweet Lindy was a pregnant and homeless girl in GA who had no one. A nice family took her in and took care of her while she gave birth to her four puppies. She was a very good momma. Soon her puppies were all adopted out down in GA and then the family had to move and couldn\u2019t take her - and Lindy had nowhere to go. It was looking like she would have to go to a high kill shelter in GA (owner surrenders are killed first). A Hamburg Mutts volunteer heard her story and knew she couldn\u2019t let that happen. Thankfully, Lindy came to Buffalo and she is such a love \u2013 and a character. She gets the \u201czoomies\u201d and runs around the yard so we feel she needs a fenced yard for her to zoom in. She loves to be with people, cuddling on the couch. She has the cutest little snore and makes the funniest little Chewbacca sound when she yawns!!\n\nLindy is smallish \u2013 she is 17\u201d tall at the shoulder, and weighs 40 pounds. She is About 5 years old. . She is house trained, crate trained, knows basic commands, and walks well on leash with a Liberty Harness. She knows \u201cleave it\u201d for the squirrels & rabbits she wants to chase. She has a high prey drive so probably a house with no cats is best. She can live with other dogs, but slow introductions are best and she needs to be with a calm, balanced doggy like her current foster sister. Lindy is great with children, but we think older children would be best because if she were to have an energy burst, we wouldn\u2019t want a little one to get knocked over by accident.\n\nLindy is currently working with a trainer, and her lessons can continue with this trainer with no cost to her adopter!! If you would like to make this sweet girl a member of your family please email hamburgmutts@gmail.com.\n\n",

I love to play play play. I love playing with other dogs. I am obedient, house-trained and crate-trained. I pack-walk off-leash and I stay with my pack! I walk nicely on leash with a easy-walk harness. I am 13+ years old. I'm in perfect health. When I get the \"play\" out of my system, I sleep like a born couch-potato! In other words, I am the perfect dog for an active person or a family with an active person. I require a fenced yard. If I am not an only dog, I must dine at a table for one. So no matter how much I might love my doggy roommates, I want to dine alone. I had an eye removed in the end of 2019. I prefer no surprises on the right side of my body. Speaking before approaching on the right is a good idea so that I'll turn my head and see you. I am charming and a lover. I love back scratches and I'm a world-class kisser. I don't do cats.\n\nUnfortunately, I no longer match my profile from three years ago. Yes, there has not been ONE adoption interest in me in three years. I recently suffered two strokes. I am weak on my right side but I am independent and I still like to play! My cognition is not what it used to be either. I am slower in responding, and I am slow to eat, so my foster mom feeds me by hand. I continue to be house-trained with a doggy door, so my brain injury has not affected my indoor manners.Adoption fees are $200 unless otherwise stated. Senior residents of Dot's Old Dogs Home are generally not available for adoption. 100% of adoption fees are put back into the rescue so that another lonely and neglected chained/penned dog or yard-sale dog can be rescued. We are grateful for your interest.\n\nUpon approval, the adoption fee is non-refundable. The fee includes the following: de-worming; grooming (if applicable); heartworm, lymes, ehrlichia and anaplasmosis testing; all vaccinations including rabies; flea and tick treatment, microchipping and spay/neuter.\n\nPlease contact us if you have questions about our adoptable dogs, we would love to talk to you!\n1/16/21 1:28 PM",

People have come to meet me but I have a hard time containing my excitement. When I jump up and wanna play tug with their coats they seem to get a little upset. I will work on that. Will you work on it with me. I have been to training class so I know how to behave but I seem to need lots of reminders. My excitement seems to override my common sense sometimes. I love love love love to play especially with tug toys and sticks. Oh sticks, I love small ones, big ones, ones that I can barely carry... oh sticks. I do like playing with some of the dogs here at the Sanctuary but they are the ones that follow my rules and let me be in charge. I am only a couple years old and have spend about half that here at the Sanctuary. Before then I was abandoned in a trailer with no food or water with my litter of puppies. Thank goodness I was rescued and all my pups found forever homes. So thats my story. I hope that someone somewhere will realize that I am the dog for them. Just go to www.libertyacresunited.com and submit an application to adopt me.",

            "description": "Spuds is a long legged lemon beagle/lab mix, 4 years old and 40-45 lbs. He's got a stubbed tail - shelter thought he had some cocker spaniel in him - we don't see it. He has developed some great friendships with other B&B dogs - might help if he was adopted with one of those companions.\nVery selective of his people - not good with strangers. He will bite. But with the right people, he's a good boy- friendly, loves cuddles, mingles well with other dogs, runs around the yard, and follows his people obediently. Does well on a leash.\nHere's how he likes to learn to trust: Someone come very frequently and spend 15+ minutes with him - less in the beginning. Check in with him - go volunteer with another dog or other task - and then back to him. Repeat this often and until he is happy to see you. That is how he learned to LOVE us here.\nWe rescue a fair number of very shy, unsocialized dogs - they can heal - if we, the people, don't mess it up. We use the help of a terrific trainer/dog whisperer - terristeuben.com\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

They call me Sissy because I am a really good sister to my canine foster sisters.\n\nI really LOVE to gallop into the kitchen ahead of the human when it is time for breakfast or dinner! My foster mom is patient with me when I poke my head in the fridge to make suggestions on what she should put in my bowl. I like it when me and my foster sisters are finished with our meal and it is time for biscuits. We sit patiently and then catch our treats in our mouths!\n\nMy tail wags all the time. In fact, it wags so much that sometimes when it hits against the wall or couch, I think someone is behind me and take a look!\n\nMy foster sisters and I have figured out who is in charge of what in the house. When there is a cat in the backyard or when someone comes to the front door, I am the first one to sound the alarm! My foster mom had one of her friends bring over her small dogs to see how I would react to them. At first I was very curious about them, but after a while they were the ones following me.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a cuddler, but I like it when humans pet me and give me hugs and kisses. When that is all over, I just go and lay down in one of my favorite spots in the house. I love to lay on couches because they are soft and comfortable for my older bones. I really like to be around humans, but I sleep by myself at night so I can guard the house.\n\nI am spayed, microchipped, and vaccinated and available for adoption in the Los Angeles area. I am house-trained and know commands like sit and stay, and I really want a home I can call my own. Is it your home?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sissy, please fill out our application form online at www.jasonheigl.foundation/adopt/sissy. Contact us at info@jasonheigl.foundation",

We would suggest older kids because he still plays too much with his mouth to go with very little ones.\nRanger needs a quiet home with less stimulations so that he can be the little chill guy that he wants to be.",

            "description": "Our darling, smiling Daisy is now a senior. Her favorite activity, adoption day, was canceled for 2020. She was a socialite at adoption events. She is doing well in foster care. She likes most dogs and is ok around two of our dogs but does not tolerate being around our blue tick coonhound. Daisy is not the kind of dog who ever wanted to cuddle on the couch--she is content to be in the room sleeping on the floor or in a different room as long as she knows you are nearby. She has arthritic pain in her hind legs, but has medication. She has separation anxiety and would need a home where there are other dogs or humans at all times, but would do best with older children and adults.\n\nCheck out her video!Accuracy is not guaranteed; however, information provided is accurate to the best of our knowledge.\n\nFor more information on the pet, please send an email to info@aforeverhome.org\n2/2/21 6:21 PM",

            "description": "Another perfect pup, victim of Hurricane Maria, from Puerto Rico,.Ziggy is roughly 6 years old. He was a Sato rescue from post hurricane Maria Puerto Rico.  He is a gorgeous black and white pup who looks to be part border collie. His fur is silky and soft and he sheds but BARELY.\n\nHe likes to chill at home with his family. He is utd on all medical and in good health. \nHe likes walks and being outdoors to romp but doesn\u2019t necessarily require an active (working breed) lifestyle.\n\nZiggy knows:\nSit\nStay\nCome\nPaw\nOther paw\nLeave it \nTake it \nHe is trained to use a doggy door.\n\nHe is easygoing most of the time, even when playfully roughhousing he can be trusted to be careful. \nLoves belly rubs. \nHe loves to be able to park himself where he can look at a window. \nKnows the term \u201ctreat\u201d which we generally use to refer to Greenies. \nFAVE TREAT: LOVES CHALLAH BREAD \nWill gladly take meds and supplements if they are wrapped in a dab of cream cheese and a little piece of American cheese to conceal. \n \n ONLY EXP Owner for this purrfect pup--UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS\nZiggy can be reactive due to fear aggression (we believe this to be a resulting of having had to survive on the street). His triggers are predominately food based. \nHe can be very inconsistent around other dogs. When you walk him always be aware that he could seem at ease and accepting, and then suddenly react. \n \nWhile he is acclimating to his new home be aware of the following:\nMake sure he is aware and see if you\u2019re approaching so as not to startle him.\nApproaching from the front and make sure he sees your hand coming before you touch him. \nBe hyper aware when there is food involved. Don\u2019t approach him when he is eating from his bowl, he will react.\nIf he is sitting nearby when you are snacking or if you are giving him a treat, if he perceives someone is trying to take it from him, even in correctly, he will react. Always remember that he grew up on the street and had to fight off other animals for his food. \nUnfortunately, as a result, we believe Ziggy has some sort of PTSD. He is a very good gentle and loving boy, but if he perceives a threat, even if it is not actual, his first impulse will be to go on the offensive. \n \nIn my home, he is a accustomed to being allowed on the furniture and on the bed, but can easily be retrained to stop that with reinforcement. We have him trained to sleep at the foot of our bed, where we give him his own little pillow. \n \nZiggy will do best in a home where he is the only pet and there are no small children.  He is a working dog and is bored doing nothing...(aren't we all?)\n\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted here)\nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends \nTwitter: zanisff \n\nPlease fill out an application at http://zanisfurryfriends.org and return to \ndogs@zanisfurryfriends.org \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Sundays and sometimes on Saturdays--please ask by writing us at dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application by Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n\nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

She is an Akita/Husky mix that was so severely matted her fluffy coat had to all be shaved off.  Her reddish-brown and white coat is very short right now, but it is growing back!  Angel is now spayed, fully vaccinated, and weighs 50 pounds.  Her prior lifestyle is unknown, but she does show a definite dislike for other dogs.  Cats and other small pets would likely be seen as \"prey\".  Angel is friendly with people and really goes nuts for treats.  She is not always housebroke here-she just needs a personalized potty schedule!  Angel is aloof sometimes and probably doesn't understand why she is here.  She will be 7 years old next month.  Angel hopes the next 7 years will be spent in a \"forever\" home with loving care and yummy treats for her!  Update:  Check out her new pictures to see the \"before and after\" transformation!  She is much more social with people and is up to 67 pounds.  She has really blossomed  and would love the comforts of a home now that she is 8.",

You must contact Debbie at 979-279-6388 to discuss or meet the dogs here.  Until a few months ago, this was just a catch and kill facility with no adoption program and virtually no hope for the dogs that were impounded here.  A local resident (Debbie) and other concerned volunteers are leading a grassroots effort to save as many of these dogs as we can.  If you are interested in one of the dogs here, call Debbie immediately at 979-279-6388.  These dogs do not have the luxury of time.  The urgency can't be overstated.  \nUnfortunately, in most cases we know nothing about the dogs' histories....medical or otherwise.  We do our best to learn about their personalities and will always be completely honest based on our observations.\nPlease visit our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Urgent-Animals-of-Hearne-Robertson-County-Texas/472642442810842\nA vet reference is necessary to adopt an animal from this facility.  To discuss fees and the adoption process, call Debbie immediately at 979-279-6388.",

            "description": "Hi!  My name is  Stella.  I'm a friendly young dalmatian labrador retriever mix female, about 4-5 years old, who ended up stray in the high kill East Valley shelter in Van Nuys.  Luckily for me, Rescue saw me and got me out of there quick.  Now I live with a group of dogs in a kennel in Newport Beach .. what fun!  I get to play all day long and have made so many friends, 2 legged and 4.  I am friendly with people and other dogs altho i do not like other dominant female dogs, I am well behaved in the car and while I could use some training, for my size and age I walk nicely on leash.  I have a nice short coat, easy to keep clean.  I am spayed, microchipped and have all my shots so I'm ready to go home anytime you call for me.  Couldn't you make room in your home and your heart for a long patch eared pup like me?\n\nIf you are interested in me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., by email to dalrescue@sbcglobal.net.  Upon submission and approval of an adoption questionnaire, to see if we might be a good match, arrangements can be made for you and your family to come meet me and my friends at the kennel where I live.  I am very much looking forward to finding my new family and forever home so please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., as soon as you can, and ask to meet me, Stella.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love reading your posts and seeing your photos of life with your spotty friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!",

            "description": "Meet Avi! He is the true meaning of rescue.  Avi used to live with an abusive owner, until we changed his path! He has come so far, and has been clicker trained, but is still healing and will need a patient adopter who is willing to continue his training.  He is 4-5 years old and weighs around 55 lbs. He loves everyone he meets, but is not good with children or cats, and doesn\u2019t understand why they move so fast.  He is slow to trust, but very playful and affectionate once he knows he is safe. Avi will jump a fence that is smaller than 6 ft tall, and will need long daily walks.  He currently lives with and loves his boxer bulldog mix foster brother, but knows he is the pretty one!  A home with another playful husky or other dog similar in size would be ideal! HUSKY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. CANNOT BE PLACED WITH CHILDREN OR CATS.   If you want to be a part of Avi\u2019s recovery and future, and are willing to invest in long term training, apply for him today! His adoption fee is $25.\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: http://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. You will receive an automated confirmation once your application is successfully submitted.  Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call ASAP.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "HOUND- Sleek cream jacket, tan oval spots near hips, tan at base of tail, around face and ears.  53lbs\nADULT MALE; Est DOB: 2015\nARRIVAL: September 9, 2017\nHISTORY:  Owen was pulled from a high kill shelter when space became an issue.  At the prior shelter,  he had taken up with a family as a stray but they could not keep him long term.\nMEDICAL NOTE:  Owen has limited range of motion in his left hip likely due to an untreated older injury.  He takes daily meds to manage his pain.   Owen runs and plays like any normal, happy dog and the limited range of motion in his hip does not slow him down\u2026at all!\n\nI\u2019m at my best surrounded by toys and more toys and yes, a human by my side. Howdy, folks.  It\u2019s me Owen.  I love to play. I love my purple stuffy!!! I also like to chase tennis balls. Folks have commented on how I can seemingly self entertain for long periods of time if given just a few simple toys.  I will carry and throw toys around and then roll on my back in great delight.  Still can\u2019t believe the good fortune I have come upon in winding up at CFC!   I\u2019ve never met a stranger and I\u2019m told I\u2019m graced with a super sweet disposition typical of many hounds.  I\u2019m a good match should you already have a dog in stock but cats look just like small little toys to me so they are not a good choice for me!  LOL. I\u2019ll admit, I get very excited when I see someone heading toward my pen with a leash. I get so excited it\u2019s hard for me to focus on what I\u2019m told. But I sure am enthusiastic with my affection! I\u2019m not so happy when it\u2019s time to go back inside the pen, though. Sometimes I have to be lured inside because I am so afraid I\u2019ll be left alone again. I would love to be adopted by someone who could be patient with me until I gain some confidence and feel secure once more.\n\nStaff Update Nov 2020: \u201cOwen is a five-year-old hound mix who has been with us at CFC for about three years. The first thing you\u2019ll notice about Owen is how much he loves his toys, especially his tire. It rarely leaves his mouth, with one employee describing it as \u201clike a kid and his stuffed animal.\u201d He loves people and food, although he can be picky with the latter. Owen is notorious for eating everything in his winter food mix other than the cherries. He is an energetic dog and loves to play. If he really likes you, he\u2019ll nuzzle his head into you like a hug. Owen can be a little reactive towards strange dogs and loud noises, but after some time to get used to new dogs he warms right up to them. Does a friendly game of tug-of-war with Owen sound like your cup of tea?\u201d\n\nUpdate October 2020: It's Owen's time to shine! We're not sure why this incredibly handsome, fun-loving guy hasn't had more adoption interest, so we're giving him a moment to bask in the spotlight. Surely the right home is out there for him. Could it be with you?\n\nOwen arrived at CFC almost exactly three years ago, and we've learned a lot about him since then. For example, we just recently learned he LOVES going for car rides! He hops right in and even flops on his back in delight as he settles in for a new adventure.\n\nHe gets super excited when he sees volunteers heading his way, and he has mastered the \"sit\" command. He is treat-motivated, which always makes training much easier, and he takes his treats very, very softly. He can be strong out of the gate, rarin' to go, but once he burns off some energy, he's a terrific walking partner. A regular exercise routine would keep him at his best. An old injury limiting the mobility of his left hind leg does not slow him down at all. He is eager and ready to hit the trails.\n\nBut what Owen is most famous for at CFC is his love of toys. Give him a toy, and he just lights up. You'll swear he's smiling as he runs around gathering all the toys, rolling around with them, and tossing them in the air. He can self-entertain, but he really likes to have a human partner in play. A note of caution though: he will tear his way through stuffed toys pretty quickly, so tough toys (especially with a squeaker) are the way to go, unless you enjoy cleaning up lots of stuffing.\n\nWe currently have Owen listed as a hound, but after spending some time with him, it's clear a flavorful mix makes up his genetic recipe. There might be a pinch of Aussie or Border Collie in there, or even Brittany Spaniel. Whatever his background, we think you'll agree that the result is one beautiful dog.\n\nOwen is still young--only about five years old--and weighs in at around 53 pounds. He prefers a home without cats. He can get very excited meeting other dogs, and he hasn't quite mastered the art of politely introducing himself to them, but that is something that can be worked on through training.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, energetic, happy dog, look no further!

Very well socialized, loves to play, very active and sweet and a puppy at heart..  Bob would require an experienced dog owner, and probably a home without other dogs.  Bob is fearful of dogs and people he does not know. A patient and local owner would be ideal as to come and get to know Bob. He has been neutered and current on his shots.  Approx 45lbs Please let us know if we can answer anymore questions on Bob at: adopt@rescuek911.com\n\nAdoption Donation: $100.00\nAdoption Application: www.rescuek911.com",

In the shelter he showed no signs of aggression toward other dogs or people.  When we got him home he acclimated quickly and integrated with our other two dogs just fine.  One of our current dogs named Outlaw (11 Years old) tends to have issues with meeting new dogs but once he is used to them he is fine.  Both Outlaw and Taz are mostly fine together but there have been a couple big fights over triggers (i.e. our neighbors dogs barking or other dogs being walked by our backyard fence,, food, etc..)\n\n\n\n\n We walk Taz with our other very passive dog named Kaleah (Shes a 50 lbs Pointer mix of some sort) and there are no issues with her.  \n\n\n\n\nWe hired a dog trainer and after two meetings to assess the situation they recommended we re-home Taz.  At this time they also recommend that Taz be crated while in the house to avoid any issues with him and Outlaw.  I have been working with Taz during our walks but his extremely intent at focusing on what his \"triggers\" are.  we have had visitors to the house and he is friendly to them but He is very excitable.  \n\n\n\n\nSo this is our dilemma, we do NOT want to send him back to the shelter center because as much as they are doing a really good thing for dogs they are still not No Kill and we feel he will be Euthanized.  He is really just too sweet to not try and help but he needs attention and care that we can not give him.  As well we feel restricted  because of our other dog that he does not get along with. \n\n\n\n\n",

I am 7 years old.\n\nI had been kept on a chain, since I was a puppy and for the entire 4 years I lived at my former home.\nI lived far away from my owners house, in a back field, and I never saw other people.  \n\nI am not shy, but I do not understand this touchy thing people want to do to me, but I can tolerate being touched for a few minutes.  You see, I was never touched before, and I think it is strange and weird that people want to touch me.  But I like it when my foster mom rubs my ears....\n\nMy foster mom says I have come a long way since I got to her Bed and Biscuit back in February of 2017, but says I still have a way to go yet.\n\nI do NOT like other dogs because they scare me (like the coyotes that came out of the woods and night where I used to live), and small animals are a food group to me (because I was so hungry), so no cats, rabbits, chickens...  you know...  \n\nI am here at the Bed and Biscuit trying to learn how to be a good girl...  and if you want to talk to my foster mom about me, that would be ok.  But she is really going to be super picky about anyone that might be interested in me...  you know...\n\nIf you would like to sponsor my care, while I get better, that would be PAWSOME!",

Cosette is a 12 pound, six-year old, spayed female Chihuahua who came into the shelter as a very scared little girl.  Now in a foster home, she gives great kisses and will snuggle under the covers if you let her.  \n\nShe is good with cats, dogs, even pigs and chickens, she loves kids, she rides wonderfully in the car, she is crate trained and potty trained! Cosette is a sassy little girl that will roll on the ground to scratch her back any chance she gets! She walks like a show pony and loves snuggling in your lap to watch a movie. She is perfect. She deserves the perfect family, could that be you? She will bring so much love and loyalty into the life of whoever adopts her. Cosette prefers to not be crated as she was isolated in a crate a good part of her earlier life and is thriving without crates. \n\nPotential adopters need to know that Cosette is being seen at the Eye Clinic for Animals twice a year and is on two kinds of daily eye drops which will be a yearly expense of about $585.\n\nTo meet Cosette or learn more about her, email fciaadoptions@aol.com. As we are currently not having any adoption events, we are asking interested people to please fill out our application at www. FCIAnimals.org and if it looks like a good match, we will arrange an introduction.",

She was found abandoned with her 3 siblings living under a house at 5 weeks old.  But she's a fighter through and through!\n\nYou see, her siblings all left for homes in PA but she had to stay behind.  Goldie has a condition called Congenital Lymphedema, predominantly in one of her hind legs. It's very rare, the specialist who saw her said he's been practicing for 24 years and has only seen 2-3 cases.  After several consults, the vet feels confident that she's currently a happy, healthy, playful puppy and her life expectancy is 2-3 years. Initially, she was on several medications to help manage swelling and pain, but after switching to all natural methods including Tumeric and CBD oil, she is now off all medications and doing INCREDIBLY well--pain free!\n\nWe'd love for her to find a home where she can find that love and compassion for the 2-3 years she's got.  She lives in a foster home today with other dogs and holds her own!  She sleeps in her crate through the night and is house trained.  If you think you're the person or family for Goldie, please let us know!  We can also discuss more regarding Congenital Lymphedema and AJL's commitment to help with medical bills.",

She's a bit of a goofball and fun is her middle name. Insist that she sit and eventually you'll get a funny girl rolling in the grass. Ellie is like coffee in the morning, she really perks you up! Her adoption fee is $150. Ellie is currently being treated with flea, tick and heart worm preventative.\n\nEllie was adopted in May 2018, but returned 4/22/19. Still as caffeinated as ever, her energy proved to be too much for her new family, especially with the added responsibilities of a new baby. Pets, like humans, have a range of needs - some need more attention, interaction and guidance than others. Ellie is one who needs that bit of extra help for her to reach the level of happiness where she doesn't jump or crawl under the fence or dart out the door. She's seeking an owner/family who will provide the mental and physical stimulation that meets her needs so she can be the dog you dreamed of.",

Her family chose to surrender 4 of her dogs to ATDR so we could help place them in loving homes as she would have wanted. It has been a confusing road for this sweet fellow, but Wallie is excited to find his new forever family. He loves to be petted and cuddle on the couch but is also very gregarious and needs a calm home with an experienced, but gentle and loving pack leader to guide him. His personality seems to be more like a Beagle. He gets along well with other laid back dogs, however he must go to a cat free home with no pocket pets. He also dearly loves his toys...they are his babies and he takes them to bed with him and he just loves to play fetch. It is his favorite thing. He uses the doggie door and will go outside to potty, but prefers to relax where the people are in the air conditioning. His Beagle side is very chatty when he is excited but he behaves very nicely in his crate at night and when his foster mom goes to work. Wallie requests a home with a securely fenced yard.\nWallie is ready to find his forever person or family. He knows they are out there looking just for him.",

Please click on \"More About Us\" for the link to the form. Any inquiries/questions sent without the completed form will NOT receive a response. Thank You for understanding.\n\"Special needs\" Ginger is an affectionate 4 year old girl who had a rough start in life.  She weighs about 13 lbs and is very friendly and playful.  For the first year of her young life, Ginger was strictly confined in a small crate with only a few potty breaks, and as a result she suffers from claustrophobia and is terrified of leashes.  Despite all this, Ginger loves nothing more than to jump up on your lap for a tummy rub, or sit beside you on the couch watching TV.  She loves to sleep in bed with you, too.\n\nGinger is perfectly potty trained and uses the doggie door without fail.  She likes toys and chew bones, and is fine with other pets.  Ginger is a loving girl in search of a forever home that is as special as she is.\n\nHer adoption fee is $125 and includes her spay and all vaccinations.\n\nFor more information, please call \"Sandy\" at 602 993 9393.",

She is spayed, current on vaccinations, and house trained. She is a very affectionate girl that loves to snuggle with you. She is great with people and kids. Nyla is dog selective, so probably best to be the only dog in the home, but we can do a meet and greet if you have another dog. If you can give Nyla the perfect home transport can be arranged in SW or Central Florida. Please contact us if you are interested in meeting Nyla! 2/1/21 12:57 PM",

He is basically a sweet little guy, who may have experienced some unpleasant circumstances in the past. Though he would prefer a cozy home with adults and older children, Zeus might adapt to a friendly family home as well.  Take a real close look and see if that face doesn't remind you of a certain character in Star Wars.\n\nNOTE:  To adopt, you must live within approximately 100 miles of one of our adoption sites (Benld, O'Fallon or Springfield IL), and be at least 18 years of age.",

After finding herself down on her luck, she is looking for an angel of her own to show her just how wonderful life can be.  Maybe that someone is you.    Faith is a smooth-haired merle Australian shepherd mix with lovely red and white markings offset by her striking blue eyes.  Faith is quite shy to start but this adorable girl is absolutely worth the effort.  Once she gets to know you, she is all in with belly rubs, kisses and tail-wagging galore!  Faith will truly blossom in a home where she feels loved, cherished and safe.        \n\nFaith needs her angel to hold her paw each step of the way and give her the courage to come out of her shell and really embrace the beautiful life waiting for her. This also mean Faith needs a fenced in yard where she can be free to run and play, fetch and chase.  Faith will also be very happy curled up on the couch watching her favorite old movie with her new family.   After all, movie night is the optimal time to work on loving her, petting her, sweet-talking her, and outright adoring her until she finally concedes, \u201cit\u2019s a wonderful life after all\u201d!  \n\nFaith is between 3-5 years of age, housebroken, spayed and up-to-date on all vaccinations. She is not a candidate for leash training so she\u2019ll need to be carried to those annual vet check-ups.  Faith would be fine with another canine companion in her forever home and has tested well with cats too.   \n",

            "description": "Meet the adorably handsome Turko.  This brown-eyed beauty is about 7 years old now (September 2020) and originally came to us from a home with two female Dobies. Unfortunately, while the owners were away from home, their two chihuahuas crawled into the yard with the three Dobies and another large male dog which ended in the death of one of the little chihuahuas.  No one knows which dogs were involved or if a \"pack mentality\" took over but the owners decided to give up all three Dobies just to be safe.  Turko needed a bath and some vaccines but he was a pretty sweet guy so we got him fixed up and want to find him a new home.  He bonds really well to people and though he has some watchdog skills, he is well behaved with strangers.  Turko was an outdoor dog so he will need some introduction to indoor living but he is so bonded to people that we want to see him be a part of a family.  He only knew the company of the dogs he lived with before and we have only seen aggression towards other dogs we have introduced him to so he must be the only dog in the home.",

I\u2019ve been asking him to help me get out of chairs and he allows me to hold his harness to go up and down the deck steps and he listens when I tell him to go slowly. I don\u2019t claim to be a trainer of such things but I think with training he could be a big help to someone.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n*House trained\n*Crate trained\n*Good with friendly female dogs\n*No cats",

She's a perfect size, only 35 lbs, full grown with a gorgeous caramel coat.\n\nGinger is a sweet, very spunky girl who\u2019s still very active but also has moments of being calm and laid back. Although she\u2019s an inside dog, Ginger loves having a fenced yard where she can relax in the sun and run around safely in. She\u2019s strong on leash for her size. An active owner is best, and a person who has owned and raised dogs. Ginger is a sweet girl but can be stubborn at times. She doesn\u2019t like you to grab her collar until she\u2019s very familiar with you and has gained trust. She\u2019s good when she meets strangers, but can get very scared at the vet when she has to get shots and her nails clipped. Someone who\u2019s owned multiple dogs in the past and preferably someone who\u2019s even owned a dog with behavior issues would be a good match for Ginger.\n\nShe likes running around outside with other dogs and loves going for walks.  She loves people, plays well with other dogs, but doesn\u2019t care for overly hyper dogs who jump on her.\n\nShe's never lived with small children, so a home with kids at least 12 and up would be best. Ginger is also housebroken, spayed, current on shots.\n\n",

I weigh approximately 40 pounds. I am a sweet, bouncy girl with a loving personality.  I walk well on a leash,  very attentive to my person,  ride well in the car, love being near my person and consider myself a lap dog if allowed.  I am happiest being with you whether it is outside playing or sitting and watching TV.  I know my basic commands such as sit and come.  I am treat motivated, positive praise motivated and just want to please you by doing the right thing,  I have a silly side too which will make you laugh!  You can tell when I am happy by the smile on my face.  I like to play fetch, play soccer, sit in your lap and go for walks.  I know how to play and I know how to chill so if you are looking for a lover, please apply to adopt me!  I would love a home without cats and with a fenced yard so I can run off leash to fetch the tennis ball. A fenced yard will be a requirement.  I would make a great running and hiking buddy!   I am a very smart girl who can adjust to situations quickly. I would make a great sports dog too! I am particular about other canines and would be happiest as an only child. If interested in giving me a forever home, please complete an application at www.safeanimalhaven.com.  Thank you!\n\n \n",

            "description": "Handsome Kingsley is a great dog, handsome, fun, cute, and funny! He thinks he is a comedian. We find him to be a great, easy dog. He is self entertaining and great company!\nAbout 4 years young. Watch his video and you will fall in love.\n He use to play all day with Puddles, until she was adopted, sitting on top of the igloo and has a ball. He is loving, playful, sweet and very handsome. He is  easy on a leash and loves going for walks on the trails or cuddling on the couch with volunteers.  He is gorgeous, dog friendly, loves people. He has a wonderful personality and would make a perfect companion to go running, hiking, camping or to the beach with.\nHe has a new friend in the video called Princess Grace! \nWe do ask that adopters have canine experience with handling and behaviors, to live a happy life with their adopted dogs.\nLBWF dogs are all athletic and need physical exercise and mental stimulation.\n\n He is up to date on vaccines, micro-chipped and neutered. If you are interested in adopting Kinglsey fill out an application today and tell us what a great life you have in store for him or one of his adoptable friends!!\n\nApplications can be found on our website www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org under the Adopt Today tab.  Southern CA adoptions only due to home checks.\nTo see all of our dogs available for adoption please visit our website www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org\nFollow us on Social Media Facebook/LindaBlairWorldheartFoundation\nTwitter & Instagram @LindaBlairWF\n",

            "description": "Ruffles came to TARP via Troy Pound in Troy, AL. She was severely emaciated, with large sores on her body from neglect. It took several months but now Ruffles is ready for adoption. Ruffles would do better in a single dog home or with one other large dog. She is very energetic so we recommend a home that does not have small children. She would love a home with someone who runs or spends a lot of time outdoors.\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Appointments can be made by calling 334-508-2367 or emailing troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

            "description": "Introducing volunteer favorite, Batty! \n\nBatty is a four year old neutered male Jack Russell Terrier / Australian Cattle Dog Mix who was returned back to the shelter after his human crossed the rainbow bridge. Upon arriving at the shelter again it was observed that with a lot of excitement or unfamiliar faces Batty can become overstimulated and reactive. Batty is a very smart boy who thrives for \u201ctricks for treats\u201d with all his favorite shelter people! Batty has been here at the Humane Society of Lebanon County since 7/25/2020. \n\nOnce Batty gets to know you, he absolutely loves belly rubs and pleasing his people! Frankly, Batty loves his people\u2019s attention SO much that he will need to be the only pet in the home. That\u2019s right, he wants to be the only apple of your eye, so families with other pets, need not apply! Batty\u2019s perfect forever will also include a family with no human kiddos please. Due to the unpredictability and increased activity of children, we feel Batty would flourish in an older adult only home. An owner who has patience and time to devote to training and positive socialization will be preferred. Batty will need a strong leader who is good with setting boundaries in order to ensure that he does not rule the roost! It will take some patience and numerous visits for Batty to learn to trust you, but once he trusts you, he will be your new best friend! Batty also will resource guard his \u201cvaluable items\u201d and therefore need an owner experienced/educated in resource guarding in order to positively handle this mild blemish. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Batty, please fill out an adoption application on our website at www.lebanonhumane.org and email it to info@lebanonhumane.org. Applications are processed in order of the best fit for the dog, rather than first come first serve in order to ensure that we are setting both our animals and adopters up for success. Please be patient with our process as we are working on an appointment only basis at this time. \n\n",

Sonya is a loyal loving girl who is looking to live out her senior years in a home with a loving family. Ready for a committed partner to sit on the couch and just hang with you? Because that is Sonya's favorite thing to do! Even though she is a senior, she does still have some spring to her step and loves to be outside exploring and relaxing in the sun! \n\n*Sonya is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Sonya, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Sonya, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Sonya, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

            "description": "Bentlee (Male Lab/Bully mix, DOB 4/20/15) came to us as an Owner Surrender when he was a year old. Bentley is a wonderful dog but needs an experienced handler as he is a bit stubborn and unruly. He was in a home with a young lady who gave him lots of love but very little structure and manners. He can be a bit over protective and needs proper introductions with other dogs. He does however like cats. Bentlee would do well in a home with an owner who has time and patience to spend with him. He needs plenty of exercise, set boundaries, rules and older children. In time, Bentlee will soon become the great dog he was meant to be.\n\nIf you have ANY QUESTIONS or are truly interested in adopting any animal from PAW Animal Shelter Please, fillout an adoption application FIRST!

The adorable boy in this pic has found his forever home already but there are many more just like him waiting to get a freedom ticket out of a high kill shelter. We are an entirely foster based rescue and can only help save their lives when we have a foster home available. Please consider opening your heart and home to one one in need. We supply the vet care, you just supply the love! \n\nIf you are interested in fostering, please complete a foster application at:https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/4320/generic to tell us more about you. It will say adoption on the form as we use the same for both foster and adopt. We try our best to match foster families with foster companions that meet their preferences. Knowing you changed the course of an otherwise terrible fate and the joy of seeing them placed in a loving forever home, is truly a rewarding experience!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Nala.\nIve been at Dolly Goodpuppy for quite a while where watched so many of my good friends get adopted adopted. I hear they are all loving life with their families. I am excited for them but sometimes I get a little sad and wonder if my forever person will ever come along.\n\nI had a rough start in life being dumped by my original owner, but I have learned that there are some pretty amazing humans out there who love and care for me and won't throw me away.\n\nI am a very affectionate, pretty, lab mix who loves to go on long walksor runs. Whatever I can do to burn of some of this energy. Oh my gosh I have so much energy.\n\nIf I had to choose three words to describe myself, I would go with active, agile, and lovable. Isn't that a great combo?\n\nI can easily scale a 6-foot fence, (because what dog doesnt like a bit of mischief and adventure?) so I will require a home that can keep me secure and safe. I would really enjoy an owner who can find fun ways to keep me physically and mentally engaged. \n\nBut at the end of the day I still look forward to an evening curled up next to my owner. If you are looking for an outgoing, bright-eyed girl, then you have come to the right place.\n\nMy adoption fee includes; spay, microchip, vaccinations, and UTD heartworm/flea/tick prevention. \n\nComplete a foster or adoption application at dollygoodpuppy.org, come for a visit - I will take you for a walk.",

While she does fine with older children, at this point we would recommend a home without young children, as Asia seems a bit unsure with the smaller kids.  However, in the right owner's hands and with socialization training, she can learn to trust everyone.  We feel she definitely has the potential to be a wonderful family companion.",

Spot needs to be in a one dog home, with preferably no small children. \n\nThis cutie is a bit bigger than his pictures now, he came to us covered in ticks and fleas but is now happy and healthy.  He is about 3 years old and apx. 45 lbs. He is high maintenance in that he likes lots and lots of attention.  Spot is seeking an adult, indoor home with a fenced in yard.  A home visit will be need to be made by a volunteer prior to a adoption and if the adoptor is out of town it is likely that arrangements can be made with another rescue group for a curtesy home visit..   He is a wonderful dog and will make someone a very good friend! He can walk on a leash pretty well.  He is a very loving dog and has been waiting for his fur ever home, will you open your heart to him? We always take the fur babies back into our care if for any reason it does not work out.\n\nHe does really not like other dogs so we are looking for a  One dog home. Thanks!\n\n\nNOTE-FOR SPOT IF YOU LIVE OUT OF STATE TRANSPORTATION TO YOUR LOCATION IS POSSIBLY AVAILABLE WITH AN APPROVED HOME STUDY/APPLICATION.  PLEASE INQUIRE IF INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT MORE.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nSmarty pantsDate into Rescue: 9/9/2017\n\nReason for being in rescue: One of Hurricane Irma's orphans.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? None noted\nWeight: 65 lb\nHeight:\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $99\n\nFence needed? Yes, a high fence he can't climb. He needs room to run!\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? I would love a home with lots of excercise and playtime, maybe a field to run in and play and at the end of the day when my family and I are all tuckered out we can go lay on a comfy bed in front of a fireplace! Dreams can come true, right?\n\nWhat is my personality like? I am nothing but sweet! I'm still getting used to everything around here but considering everything I've been through (hurricane Irma and moving so much during rescue) my caregivers say I'm doing great! I like to howl at the moon when I'm outside at night like a true-to-breed hound and I love to play with people and give hugs! I love to explore, I would make a fabulous tracking dog with the right training. That is what I feel like I'm supposed to do! Sniffing and hunting things down.\n\nI can be head strong, just like any other stubborn hound dog.. but with the right people I'm working through them. I would prefer to be the only dog since I can be dog selective but I'm not against meeting your 4 legged members to see if I will like them!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? I am sweet and loving a bit shy at first but I warm up to you between snacks and rubbing behind my ears. :)\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 7/18/2015. I'm really smart. I am highly treat motivated and know how to sit, hand shake, lay down and when my caregiver said play dead I even rolled over on my back belly up!\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Holden might just be the guy you've been searching for. Holden enjoys a quiet and simple life without a lot of socializing with dogs/people. He's searching for a like-minded family to call his own and he is happy to share his house with a doggy sister.\n\nSeeking:\n-Home WITHOUT children\n-Family who is dedicated to crating Holden when guests come over. Holden is wary when new people come into the home, so he will need to be crated when guests are over. \n-Family who will provide gentle introductions to strangers. Holden can be anxious meeting new people, and is looking for a family who will take it slow with new people.\n-Home with plenty of toys and treats!

            "description": "Hello, everyone!  My name is Boko.  I came to TIRR Rescue in 2017.  My owner could no longer keep me and wanted me to have a chance at a new life.\n\nI like to have fun, but I also have a bit of a serious side.  I pick my dog friends very carefully, though I can get along with just about any dog.  I can sometimes get a little impatient with younger dogs, especially when they haven't learned to tell when I don't want to play.\n\nI can entertain myself, but I do sometimes get bored easily.  I will need a family that is willing to play with me and keep me busy but will also let me chill on the couch when I want to (P.S. I do not like for my naps to be interrupted!).  If you think you might be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nBoko is a fun dog with a bit of a serious side.  While he likes most dog, he is selective in his dog friends.  He is not at all scared of the vacuum, sometimes forcing rescue workers to vacuum around his body.  When you want him to do something that he does not want to do, he will try to distract you by giving you his paw and smiling.  Though Boko is not always good at first impressions, he does impress once you get to know him.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Boko, please visit tirrrescue.org/boko.",

He has been in this rescue program since Aug 2017, when he and boxer sister witnessed the passing of his human mom and wasn't removed until days afterwards when she was found deceased. \n\nSOCHI is neutered, house-trained, vaccinated. He has separation anxiety in a crate but is excellent loose in a home, never has been destructive with anything here when we are sleeping or gone. This is a small boxerboy at 45 lbs. and is a lot of boxer in a small package!   We would prefer an only dog household due to his previous bouts of charging other dogs trying to challenge and was only with his sister before was adopted. He has shown he doesn't like a couple breeds so far, so would prefer to be the only dog in the home. \n\nSOCHI is absolutely a nut and kicks up his heels, acting like a 9 mo old pup..If you redirect him outside or give a soft toy (he loves them!) he settles down. He should be around small children because when he gets over excited he could definitely knock someone over accidentally and cause injury. But he does love people and kids and is not purposely aggressive but could be misunderstood due to his amped up flailing in play and unusual very deep voice. \n\nWBR requirements: Fenced yard  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this silly boy, please write  rescue4boxerdogs@yahoo.com  for an application.\n\nSOCHI took over a year to recover from the loss of his mom, but is ready and waiting for someone that will finally give him the unconditional love he deserves.",

Adopted as a puppy his adopters did not put a ton of time into training him or socializing him. We are currently working to help him trust new people and other dogs. Burton loves his two-legged friends once he gets to know you. In fact, he is many of our volunteers favorites. He loves to play, but he also loves to snuggle up next to you on the couch. He is still a puppy at heart and would do well in a training class to continue socialization and confidence building. He is crate trained, neutered, and  up to date on shots.  If you would like to meet Burton, please email us at azk9org@gmail.com. You won't regret it!",

She has had a hard life and appreciates the company of people who are kind to her. \n\nWe think Elsie would best thrive as an only pup (After all, who wouldn't want to have all the snuggles for herself?)\n\nElsie is current on vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped. She is current on heartworm preventative and flea preventative.\n\n\nIf you are interested in sweet, snuggly Elsie, please fill out a  Dog Adoption Application at www.petadoptionservices.org/forms\n\n\nOur adoptions include a foster period of 4-6 weeks so that you can be sure that this pet is a good fit without any pressure, and we are available to answer any behavior or training questions during that time (and beyond, if you wish).\n\n** Local adoptions preferred (within Greater New Orleans area and surrounding parishes). We do not ship animals, as a part of our adoption process is for the potential adopter(s) to meet the dog to assess if he/she is a match for the family.\n\n",

You may have noticed I have been hangin' out here for awhile and I would soooo love to find a special family of my own who understands we big luggy guys so let's get properly introduced.\nI am an approximately 8 year old American Bulldog.  I am a friendly, mature, mannerly and mellow fellow seeking the same in a quiet home where I can laze away the day with my favorite things - lots of love, attention, an occasional stroll, a tour in the car, a heart to heart gab and a welcoming lap to lay my head on for plenty of ear scratches.\nIn the custom of we Americans as you can see I am a handsome, sturdy yet athletic fellow having recently completed an extensive fitness program.  I am loyal and determined at times and look to the same in my family with calm, consistent,  and patient leadership.  My foster pawrent has worked exceedingly hard with all that uuhh hummm former life luggage stuff to bring me where I am today - a well rounded, reliable and wonderful companion.\nI must admit though that I am a bit discerning on a few arrangements.  I would do best in a home without small children and I may be somewhat discriminating on the canine companions so ideally I am probably best as a single roomy in that respect.\nAlrighty a few of those more practical details:- My adoption fee is $350.   I have been neutered, fully vaccinated, heart worm & tick diseases tested negative & preventatives given.  If you feel you may be the family to welcome me into your heart and home as your new furever friend PLEASE complete the application found at this link  https://form.jotform.com/72823870527260 or email us directly at bbbcrescue@gmail.com  with full contact information to open discussions and learn more about our adoption process.  A volunteer will be happy to help you and we just request your patience as we are volunteers doing our best to handle all the day to day needs of our dogs, our busy rescue and our families.  \nPLEASE note that we adopt only within the province of Ontario and preference will be given to potential adopters within our local areas provided they qualify and are the best fit for our dog.\nThanks everyone!",

Here is what he has to say about himself and his perfect forever family:\nI love to be out in the yard checking things out and coming back to report all of my findings. Ball chasing is awesome - if you see me catching the ball in mid-air, you will think I may just be an agility dog in the making! I prefer the comforts of home, like cuddling on the couch with my favorite humans. Dog parks and hikes are just a little too chaotic for me. I like my house. Did I mention I like being home? Well, I do. Do you have a loving home with a fenced yard for me to run around in? If you do, I think you may be the one for me!\nAdoptions in metro Atlanta area only.",

She gets very excited on car rides as other cars go by (she is trying to chase them).\n- Joy loves going on walks and knows her basic commands. - Joy can get along with other dogs but will push herself onto other dogs with dominant gestures which can cause problems if uncontrolled. Unless you are an experienced bully owner we therefore recommend that she is the only dog in the family. No dog parks, no cats, no small dogs, no children younger than 6 years.\nJoy has a lot of energy and her three legs do not slow her down. There are no restrictions on what home she should be in. You will need to be able to provide daily exercise for her to keep her energy under control. She can go up and down steps without problems. Joy is all muscle and will jump in the car all by herself. You will be amazed!We would love to see Joy go into a home with a fenced in yard (4' minimum height). She loves laying outside in the sun during the day.Joy is in good health otherwise.",

            "description": "This trio is a family unit.  Sterling, the Dad, protected his babies after they were dumped in the country.  He watched over them so well that everyone trying to catch them thought he was their Mama.  Both puppies were very young, and they ran hard to keep up with Sterling as he moved looking for food.  He shared his food with them and kept them warm and safe at night.  They were roaming loose in a certain area for about a week when someone contacted us, afraid they would be hurt or worse.  Someone was able to get the puppies, and we went after them right away.  The next morning, the police department called to let us know that \"Mom\" was howling and frantically looking for her puppies.  We loaded the puppies up, and drove to where \"she\" was exhausted after a morning of searching and was resting.  We took the puppies out of the car with leashes, and sat down.  This frightened dog covered the ground between us quickly when the puppies were spotted.  Imagine our surprise when we learned she, was a he.  \n\nThese three need to find a home together.  I believe the puppies would be okay separated, but I don't believe Sterling would be.  He loves them, and they love him.  We have made a commitment to do everything in our power to find a home where they can stay together.  The pups are around 2 years old old and Sterling is an adult, probably around four years old. They are never very far away from each other, and we see them like this photo all the time.  (The pup laying down in the front has been adopted). They sleep together, eat together, and need each other.\n\nThe adoption fee for this trio is $300, which is $150 less than our normal fee..  They are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and healthy sweet babies.  Skylar, the mostly white one, is a girl.  Dusty and Sterling are boys.  Please contact Lori at 405-620-2411 if you think you can offer this little family their forever, together.\n\nNOTE:  The puppy closest to the camera has been adopted.  The trio are the three next to each other.",

If you do call, please ensure that you are calling from the number you wish to be contacted at and that your number is not blocked.\n\nWe typically do not do OUT OF STATE adoptions, especially pups since all vetting is done locally. \n\nOur dogs are spayed/neutered, have been given age appropriate vaccines and are microchipped.\n\nCome meet our adoptable pets at PetSmart in Newnan, GA\n\nStore Location: (They do not have specific information on our adoptable pets)\nNewnan Store #278\n1072 Bullsboro Dr\nNewnan, GA 30265",

Hooch was rescued by a Good Samaritan who asked Make A Difference Rescue to accept him in the rescue. Of course we said yes and Hooch is a very happy boy!! He is very affectionate and loves being with people. He is very eager to please and is treat motivated. Hooch loves peanut butter filled bones. He is dog social, but unfortunately we do not know how Hooch is with cats. Children 12 years old and older. Hooch's forever home is required to have a fenced yard where he can safely run and play. He is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Hooch is very excited to meet his forever family . . . is it with you??\n\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Hooch's adoption fee is $275.",

This young Carolina Dog mix and his brother were transferred to us as puppies, a mere two-hours before their brief lives were scheduled to come to an end. Little is known about their back-story, but they were picked up as strays with evidence of physical trauma -- presumably from abuse. The outcome of that, for Murdock, was what appears to be trauma-related brain-injury, with resulting developmental delays and visual \"miswiring.\"  Steadily, with the passing of time, we\u2019ve seen him evolving, with clear signs of incremental improvement [ex: increased visual tracking ability and less time \"watching airplanes\" that don\u2019t exist (not to us, at least!)].  As Murdock has matured, he has developed food-guarding behaviors; so he won\u2019t be adopted to a home with children.  Despite his life-challenges and tough breaks (including treatment for ehrlichiosis), Murdock is one of the most innocent and cheerful beings on earth, with unwavering optimism \u2014 which says much about him! We hold hopes that just the right person will show for him; he is best suited for a companion with plenty of patience, dedication to the process, time and love to give\u2026someone who can both accommodate his differences and support his potential.",

He is neutered and current on shots. He loves to play with other dogs, but will chase cats. He is food aggressive, so will need to be fed separately by himself. He should go to a home that will take the time to teach him house manners. He should not go to a home with small children as he can be a bit rough and active. He has lots of energy and needs someone to give him exercise and stimulation to work it off. He would love to be part of your active, fun loving family! Will you give him a chance to be your Hero?\nHero is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.)

            "description": "Roxxy is likely a Jack Russell Terrier Mix. She was born about July 2006. She weighs 12 lbs.\nIf you are you looking for a running partner or a dog with which to do lure coursing or earth dog competitions, Roxxy may be the dog for you! She needs lots and lots of exercise. Then more exercise and lots and lots of training and guidance (to which she is quite responsive).\nRoxxy is very independent with (did I mention this already?) an extremely high activity level. She lacks K9 to K9 social skills. She\u2019s scrappy, yappy and rude. She only manages to stay out of trouble with the most easy going, best socialized or biggest dogs. Dog parks will not be on the radar screen for her anytime in the near or far future. Harnessing her boundless enthusiasm and high play drive into something more then reactive energy will be both the challenge and the reward.\nWhile very dog savvy cats appear to be able to manage her behavior towards them, a kitty-free home would be best.\nRoxxy is crate trained.\nTraining contract required.\n\nNote: Roxxy will not be shown at all pet fairs. Please let us know if you are interested in meeting her so we are sure to bring her on that date.",

He needs a family who will take the time to work with him to make him the best dog he can be. He is full of energy and needs lots of exercise to be happy. He loves to go on walks.\nMac is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes Neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435/752-3534.

She is a smart pup who is eager to please, so continued training would be an excellent way for her to bond with her new family! Libby is a well-natured pup who loves to play, and we believe she would benefit best from an active family who has room for 2 as Libby would do best if she could stay with her brother Ranger.\nLibby is great with other dogs and has been well socialized; she is interested by cats but has not lived with them. Libby loves all people and thrives off of attention and affection! She plays hard and still has lots of puppy in her, so she may be a bit too rough for small children or very small dogs.\nLibby has been spayed, she is UTD on her vaccinations and is ready to be part of a family!\nPlease contact us for more information about this magnificent girl.",

He is neutered, up to date on his vaccines, and chipped. He is a happy, healthy boy! \n\nHe is house, crate, and potty trained. Walks well on leash. \n\nHe is very affectionate, sweet, eager to please, smart, and just wants to be loved. He has a medium energy level indoors, and a typical goof/sweet disposition. \n\nHe does well with other female dogs, but can be selective with other males. A slow introduction on leash is recommended with other males. He has been in doggie day care with 30 other dogs, male and female, many breeds and done great. \n\nHe loves people, and would do well with children. \n\nGabe would do well in an active home, where he can go on plenty of walks/hikes, maybe even jogging, and have lots of play time with his people. Inside he is pretty much a snuggler and couch potato.  He would do best with kids, other female dogs, or even as an only pet. \n\nOur adoption fee include alteration, current vaccinations, heartworm testing, microchipping and transport expenses. \n\nAdoption fee is $200 to help offset travel and medical expenses. \n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt",

Slightly insecure little guy, a little needy.  He loves to be held.  He has a \"Don Knotts\" personality.  \n\nA fenced-in yard is required.

She is very affectionate, loves to go for walks and just hang out with people. When she looks at you with her beautiful brown eyes, she will melt your heart. DORA NEEDS TO BE THE ONLY DOG. NO CATS!!! NO CHILDREN!!! Her forever home needs to have a fenced yard where Dora can safely run and play. She is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on monthly heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Dora dreams of becoming a soccer buddy or fetching a ball with her forever family!!\n\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs.

This is a loving girl (she likes to give small kisses) but is high-energy and in need of training. She will need an active owner (possibly a runner) willing to give her the love and attention she craves along with the exercise and training to help Mia live up to her potential. Along with a lot of good-quality human companionship, Mia will benefit from positive basic obedience training to help with leash training and other obedience commands. Mia is good with other dogs but may need to be introduced slowly due to her rambunctious nature. She is crate trained. For more information on Mia, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495.",

            "description": "One of the first things people ask about Bentley is \u201cWhat kind of dog is that?\u201d given his unusual looks, followed by \u201cWhat a dog!\u201d given his incredibly bubbly personality. Such a unique dog must have an equally unique story and Bentley is no exception! Bentley\u2019s story starts with him landing in a municipal shelter where this active and friendly dog had no outlet for his energy. He was then transferred to our partner organization, Save Our Strays, that saw the potential and drive in Bentley and started working towards getting him into a board and train facility that would benefit him. That\u2019s where Adopt-A-Dog and Ernesto at DOGS 360 came in; to train and work with Bentley until we could find him a home. This program had Bentley working with both Ernesto and other dogs daily to help work on his manners and also provide much-needed socialization. The greatest boon is that this program was in a home environment, so Bentley got a foster experience while also becoming the dog we knew he could be.\n\nDue to his stay at DOGS 360, Bentley has made great strides in his socialization skills as well as his manners. We learned that Bentley is a tug master who has plenty of canine friends. He is the ideal companion for a family that likes to be outdoors (he LOVES going for bike runs) and would be by your side on a hike. Bentley\u2019s ideal future family would learn all the training he has learned and continue to give Bentley the structure and consistency he needs to flourish. For that reason, we would love to see Bentley in a home with older kids that could learn his training alongside him. He is a friendly and goofy dog that is waiting to become your next family member, so why not come and meet him today? You can\u2019t say no to a face like that!\n\n\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7\n",

            "description": "When people talk about dogs.. wishing they could be more like a dog.. Poe is what we refer to.. he's had some rotten luck in life.. but he is such a happy, fully present, utterly content wounded wanderer! Po sustained an injury and now his hind legs move as one limb with two paws!  ITS AMAZING actually how well he moves along.. PLUS.. he's got an incredible attitude! Happy.. Poe is a happy happy sweet humble boy who's only got space for happy!\n\nPoe thoroughly enjoys group plays with other get-along kinda dogs.. a challenging male dog will prove to be a bit threatening to Poe so we make sure to pair him up with wiggly, easy going, confident doggies. Pippy, Penny, Madeline, Leo to name a few of his buddies! As stated above, despite his previous injury, Poe sure does well sprinting around the yard with his buds. Once in a while, he might trip but he always gets right back up and continues play. Now.. Poe's most FAV game ever is FETCH.. he will chase a ball all day long! He even knows how to drop the ball on command (often in trade for a treat!!) so we can give it another throw. He'll often break away from the pack to join up in a nice ball game.  \n\nGuaranteed you'll never meet another dog like Poe in your life. We're not quite sure how Poe became the way that he is but we are sure he doesn't skip a beat! Did we mention he loves to SWIM?! Check out the photos of Poe's doggy paddle skills! A long hike to the reservoir is another fav activity for Poe! \n\n***While we are very grateful for PetFinder, we have been having chronic problems receiving inquires. Please contact us directly if you are interested in adopting by emailing us at lovedogs.bedfordny@gmail.com and visit fortheloveofdogsrescue.org***",

My hero tried everything but it cannot be removed. When I'm in the house I need to wear a diaper or a belly band to prevent me from dripping. But look at my smile. None of this bothers me. I am a 2 year old 52 pointer hound mix who just loves to have attention from anyone who will give it. I am ready to play so of course I like toys, treats, playing with my foster doggies, and especially people. I am the kind of dog who is very flexible, and by flexible I don't mean I can do splits (boy would that be hard) I mean I would be fine chilling at home or cruising town on a leash. Please say YES!!

            "description": "Montana is a stunning 6yr young female AmStaff.  65lbs.  Montana is great at basic commands like \"sit\", \"down\", \"roll over\", \"paw\" and \"stand up\".  She is house broken and crate trained. She can be energetic but also loves her cuddle time..  Montana would LOVE an active family that can hike, do agility, etc.   She would do best in a home with a fenced yard or in an area that is not very congested as it takes her time to warm up to new people--she is shy at first so a crowded apartment building with no private yard would be stressful for her.   Montana does enjoy her walls and is loose leash (positive reinforcement) trained. \nMontana was found as a stray (as a puppy) with her brother Chevy.  They were taken to the town shelter where they were pulled by fur babies after their hold period.  Montana was adopted by a family hoping her presence would keep their son from moving out.  Montana and the son formed an amazing bond--he was the only one who played with her, trained her, walked her, etc.  Because of a job opportunity he had to leave and sadly no one else in the home paid much mind to poor Montana.  She was returned to us at about 2 yrs old.  A very scared and unsure pup who really didn't know much about the world. For lack of foster homes Montana went into boarding.  Then FBRR raised funds to have her stay with a trainer instead of just boarding, figuring that getting some exercise and reinforcement of her commands would help to find her forever home more quickly.   Sadly the trainer got in over her head and collected over 100 dogs.  None of which got the training they needed or reinforcement or even exercise.   Poor Montana was stuck in a tiny crate 24/7.  When FBRR was made aware of the situation we went and got her.  For everything Montana has been through she still has an AMAZING spirit!  She enjoys nothing more than to be with her people.  She greets neighbors she knows on walks and loves to go on \"sniff-faris\" searching out squirrels!  This girl can jump and climb--she is very agile and would likely LOVE some agility classes!  She is doing well playing with large male dogs that enjoy playing and are submissive.  Montana walks nicely past other dogs on her walks with no reaction.  She sits and waits nicely for her leash to be put on and she has great manners on walks and jogs!  She needs some reminders when squirrels are involved!  No small animals for her! Montana also gives the sweetest gentle kisses, hugs and nudges! Montana has no experience with children and they make her nervous so a home without children is a must.  \n\nPlease give this AMAZING girl a chance!!  She has soooooo much love to give!!  FBRR needs a foster home or forever home for her ASAP.  We can provide a trainer to work with her new family as she adjusts and settles in (we can also provide supplies if needed--crate bowls food etc) \n For more info please contact Kris at kobemnstr@hotmail.com",

He is neutered, utd on shots, heartworm negative.  Jack has met the neighborhood children and does well with them however we think he would do well with older children just because he is a bigger boy at 55 pounds and likes to play so we wouldn't want a tiny tot to be knocked down and hurt by mistake.  Jack's owner was a rescuer but sadly he passed away so Jack and Jill were taken into a boarding facility so they would not be taken to a high kill shelter.  Jack and Jill  love each other but if it helps them find a home, Hamburg Mutts will adopt them out separately.  Jack is down in boarding in TN but he can come to Buffalo if we can find him a foster or adopter.  If you are interested in fostering or adopting Jack, please go to hamburgmutts.org click on \"adoptable dogs\" and you will see our application there.  \n\n\n*************************************************************************\nDue to our adoption approval process and vetting policies, we are unable to adopt outside of the WNY area (within a 60 minute drive of the city of Buffalo \u2013 US only)\n\nFor the benefit of all involved, and to ensure the best match is made for our rescue dogs and your home-life, an application, home visit, vet reference check and adoption fee are required.   Once approved, a meet will be set up with the dog.  A meet is also required with any dog/cat currently in the home and the rescue dog.   All dogs currently in the home must be utd on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  Our adoptions are not \u201cfirst come \u2013 first serve.\u201d  Our decisions are based on the best situation for each individual dog.\n",

            "description": "Frankie came into FFR on 6/8/11 for our help to find her a new adoption home. Frankie is a very special dog. She comes from an abusive past and has flourished despite her past treatment. She is very curious yet cautious of new experiences. She does have high prey drive to other dogs and needs to be on leash at all times for control outside of her home. She has learned to play with toys and sleep in her crate. She is very smart and tries to avoid when she knows it's time to do something she doesn't want to do so we are working on her obedience manners. Frankie hasn't had a lot of attention in her short life so she is very reluctant to let you stop petting her. With supervision she ignored the foster home's cat & fine with same size male dog. Frankie needs a very experienced pack leader guardian to train her. Adult home. No kids.\nUpdate: Frankie is doing great at her trainer/boarding home. She went out for a social walk at a park and streets and she was great meeting new people. She ignored other barking dogs but did bark at dogs at a store. She needs a forever very experienced home. Best as the only dog to continue her training. We are paying for her boarding with a trainer/boarding home.\n9/30/20 update: Finally Frankie is in an experienced foster home for her golden years. Doing great. 2/1/21 1:12 PM",

Tiny and his siblings are all well-natured pups with fairly high energy levels. They would benefit best from an active family and another dog to play with. \n\nThey are great with other dogs, interested by cats and love people! They do play a little rough, so he might be too much puppy for older dogs and small children. Tiny is neutered, chipped, healthy and happy...and ready for his forever family!\n\nPlease contact us for more information about this sweet boy.",

They would benefit best from an active family and another dog to play with.\nThey are great with other dogs, interested by cats and love people! They do play a little rough, so he might be too much puppy for older dogs and young children! Tank is neutered and ready for his family.\nPlease contact us for more information about this sweet boy.",

She's a very sweet, timid, and docile girl who is a poet at heart and needs the countryside quiet to keep her soul at peace and comfort. The busy city life can scare and overwhelm her. She does well with big and little dogs (proper intros, of course!) and has paid no mind to kitty cats. She requires a home with another dog. She will snuggle up to mellow dogs that just want to hang out. For someone with a patient heart and lots of love to give, Ivy more than repays that kindness once she feels safe and accepted. She's crate trained and housebroken.\n\nThis girl is available for adoption through The Perfect Dog rescue - which makes sense, because though quite the introvert, this little navy bean is, indeed, the perfect dog \n\nPlease contact Diana at (510) 333-4420 or theperfectdogrescue@gmail.com or fill out the adoption application:\nhttp://www.theperfectdog.org/TPDadoptapp.doc",

A volunteer stepped up to foster and we sprung her bail just in time! While those eyes are still soulful, the smile now lights up her face. What breed is Georgia? Your guess is as good as ours - Shepherd/Collie/Greyhound mix? Whatever it may be, it's a whole lot of happiness!\n\nGeorgia is between 1-2 years old and weighs 60lbs. She'll be making her way to her foster home in MD the 2nd week of September. We're just getting to know this cutie and will update more soon.\n\nAnyone applying to adopt Gerogia must be willing to travel to MD to meet her, once the application is approved. \n\n~~The Last Resort is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it\u2019s like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019re still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.thelastresortrescue.com/adoptionapplication.htm\n\n",

Captain Crunch is an 8 year old male Chihuahua that was an owner surrender AFTER finding himself in two other high kill shelters (SEAACA & San Bernardino City Animal Shelters). One of our board members saw his post and decided that we needed to rescue this precious boy. Once we got him, it was VERY obvious that something was wrong, very wrong. His front legs seem to collapse and if he tries to walk on any uneven ground, he falls face first. Our vets have determined that he has congenital leg deformities with his front legs. His joints, ligaments and tendons prevent his legs from staying in socket. Sadly, there is no surgery or treatment that can fix him but we do have him on medication to help keep the inflammation down and make him comfortable. If this was not enough for the poor boy, his teeth were a horrible mess and we did get him the dental he so desperately needed. He is also getting bi-weekly Accuscope treatments to help strengthen his ligaments. We are now looking into a harness that will help his front limbs tremendously. The good news is that Captain Crunch is always smiling, is happy as can be and has the best personality. He has been neutered, had an extreme dental, is up to date on his vaccinations and is also microchipped. If interested in adopting Captain Crunch, please go to www.lolr.org and fill out an adoption application. Captain Crunch's adoption fee is sponsored, however, all of our other standard protocols for adoption will be in place.",

            "description": "What did you do last year? Well, I got surrendered to a shelter, taken into foster care, treated for heartworms, went through board and train, overcame my fears, had ACL surgery on both back legs, worked my way through several levels of obedience training, took tons of car rides, went to about 300 photo shoots...and realized that chicken nuggets ROCK.\n\nBut what I didn't do in the last year...was get adopted. What gives?!?! What's a smart, sassy and adorable pittie-bulldog mix gotta do to get adopted?\n\nDarla is 3yrs old and a bulldog-staffordshire terrier mix weighing a short 40lbs. Darla has a year of family experience while in foster care and she's ready to take her skills as an excellent road trip buddy, chaser of squirrels and connoisseur of chicken nuggets to a FOREVER family! While in foster care Darla underwent 2 ACL surgeries and lots of training classes to make her the best furry family member she can be. She loves squeaky toys, running errands at Lowe's and lazy Sundays on the couch. Darla would love to be your leading lady with no other pets or small kids in the home. Please share Darla so she can ride off into the sunset with her forever human!\n\nIMPORTANT: This animal is NOT at Irving Animal Shelter. This dog has been rescued by PAWS for Irving Animals and is currently in foster care. To set up an appointment for us to bring the dog to meet you, please follow the instructions below.\n\nDogs in our foster care program are:\n\nspayed/neutered\nmicrochipped\nup to date on all vaccinations\nnegative for heartworms and on regular heartworm preventative OR recently treated for heartworms and on regular heartworm preventative (It can take up to 6 months for a dog to test negative for heartworm after treatments. We will provide you all the medical documentation regarding the pet's treatment.)\nin loving foster care homes where they have received training and socialization to help them fit into your home more quickly.\n\nThere are a few steps to set up the adoption.\n\nComplete the\nAdoption Application\nonline. The online application is a web-based form that should be accessible on Mac, PC, tablet or other mobile device. If you'd like us to send you a PDF via email, we can do that too! If you are meeting us at an event, you can complete the application at the event itself. We require the application in advance so we can get to know a little more about you, and for better safety of our fosters and the dogs.\nSchedule a home visit. After the adoption application is received, a volunteer from PAWS for Irving Animals work with you to find the best time to meet the pet. Depending on your schedule and the schedule of the pet's foster parents, this might be at a scheduled adoption event (Adoption Events), an area park, or your home. If that initial visit goes well, a volunteer will visit your home with the pet you are interested in adopting. We will ensure that the pet you are interested in has the opportunity to meet all the members of your immediate family, including other pets, to ensure that this adoption is a good fit. We can even do a trial adoption for a period of up to 3 days if you would like. (Note: If you choose to do a trial adoption, we will hold a check for the full price of the adoption fee until you make your final decision. If you choose not to adopt, we will return the check to you when we pick up the dog.)\nPay the adoption fee. The adoption fee is $200 for dogs under 12 months and $150 for dogs over 12 months of age. The adoption fee covers many elements: full vetting (spay, vaccinations, etc), registration of microchip to you, etc. You have 3 options for payment:\n\nVia check. This can be either given to foster/volunteer at adoption hand-off or mailed as a check made out to \"PAWS for Irving Animals\" with \"Adoption - DOG NAME\" in the memo line. The check can be given to PAWS representative at time of adoption.\nOnline at\n\nhttps://pawsforirvinganimalsllc.cloverdonations.com/adoption/\n. Be sure to select the correct amount - $200 for dogs under 12 months and $150 for dogs over 12 months.\n\nYou can pay via PayPal as a \"Friends & Family\" transfer to PAWSforIrvingAnimalsLLC@Gmail.com\n\n2/2/21 5:51 PM",

A little shy when she first meets you but Coco is quick to warm up and give you her paw.  Coco loves to go for walks or play with her toys in the yard but she is super happy being a couch potato on rainy days too.  Coco can sometimes be dog selective so a meet and greet would be required if there is another dog in the home.  Please no cats and older children preferred.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Coco please fill out the adoption application found under the Adopt menu on our website at savingpawsrescue.org, or, if you have any questions email us at info@savingpawsrescue.org.\n\n",

            "description": "All this clever, affectionate, and eccentric pooch is looking for a home to call his own!\n\nGus came to the shelter when his owner abandoned him, and nobody really knows why. Was it his Resting Grouch Face (RGF)? His allergy to exercise? His firm abhorrence of tortilla chips or his obsession with french fries?\n\nWe\u2019ve come to the conclusion that Gus was unwanted because of his distinct un-dogginess. He flat out circumvents the norms of doggie society. Not to say that he doesn\u2019t do some dog things \u2013 he likes Kongs, is crate-trained, and knows so many tricks, including Sit, Down, Stay, Spin, Touch, and Gimme a Kiss! He\u2019s just got some preferences that are a bit different.\n\nDogs usually enjoy: lots of physical activity, walks, trips to the dog park, etc.\nGus enjoys: A consistent schedule, which includes cuddle time, nap time, feeding time, and visits to the backyard to (very briefly) chase a toy or two.\n\nDogs usually like: fresh air.\nGus likes: air conditioning.\n\nDogs usually want: to chase cats.\nGus wants: to give cats the right of way.\n\nDogs usually prefer: to have plenty of canine and human friends.\nGus prefers: alone time with you (and our cats?).\n\nDogs usually need: Heaps of expensive toys.\nGus needs: A comfy couch and a backyard.\n\nDogs usually accompany you: on field trips.\nGus would accompany you: on a Netflix date.\n\nGus might be closer to a housecat than a housedog; he\u2019s certainly not what most folks expect. What we know for sure is that Gus is a great companion for an easy-going person with lots of love to give. \n",

She Wears a small heart on her chest, with some white. She walks very well on a leash and rides well in the car. Shy and timid around people (except where food is concerned!), she needs a soft gentle But firm person to guide her. She takes commands well. But likes to stay hidden From view. She comes out of her shell when she thinks no one is looking! She can be dog aggressive when meeting new dogs, she can out grow it but it takes a little work. I think eventually the German breeds (boxer and shepherd ) will make her territorial and she will do best in a low traffic household. She does get along well with her brother DB and they are offered as a 2 for 1 deal to an approved home for 200$. Please contact the rescue at either pangaya@msn.com or 602-689-8506 for more info about Pooh or DB or the pair. or to come out to meet them! 2/1/21 3:43 PM",

He was handed an ultimatum and he chose the girlfriend and her dogs over Kabuki. \n\nWe are on a mission to find Kabuki a home that will be there through thick and thin, provide her lots of love and devoted to being her family when she reaches her senior years; a home she has never known and always deserved. Check out Kabuki the TV star at http://m.fox19.com/clip/14290836/save-the-animals-foundation \n\nKabuki is most likely a greyhound or whippet mix \u2026we\u2019re never sure. Kabuki loves to take long walks and is fabulous on leash while walking at a steady pace; she doesn\u2019t pull or lollygag she just is happy to *be* when she is walking :). Honestly she is over the moon happy with the time she spends walking with the volunteers taking in all the smells and the sights. Kabuki is very playful and loves to play with her toys and chase tennis balls. We know Kabuki would love a big fenced yard:)\n\nKabuki is great with children and is used to being around kids 5 years or older. Although Kabuki has done well with smaller, calmer dogs; after being attacked and hurt by dogs from her last home she does have fear of other dogs and will be happiest being the only dog-child.  \n\nKabuki will need a home that will respect her wishes to be the only dog and that home will be rewarded with a loyal, joyful and loving family member through good times and bad.  This girl will make you smile!\n\nKabuki needs: A home that understands that Kabuki wants to be the only dog, she won\u2019t want to go to dog parks or doggie day care, but she will walk and run by your side like no other dog you\u2019ve known.  She will also need a somewhat active home with a fenced yard to play in. \nKabuki would love: Positive based training to bond and build confidence\n\nKabuki\u2019s estimated birth date is December 2012. \n\nVisit our website www.staf.org for information on our adoption process.\n\n* All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n* We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n* You must be 21 years or older to adopt a dog from STAF\n* We require a physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog's behavior and exercise needs.\n* Invisible fences - Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we cannot adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n* We do request vet and personal references.\n* We are able to consider applicants within 75 miles of Cincinnati.",

I am looking for an adopter where I am the Princess of the home.  \n\nSally is a big goober who loves her toys, loves people, loves playtime and loves most dogs. She even loves to play with the water hose! On her dislike list are cats and some dogs. Sally needs to be the dominant dog and because of this, would do best in a home with no dogs or a submissive dog and older children.  \n\nNow on to all the great qualities about Sally and the list is long. Let\u2019s start with she is beautiful. Sally is very much a typical young lab. We believe Sally is 3 years old. Sally loves people and wants to meet all your 2 legged friends. She has a lot of lab energy and would definitely benefit from obedience training. Sally loves her food, what lab doesn\u2019t, so treat training should go really well. Sally already knows how to sit. She loves being outside and would enjoy taking long walks, runs or hikes with her adopter. Sally loves all those squeaking toys. The more toys the better.  Sally needs an active family who will include her in their life. Couch potatoes need not apply.\n\nAre you looking for an active dog to match your active life style? Look no further than Sally.  \n\nSally is current on vaccinations and kept on monthly preventives. She will be microchipped before adoption. Sally keeps her crate clean, but continued housetraining will be needed.  \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.luckylabrescue.com and complete and adoption application.",

Please put \"Sponsoring\" & the animal's name on the memo line of the check.\nAt this time we do consider Jack a sanctuary dog. Jack does not do well with new people. Jack does not walk well on a lead. He has pulled me down to the ground on a lead. Jack can only be adopted to someone that can meet special conditions. Jack must have a secure fenced yard. He will not climb a fence but if he ever got away, he would not be easy to catch. For travel in a car to the vet, he must be crated. Jack can only have a grain free diet. His skin is still a problem but if he gets any grains, his hair falls out.\n\nJack will need for his possible adoptive home to be an adult only home. It was recently discovered that he is very nervous around children & will hide and poop when they are present. He will also need a home with a securely fenced yard.\n\nInitial bio when Jack was first brought in: Jack is very low key. He is good with all dogs and good with cats. He is quiet. He lets my kitty knead in his belly all the time and it is not uncommon to see them sleeping together. He is squeezable. He is sweet. He loves to play with me and walk with me and stand on his rock outside. He is great about getting baths. He wipes his feet after he goes potty. He sleeps all night in his crate. Jack loves to collect all of his toys and store them in his dog bed. Too cute! He is housebroken and never marks. He came to us from an abusive/neglectful situation over a year ago, almost completely bald from demodex mange. Most of his hair has grown back in now except for a few spots that are so heavily scarred that it's unlikely the hair will ever regrow there. He seems to have lived a pretty traumatic life before coming to rescue, so he will need a very patient and special adopter. He is still afraid of men. We can only guess at what this sweet dog endured before we got him. He weighs about 55 lb now. His mom was a purebred beagle. Estimated date of birth 4/1/12.\nTLC Rescue is proud to be part of For All Paws Sake.

            "description": "Who wants fun, energetic, and adorable?! Then you want Fiona! She is interested in meeting and playing with dogs, but comes off as a tomboy and can get a little overzealous. She is crate trained, house broken, vaccinated, spayed, and knows basic commands. Fiona is strong and athletic, so an experienced, firm handler who will continue to work and train her would help to make her the best she can be. In return, they will have the most sweet, loving, happy, wiggly butt girl out there! Although she does well with some of the dogs in the house she would be best as the only dog and no cats. \n\nShe is the perfect mix. She loves to run and play, and is also the first to snuggle up in your lap for cuddles and belly rubs! If you need some alone time, Fiona is happy with a favorite toy and a peanut butter stuffed bone makes her one happy girl, as well. Her adoption fee is $325 and applications can be found on FOWA's website if you want to make Fiona a part of your life!\n\nLove Fiona, but just can't adopt another dog? Feel free to make her happy in her foster home by purchasing something off her wish list. She will be forever grateful for the extra treats and toys! https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3OVA1CAVLK48P?ref_=wl_share",

When residents realized she was pregnant, they arranged for her to be tranquilized and brought to our shelter. After 2 to 3 weeks she gave birth to 3 beautiful puppies, each of which have since found good homes. Piper has become more trusting of humans during her stay at our shelter but will need a quiet stable home environment where she will be able to continue her progress. A home within the City of Aurora would be ideal as she has become familiar with the area on her walks and would be more likely to stay in the area if she accidentally got away from her new home/owner.  Piper loves the outdoors and enjoys the company of other dogs. She does not have vision in her left eye but did have lid surgery on that that eye to relieve irritation from an inturned lid.

            "description": "Name:  Bishop\nAge: 9-10 years old\nDisability: Deaf\nBreed/Weight:  Lemon Hound, 60 pounds\n\nBishop Update July 2020 - Bishop is a sweet, quirky ,independent and stubborn guy and is a work in progress. He is not a couch potato, is quite active and loves to be able to see and be outside. He loves sleeping in the sun and watching the world go by from the security of my second story front deck. Inside, if anything is blocking his view he will remove it such as shades, blinds and curtains. His nose drives his brain, if he catches a scent, specially a rabbit he goes bonkers and should the rabbit run under the fence, he is lightening fast and will try his hardest to wiggle under after the bunny. As he is deaf he can\u2019t hear if he is called so he will not respond to a recall and will be long gone in a heartbeat. To keep him safe, he is always leashed when we go outside. He loves his long walks everyday however he is a strong guy and at times can pull very hard on his leash so needs a strong handler. Would love to take him on car rides and trips but he gets very car sick even with anti nausea meds.\n\nBishop has a fairly active bladder which means multiple trips outside at dawn, during the day and evening hours are a must. He lets you know he needs to go outside by tipping things over, plants, small tables, fans etc., if it is on the floor, nothing is off limits , even the in floor air registers, he pulls them out of the floor. He repeats this quirky behavior when he decides it is his meal time. He can not be crated, if closed in a room, will destroy the door to get out and still can not go all day without an accident\n\nHe has learned hand signals and knows sit, wait and down. He loves people and long walks but is extremely picky about other dogs and can quite bossy I am told. I do not have a cat but understand he was fine with them? While he is normally fairly quiet, he has his moments of loud barking, not great if you have close neighbors\n\n\nBishop Update October 22, 2019:\n\nBishop continues to amaze me. He is a love, full of energy who lives to explore new sights and smells...especially the smells as his nose works overtime. He would be a great walking or hiking companion provided he was always on a leash. He is always thrilled greet anyone he meets along the way with a tail that doesn\u2019t stop wagging. \n\n We had to abandon the vibrating collar as it really frightened him even set on the lowest setting and are now exploring others ways of communicating. As long as treats are part of this process Bishop is always happy to try\n\n His Aunt Jane gave him two doggy puzzles and he ?? ? ? the challenge ( and of course all the treats he uncovers)\n\n\n\nUPDATE OCTOBER 2019:\n\nBishop has been amazing in short time he has been here. Has he been a perfect angel, no, but in just two weeks he has learned the signs for come, sit, wait and down.  He sits and waits to go out and to come inside and he sits and waits for his breakfast and dinner. His leash manners vastly improved once he became comfortable with his new walking areas. Is he 100% no, but then who is, he is still a work in progress and with each day we practice, he improves a bit more and is proud of himself, you can see by the smile on his face.  \n\nWith any dog, if you want them to do something you must first get their attention usually by calling, clapping etc. but Bishop is deaf so you have to get his attention another way.  To help with this challenge, he just got a present, a vibrating collar. Over the next few weeks we will be working on training with him to understand that the jiggling of his collar means look to me for a command sign. This will be a learning experience for both of us, there will be lots of treats involved, chicken for him, hot fudge sundaes for me, He is so smart bet he does much better than me. \n\n Bishop is thrilled to have visitors come to the house,  male or female, young or old, he loves them all.  He is respectful, does not jump but follows them everywhere in the house. He loves his walks, running in the yard and chilling on the deck. \n\n I know he would love to go hiking or jogging, something this foster would love to do with him but can\u2019t ....Could you? \n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE SEPTEMBER 2019:\n\nLast Friday Bishop\u2019s life change here at PWD and very experienced  and compassionate foster person came to visit with some of our pups.  She asked if she could help Bishop (one of our long timers here at PWD).    This is her first experience with a hearing impaired dog and a hound!      In his first days they have accomplished a lot together!   Here is her first update:   \n\n \n'He had a better night last night.   He is in the doggy suite now for while in preparation to a longer stay tomorrow when I go to work. Have only heard him bark once or twice.  \n\nHe is a sweet boy and it is funny, we are working on sitting before we go thru a doorway, and while he is getting the hang of it before we leave the house, going back in is another story. He is smart and knows what I want but he will actually turn his head away from me like a stubborn child how doesn\u2019t want to do something. I have lots of time so I just wait til he decides to sit, however briefly, he gets a piece of kibble then we go in but it is so funny to see him actually turn his head as if to say, nope not doing it.  I normally wouldn\u2019t be doing this this soon but he is so smart, that I think he needs and can do these simple challenges. He gets a treat and a thumbs up sign each time he does something good. He gets a high value treat, a tiny piece of chicken, each time he potties outside as inside still is an issue.\"\n\n More updates to come from his foster home!\n\nBishop is a handsome  lemon  hound, who is deaf.  He  was surrendered to one of our Virginia shelters we partner with.  He is  about 60 lbs., fun, active, goofy pup, that will put a smile on your face.  He loves attention, and will curl up and lay on just about anything.  A sweet gentle soul good with people, cats and great with kids.  However, Bishop has some possession issues  with other dogs and so we do feel he does needs to be an only dog.   Bishop would do great in a secure  area or leash walking. \n\n  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting him, please complete our Adoption Application\n\n\n",

I appear not to be too fond of other dogs but with training I may be able to play with them someday soon!  I am young and really want a home of my own, maybe even someone to run with as I could definitely keep up!  Please come out and meet me and spend some time with me.  I promise I will be your best friend if you give me a chance!\n\nIf you are not able to adopt me, please consider virtually adopting me or coming to spend time with me on the weekends!\n\nPlease visit havenacs.org for our visitation hours, information about the adoption process and to fill out an application!",

His continued training is a condition for adoption. His adoption includes the following training:  3 in home sessions (the first being when he is brought to his forever home). 2 six week classes (basic obedience & intermediate obedience) and unlimited play groups for 3 month.\n\nTo apply to adopt Max visit http://www.moemoesrescue.com/",

We  took  Louie  home  and  nursed  him  through  his  first months.  Today  Louie  is  one  year  and  has  made  great  strides  but  still  needs  a home  that  care  care  and  accommodate his  needs.    Louie  is a  dancer  and  we  think  his  dad  may  have  been  part hyena   because  that  boy  can  jump!!!  Louie  is  environment  and tactile  sensitive  but  is  learning  how  to  accept  cuddles !  \nThere  is  no  complete  diagnosis on Louie  but the  vet  feels  there  is  a neurological impairment  which  effects  his  sight (depth perception) , balance and  perception  of  his  immediate  space.  Louies  forever  home  must  be  safe  for  his activity  and  lack  of self-protectiveness.  Louie  sees  the vet  on  a yearly  basis  ...  everything  seems  a go  health-wise.   He  appears  to be  seizure free  and is no longer on medication .  Louie loves  other  dogs  but  because  of  his  worldly  deficits   we  suggest  he  not be in a home  with  a larger  dog  unless  very, very mellow.  Louie  is  paper  trained  but  sometimes  misses  the  target  because  of his  sight.  He  uses  the  bathroom  outside on a regular basis.  He  is create trained  and  sleeps  in a  crate at night.  \nSafety  first  for Little  Louie.....  to date  his  biggest  accomplishment is  conquering the stairs.  He  now  uses  stairs......  to  some  of  us  it's  just a  stair  but  to Little  Louie  it  is  Mt. Everest!!!!  Louie  is  patiently  awaiting  the right  home  that can  serve and  protect  him.  His  adoption fee is $250 which includes  neuter,  current shots  and microchip.  Home  visit is  required",

            "description": "Hi.  My name is Sebastian, but my friends call me Bash.  I am an approximately 12 year old male, maltese mix, weighing \nin at 9 pounds. People tell me I can be quite funny and sweet.  \n\nDue to my former living situation, I didn't really learn about being housebroken, so I struggle a great deal \nwith that concept.  After trying really hard, my foster mom needs to keep me in diapers to prevent accidents \nin the house, but I am really good at \"poo\" outside, so I consider that a plus!!\n\nI tend to bark at most things I see on my walks, be it other dogs or people.  Actually, I bark \nat those things inside too, but I can settle down after I get to investigate for a while.\n\nI sometimes get a bit grumpy if you want me to do something I don't want to do and you try to hurry me \nalong.  I may start to growl and warn you that I want to do it my way.  If you can back off and coax me a little \nwith a treat, I snap out of it and usually do just what you want me to do.  However, I probably wouldn't be \ngood in a house with children as they may not understand this process.\n\nI get along with my foster brother, but I have to say he is a pretty laid back guy.  He lets me get my way and that's \nhow I like it.  My foster cousin isn't so laid back and thinks she should get her way, so we don't do well together.\n\nI like to be with my person, but please don't put me on your lap and expect me to stay there.  Just not my thing.  \nBut don't go too far as I want you close by and don't really like to be left alone.\n\nI know I have a few challenges, but if you are up to it, I'd love to meet you!!\n\n\nI love to walk around the neighborhood unless I see another dog.  I just don\u2019t like to see or be around other dogs; regardless of size, so I need to be the only dog in the family.\n\nI know that if I find my forever family we can work around these issues.  I am so sweet and will never leave your side.  I will snuggle with you and be your best buddy!  I need someone who has the time and patience to work with me so I can be the best I can be!  I don't like to be alone, so I will do best in a home where people aren't away all day.\n\nAre you my special person?",

She was rescued off the streets of Texas with a horrific case of mange. This poor baby was a sight for sore eyes, she hardly had any hair left and her skin was raw and infected. We made sure she got immediate medical care and Pansie is doing awesome now! Her fur has almost grown back completely but it may take awhile longer to get her coat back to 100% because of how severe her condition originally was. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and is great with people of all ages and does well with other dogs with slow intros. Her foster mom says that she loves her people very much and is so sweet! She would do well in a home with slow intro to other dogs or could live as an only dog as she loves affection from humans. Pansie is house trained, crate trained, loves toys to chew on, enjoys walks and car rides, and is wonderful with kids! Pansie is long overdue for her happy ever after and we are rooting for this sweetheart big time! She deserves so much more than the life of neglect that she had to suffer through for so long. If you would like to make Pansie the newest member of your family and love of your life, please fill out an adoption application here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org/general-application",

The puppies were about a week old when we finally got them out and Momma seemed very grateful for a safe place and consistent food and water for her and her babies. She's an EXCELLENT momma!! Even with limited food for herself, she kept her babies fat and healthy. She's young, about 2 years old, we think.\nShe has come a long way in a short time. She has come out of her shell and loves greeting people when they come home and is very fond of the children in the house. She loves to get love and attention. She's also discovered that she is a big fan of air conditioning :D\nShe was very tolerant of other dogs around her babies, though occasionally she would turn into momma bear and run everyone out for some peace and quiet. Most of her babies have found their forever homes and now she's looking for hers. She's got quite the personality and can certainly light up your day.\nShe is spayed. microchipped, and all current vaccines.\nAsk about this brave and sweet girl today and how to meet her and make her part of your forever family.",

I have been neutered and am up to date on my shots.\n     I know commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201clay down\u201d, and I will shake your hand once I get to know you.  I walk well on a leash and really love squeaky toys.\n      My downfall is that I can and will jump fences up to 6 foot high and escape from a yard.  A high secure fence will be a must for me.\n     The other thing to know about me is that I suffered from kidney failure in the summer of 2017.  But I have recovered from it with the help of medication and a diet of grain-free food at the shelter has kept me healthy.  Ideally, I should be on special kidney food but it is very expensive.\n     The staff describes me as very smart, loving, sweet natured, and obedient.  That is what you can expect from the shepherd breed.\n      I came here for over a year and am ready for a home to call my very own. We would prefer to adopt families with children age 10+ adopt Jackson. \n\n\n\n\n",

She does fine with other dogs although she can be a little bossy with her food. She's very affectionate and will give you kisses as she runs by playing with the other dogs or kids around! Her foster mom is teaching her sign language and she already knows sit... although she's still working on focus! :) Ask about this wonderful girl today! Please email for more information or to set up a meet and greet with sweet Shelby today!\n\nHere's a link to some more pictures of this awesome gal with the beautiful smile! http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.467765229913155.103853.155571084465906&type=3 1/4/21 12:58 PM",

He does well with big or small dogs, male and female. He just loves them all! Even if the little ones act tough, he'll just lie down on the floor and try and make them feel bigger.

She was rescued as a precious little baby from a high kill shelter.\nShe is pretty playful and energetic and gets along with other dogs, but doesn't quite realize her strength. Because of that she would do best with bigger dogs and children. She really loves the little kiddos, but she doesn't know how strong she is!\nShe is housebroken and crate trained and oh so loveable!! She would love to roll over for you and let you rub her belly!! She is spayed and microchipped and UTD on shots. Ask about her today!\nHere is a great album for this sweet girl... take a look! https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.521235697899441.113497.155571084465906&type=3",

Since being with his foster however it has become clear that this lug would prefer to be an only dog, at least at first. He is house trained, kennel trained, knows basic obedience, he's an amazing dog. He came to us because he has horrible stranger danger. He needs a calm home without a lot of people coming and going. He needs a secure 6' fence with a good sized yard. He is a bit \"round\" and he needs to continue his exercise to get to a healthy weight. He loves the water and squeaky toys, frankly he just loves all toys. This is a really great dog who was set up by his past owners to fail, and thats what happened. We are still working with him and his behavior issues and will continue. While we don't know that he's currently \"adoptable\" I think for the perfect home we would work with adopters to make it work but we need to make sure it's a fantastic environment for him. He is looking for responsible loving owners who will love him for the big goober that he is.",

We believe he is territorial for a couple reasons but specifically because he's bored out of his mind. \n\nHe has bit 2 people. He bit the mail lady once and he recently bit the neighbor when he stuck his arm over the 4' fence. We will be assessing him but he currently lives with 2 older Dachshunds and thus isn't really able to play and be the dog he wants to be. Once we get him acquainted with his fosters Saint Bernard we expect to see quite a change in this big lugs demeanor. He's very much a puppy still at 2 years old and thus not overly coordinated and mouthy. For these reasons we recommend a home without small children.",

            "description": "My name is Diva and I am a special blind girl. My other senses are keen so don't think you are pulling a fast one over on me! I am spayed ...so we got that out of the way early. I am housetrained and crate trained...so that should give me extra points. I am good with children and if they try and pull my ears I won't be a happy girl. Actually children and me are great together, I am not good with dogs and cats because I don't like those kinds of surprises. I was a surrender due to landlord issues and I would've paid the rent on time but I couldn't find the checkbook. I was frightened beyond belief and confused having been in the shelter. Through all of this I was still a sweetheart to everybody. I love meeting new people and they feel the same way. I had been living with a family for seven years including children. I do really well in my foster and when I get used to the lay of the land I am great...and I don't own a GPS. I am 9 yrs old and I weigh 55 lbs....and I guess I look pretty good even though I can't see for myself in the mirror. I am a special girl and if anybody would find it in their heart to adopt me I would be the happiest girl in the world. I would add something very special in your life that you would remember forever. Thanks for checking in on me and caring. My application is at oneloveanimalrescue.orgTo be considered as this pet's adopter, please go to www.oneloveanimalrescue.org/adopt.html to complete your application.\n2/2/21 6:21 PM",

They just look right into your soul, don't they?! \nHi, my name is Charmin! I have both strength and softness for all your four-legged companion needs. I am 2 to 3 years old. I am funny as heck and energetic to boot.  People friendly, good with dogs and older respectful kids who won't squeeze me, please. Get it...don't squeeze the Charmin'. LOL. Can't you just look at my face and see how sweet and loveable I am. Continued obedience and learning of house manners is a must. I've only had a few accidents, so I am almost there. It'd be like getting a puppy but in the latter stages. Less suffering if you ask me. LOL. Seriously, I'll have you in stitches like Earl & Mooch from the Mutts comic strip. I'm a total goof. I'd love to go running with you. Or other adventures if you are the outdoorsy energetic type. \n\nDisclaimer: When I was at the shelter, they tested me for food aggression with one of those stupid plastic hands and I failed. BUT, there has been no issue in my foster home. I mean, what the heck is that hand thing anyway?! Just know it's mild and correctable if you see it at all. I have heard that a cat is a puzzle to which there is no solution. Not sure if I've met one of those or not. If you have one of those in your family, I can be tested to see how things go to that end. Say the word... P.S. Has anyone seen Mr. Whipple?\n\nCharmin will be spayed, microchipped, and has been kept on heartworm and flea and tick preventative. \n\nIf you would like to give Charmin a forever home please complete our online application and list Charmin in the notes section.",

            "description": "Hello to you! I am glad you are reading my profile. I\u2019m looking for a place to call my forever home so read about me and let my foster family know if you think you might be just right for me.\n\nHere\u2019s my stats:\nPossible Breed:  Lhasa Apso\nGender:  I\u2019m a girl\nColors:  Classic white\nAge:  The vet says around 13 years old\nWeight:  About 22 pounds\n\nIdeal Home:  I would do best as your only dog. I have a strong personality and though I tolerate the other dogs at my foster home, I would do best as the only queen of the castle!\n\nNow for more good stuff!-\nHer foster mom says, \u201cRaven loves to do \u2018zoomies\u2019 in the yard and will run full blast and bounce like a deer. It is the cutest thing. She also dances on her back legs when it\u2019s dinner time and uses her front paws like hands to reach out for her dinner.\u201d\n\nRaven takes turns being playful and being laid back. She loves to lay next to her person and gets very comfy on the sofa. If you are busy though, she will entertain herself and be happy. Raven gets along with the other dogs in her foster home but she clearly prefers that they leave her alone. As many Lhasa Apso do, she wants to be the boss of the group. She can get very grouchy if other dogs get into her space. She has bitten when she was afraid. \n\nRaven loves to play with toys and will lay down and chew on them. She can get possessive of her toys and food. Raven ignores the cats in her foster home and was comfortable with visiting teenage grandchildren. She should not go to a home with young children since she can bite when frightened. Raven walks well on the leash but prefers just to run around the fenced in back yard with her foster. She rides well in the car and does okay in a crate, though she prefers not to stay in the crate. \n\nShe has the beginnings of cataracts but can see and is not on any medication.  So we are looking for a very special adopter that is experienced with strong dogs and is willing to work around the fears she has developed from her past, to give her an amazing home.\n\nFor more information, email my foster family at  luvdogs411@yahoo.com. Start the process of adopting me or one of the other pups by filling out the application found at www.shihtzu-rescue.com. \nPS. I've had ALL my vetting, and oh boy, it was a lot. Here's what I had done:\nDistemper/Parvo shots \u2013 TWICE. One shot doesn't cut it.\nBordetella shots - ALSO TWICE. \nSpay/Neuter-of course.\nA fecal exam so I don't have any bad worms. Treatment if I do.\nA heartworm test. Treatment if I am positive for heart worms\nBLOODWORK to make sure my liver and kidneys are working well, because you know, we doggies often have issues in the liver and kidneys.\nA DENTAL exam AND cleaning if I needed it- yep, all my toofies are checked out.\nSee, that's a LOT. Ask your vet - that's a LOT.\n\n But if you just can't wait to see if I might be your new family member, email them now at luvdogs411@yahoo.com..\n\nStart the process of adopting me or one of the other pups by filling out the application found at www.shihtzu-rescue.com. \nPS.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\nMiss Reagan appreciates a more quiet, one on one environment. She is quite a snuggler and will take in all the loving and attention you want to dole out. Don't be fooled by that though because she can be an escape artist and will not go to a home with a chain link fence. It's best she have a 6 foot privacy fence or no fence at all with leash walks. She will do great as the only dog or maybe with a buddy but that buddy will not be a cat or any other small breed or prey. She is a confirmed cat killer. Spunky Girl when she wants to be but is great inside and settles down beautifully.\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com.\n\nTo fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption",

She weighs 62 pounds, and has a short, stocky build. She has the most adorable floppy ears that are so soft to the touch! She dreams of a calm, relaxed life with good, loving people. She needs a home without small children because their energy makes her uneasy. She's good company for calm dogs, medium to large size. She's more of a companion for other dogs than a playmate.\n\nCoco is a softie when it comes to her \"babies\". She likes to carry around a stuffed animal with her. She really loves all toys and plays well alone. She enjoys peaceful naps on the hammock, leisurely walks and just hanging around the house with her friends.\n\nTake a look into Coco's gorgeous eyes and consider making room in your heart and home for her. She is waiting for you, and we would love to make that connection. The first step is to email placement@duckteam6.org if you are interested in making her a member of your family. Coco is spayed, microchipped and fully vaccinated. She is also potty trained, leash and crate trained. She's ready to have a family of her own and will make an amazing companion. 1/31/21 3:58 PM",

He is the best!!!!\nHe is more Labrador and Dalmatian, kind, personality but listed as a Staffordshire/Labrador mix. He is YOUNG and about 2 years young and full of pep and energy and loves to play! He is a darling gentleman. \nHe is a medium size and loves to go for walks and give love!\nHe's also VERY DOG FRIENDLY, loves to go to the beach, \nHe absolutely loves life and is great with all dogs! He is gentle enough to keep a cancer dog company. \nHe deserves the best home and to be the best friend that he wants to be! \nHe  was a  shelter favorite and they called begging LBWF to save him over the Fourth of July. He has proven to be a wonderful companion and friend and easy to get along with.  Henry is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and micro-chipped.

            "description": "Bruno is a special boy who will need a special owner to meet his special needs. He is a 6-year old paraplegic pitbull mix who has partial back legs. Bruno gets around well using a \u2018drag bag\u2019 and has his own set of wheels and is unaware of his disability. He is convinced he is the same as any other dog and acts like any other dog\u2026although you will most likely find he is the happiest dog you have ever met. He gets along well with dogs and wants to play and has lived with cats. He may knock over small children as he is exuberant and does not go through life at a low speed when he is moving about. He does require time and devotion to care for as he is incontinent and has \u2018sensitive\u2019 skin. He is well behaved and patient during diaper changing time.\n\nBruno holds a special place in the hearts of all the people he has touched. We all want what is best for him and we want to make sure he goes to a home who can provide for all of his special needs. Castaway has invested a lot of time and resources into getting Bruno to the point where he can find his forever home. We'd love to find a family to keep us in the loop of how he is doing.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.castawaypetrescue.org and fill out an adoption application. An adoption counselor will contact you. Please note that adoption counselors will only know of your interest if you submit an application. They do not see emails sent to the administration email account. The adoption counselor can answer your questions when they call after receiving your application. Please remember we are an all volunteer organization.\n\nMinimum Adoption Donation is $250 (includes deworming, microchip with free registration, age appropriate vaccinations, spay and 30 days of health insurance). Any donation above the minimum is appreciated\n\nFoster Home Location: Libertyville, IL\n\nOur organization uses 24PetWatch microchips, which include free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service.

Syd loves playing with his female dog friends at the rescue. He is not good with cats. His tail is always happily wagging and he walks around with a huge smile on his handsome face. \n\nSyd is such a fun companion but has no use for tennis balls and is not much of a fetcher. Rescued in Marion, Illinois, he was brought to Chicago by Lucky Dog Rescue where he'd have a better opportunity to find a loving family. He is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. \nTo meet and possibly adopt Syd, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net for an adoption application. \n\nHis adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. He is extremely healthy, neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped and heartworm-tested. He is being fostered in Chicago.",

The family took Katie in and she gave birth to several puppies. Some of them died and some were given away. Donut and his sister Buttercup as well as his mother Katie, stayed with the homeless family. We were able to rescue Katie, (WHO IS STILL LOOKING FOR A HOME) and Buttercup (at 16 weeks, who has been adopted) from the family but they refused to give us Donut, as they didn't want him to get neutered.\nFAST FORWARD: 10 months later, the homeless family decided to dump Donut at a kill shelter. Now, he was full-grown (about 100 lbs.) The children of the homeless family used to play with him and when the parents left Donut to be killed in the shelter, the kids were heartbroken. Fortunately, our rescue was able save Donut, the VERY DAY HE WAS GOING TO BE EUTHANIZED! He was absolutely TERRIFIED in the shelter. Donut didn't trust anybody at first. He has now been with us for a while and LOVES all the staff. He is a total goofball and loves to play with toys and even tried out our doggie pool! Donut loves to go for walks, he's great! He is a silly guy and would love nothing more than his own family with a house and a yard for him to roll in the grass. He gives great kisses and this goof-ball will make you laugh!\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

Likely a victim of abuse, Ripley came to the Del Norte shelter a shut-down and very, very frightened pup\u2014it took several weeks before staff and volunteers could get \u00a0him out of the kennel  for walks and interaction.\u00a0With a lot of patience and positive reinforcement in the way of hot dogs, this incredibly handsome boy slowly began to trust humans and has since learned how to receive affection (he wasn't sure about being touched before and now he loves gentle pets), how to play and how to just be a dog. \n\nShelter staff discovered Ripley is a stellar retriever and can play ball all day! He also takes treats very gently, knows how to sit, walks well on a leash, and doesn't seem reactive to other dogs. Because of his rough past and need for slow, patient introductions, Ripley would do best in an adult home with low traffic. He may fare well with another dog sibling if the match is right, though he's likely going to need that extra love and attention that comes with being an only fur-child.\u00a0 \n\nDogs like Ripley have a very hard time in chaotic shelter environments and need an understanding soul mate to gently remind them that most humans are good and that the world can be full of pleasure and fun. If you've got an extra-big heart, a patient and kind personality and the desire to mend the spirit of a very deserving pup, please come meet our boy. \n\n\nCome check out Ripcord and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531. Please call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

I am neutered, heartworm negative, current on shots, micro-chipped and on flea/heartworm prevention.  My adoption is $250.\n\nI was adopted as a puppy and returned because there is an autistic son in the home and I was too rough.  Unfortunately, the son did not understand how to interact with me. I would do best in a home as an only dog and no kids.  I am not good with cats and I can be picky with other dogs. I am very mouthy and have been known to nip in the past. \n\nPlease email for an adoption application.\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

            "description": "Brizzo was surrendered to a Humane Society because his elderly human owners were not able to handle him. He loves playing and romping with other dogs. loves to go on walks, walks well on a leash, and enjoys throwing and carrying his big sticks. He also does \"zoomies\" when he is excited!  One cute thing Brizzo also does,  is he will grab your sleeve and tug you gently to the door. Lastly, he smiles with his teeth and it is adorable!!  Photo attached! \n\nBrizzo is a very happy, calm boy, loves giving the Pyr paw, is extremely smart, and as with all Pyrs, can be a bit stubborn but he is very treat motivated. \n\nThis handsome boy  prefers women, but a male/female couple with big dog experience would probably work for him. He is resource protective, so a home with older teenage children is preferred.Brizzo was protective of his prior sick, elderly, female owner from the husband.\n\nBrizzo can be protective of his food or toys, and that is a work in progress with his foster mom. Pyrs will take over a household as the alpha if a clear alpha in human form is not present. So, he will need someone willing to work with him using positive reinforcement to show him it is not necessary for him to be in charge and to work with him on resource guarding.\n\nHe is house trained, not destructive when you are gone, and gets along well with cats. Brizzo has been waiting for the \"pyrect\" woman since August of 2019. \nHe is dog selective, but does enjoy playing with some other dogs. \n\nWe will only consider applicants with previous large breed experience for Brizzo. He will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges to a secure visibly fenced yard, minimum of 5' high, and directly accessible from the home. Pyrs do not do well with wireless fencing. They will take the shock for the freedom and become a \"Disapyr!\"\n\nSo, come on, ladies, give this beautiful boy a home! \n\nApplicants must be 25 years old, own your own home, have secure fencing and children over age 18 years old.   Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heart worm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\nWe will require obedience training for Brizzo, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine.  Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds.  They are bred to be independent thinkers. \n\nIf you are interested in giving Brizzo a foster or a  forever home, please go to our website, www.igpr.org and complete the appropriate application there. \n\nAdoption fee is $350\n\n",

He weighs around 75 lbs, and is all brains and athleticism, ready to be a hard-working partner. He excels at learning quickly and will capture your heart. Freckles would be best as an only dog, he loves his space. He needs a family that will enjoy keeping him busy with walks, training, play and mental engagement. He would greatly enjoy a fenced yard so he can play safely as much as he wants, zipping around with his toys or just being silly.\n\nFreckles came to us a few years ago after IPD found him locked in a hot car. They reached out to TLF for help. He has been hanging around getting all the lovins while waiting for his perfect family. \n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week.

She is medium in size. She will make a great addition to any family. Sandy does not like being crated.\nSandy would like a fenced yard to play without worry of her being hit by a car. PRN would like a vet reference from anyone who applies. Probably children over six would be best. You must live in the Jacksonville, Fla area.

Those commercials that give you the feels and make you all teary-eyed? Do find yourself wishing you could be a hero like the people in those films? \n\nWell look no further, because I am a senior pupper looking for just such a hero. My name is Hershey and I\u2019m a 12 year-old lab mix. I weigh about 65 lbs, am house trained and do not need a crate (I don't enjoy those things anyway).  I love belly rubs, car rides and chasing squeaky tennis balls. I\u2019m good with cats and kids. I\u2019m fine with other submissive or non-reactive dogs, though I\u2019m not especially playful. I prefer to lounge and nap until meal time. My hearing is not what it used to be, but I don\u2019t let that stop me from enjoying the good life. I also love walks and am not too bad on a leash.  I need a fenced yard in my new home because I cannot hear very well.  I would also like for my best friends to be home most of the time.  I want to spend as much time as possible with the ones I love.  I\u2019m hopeful there is someone special out there that needs a napping partner and would love to give me the home I have dreamed of my entire life. \n\nMy adoption fee is sponsored and includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting, please visit rescueonespringfield.com/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

This beautiful girl was first introduced to Angie after she had puppies and her former owners asked Angie for help with the pups. Originally, they were going to keep Ziva, but then decided it would be better to abandon her down by the Trinity. Of course, Angie couldn't let that happen, so Ziva joined Angie's Friends family. Ziva is sweet and loves people and kids. Ziva fosters with several other dogs and loves to play, but needs a slow introduction. She gets along with males and females. She's also a little protective of her toys. Like others of our larger dogs, she does need to learn some leash manners and how to channel her energy. She needs to learn she is not the leader and she will be calmer. Angie'sFriends will provide free training to her adopter.

            "description": "Sophie is a strikingly beautiful 6 year old Staffordshire mix girl. Her beauty is only exceeded by her exuberance and zest for life. She has energy to spare and is very inquisitive. She loves people and is very affectionate, wanting to be petted and loved on. While Sophie enjoys people immensely, she does not care for other canines. She has had several male friends who were her size or larger, who could put her in her place if need be, but other smaller dogs are not candidates for friends. Sophie needs a strong leader who can show her how to be a good girl. She would make a wonderful companion for the right person who does not have other dogs, has a big fenced in back yard and wants a devoted friend and pal. The ones who need a friend the most, make the best friends. Sophie has led a lonely life and now it's time for her to have a home of her own and a person she can place her trust in and to whom she can give all her love..\n\nSophie, American Staffordshire Terrier Mix has been shared from Shelter Exchange - http://www.shelterexchange.org. 2/2/21 9:01 AM",

            "description": "This is the story of Mack. Mack was born on 9/12/13 as part of a litter of 6. His Mom was a Vizsla/Hound mix and we have no idea who Dad was. He was the largest pup of the litter at birth. As the litter grew and was nursing on Mom, we quickly learned that she was giardia positive (an intestinal parasite). It was an unfortunate circumstance since we were certain she was passing it on to the pups. Since they were so young when they started showing signs of suffering from this parasite, there wasn't much we could do other than wait for them to get to an age when we could treat it. One by one, they fell ill and then re-cooperated once treatment started. Mack on the other hand, did not seem to bounce back like the others. In fact, he fell ill with this parasite more than once in his puppyhood. We treated him each time and suffered with him during his periods of dehydration, not eating, and just feeling yucky. More than once, we had to force feed him for more than a week. He had no energy. We were giving him fluids three times a day just to keep him alive. There was a point where we did not think he would make it for certain. But we weren't giving up on him. I think he knew that, and this caused him to hang in there with us no matter how bad he felt. At 10wks, he weighed only 4.8lbs when his siblings were in the 10-12lb range. Because the parasite took every bit of nutrition we were force feeding him, he was way behind in growth & development. When he finally turned the corner and started eating on his own, he was unstoppable. He would eat every 2 hrs and simply couldn't get enough. We were elated! At 15wks, he was only about 2/3rds the size of his siblings, but he'd eat like a horse and we'd pump him up with vitamins every day. As you can see from his pictures, he is certainly 1 happy pup to be alive! UPDATE: We have now found it necessary to list Mack as a \"Special Needs\" adopt. After an oral exam, the vet determined that since he was sick for so long during puppyhood, he will need a yearly dental examination. The enamel on his teeth is not as strong as it should be and is chipping off. We've been told that there is nothing to do about it at this time other than give him soaked kibble as meals. He also cannot have any hard treats or toys as that will only promote the chipping of the enamel. He seems very happy and spoiled about this and is healthy as can be at about 55lbs now as an adult :)\n\nOur adoption fee is $325 and all of our pets come with full vet records. All animals are up to date on vaccinations & dewormed. Unless otherwise indicated, puppies are NOT spayed or neutered since our vet recommends waiting until 6mos of age to do so. Please keep in mind we are a Rescue Group and most of our pups come to us with little or no background info regarding breed, eventual size, age or prior health issues. We rely on the expertise of our veterinarians and make estimates based on past experience. Also, when you're adopting from a Rescue, you should ask questions! You should always get shot/medication records and the rescue should have had the dog for a bit of time to check for disease. Take the time to educate yourself before adopting. A reputable rescue will have nothing to hide and will answer ALL your questions!!! Please visit our Web Site to see all of the pets we have for adoption. Our site contains information about our adoption process and fees, our application, and answers to frequently asked questions. Please read it carefully before contacting us. If you are interested in adopting THIS wonderful pet, we strongly encourage you to complete our adoption application now. Once we receive and approve your application, we will notify you of approval. The first application to be received and approved will get 1st choice - be sure that your references are available and willing to speak with us. Thank You Visit us at one of our next adoption days. Details are on our site under the \"How to Adopt\" tab. Hope to see you there!",

            "description": "Our girl Faith was left in a kill shelter in KY. She had rescue but they backed out when they heard she was a little too \"interested\" in cats. Faith is ultra submissive and will roll over & give her belly for anyone. There is not a mean bone in this girl's body - but she does have issues with CERTAIN men. She's about 9 years old & plays appropriately with other dogs big & small and is bunkmates with MJ on our site (who is 1/2 her size). We would consider her med energy but has much love to give! Because of her fear aggression when it comes to most men, we cannot bring her to adoption events so an appt would need to be made to meet her. Our adoption fee is $325 and all of our pets come with full vet records. All animals are up to date on vaccinations & dewormed. Unless otherwise indicated, puppies are NOT spayed or neutered since our vet recommends waiting until 6mos of age to do so. Please keep in mind we are a Rescue Group and most of our pups come to us with little or no background info regarding breed, eventual size, age or prior health issues. We rely on the expertise of our veterinarians and make estimates based on past experience. Also, when you're adopting from a Rescue, you should ask questions! You should always get shot/medication records and the rescue should have had the dog for a bit of time to check for disease. Take the time to educate yourself before adopting. A reputable rescue will have nothing to hide and will answer ALL your questions!!! Please visit our Web Site to see all of the pets we have for adoption.

            "description": "Meet MJ! He is a 9yr old beagle/terrier mix. He was found as a stray in KY and ended up in a kill shelter...until we rescued him. He seems to get along with every other dog we have (incl puppies of all ages). He walks well on a leash once he gets over the excitement of being out with you. At only about 40 lbs, he is the perfect sized companion dog. MJ is very smart too and learned to sit for a treat & give his paw within 5mins. His aim is to please :) We find that he doesn't like to be without people in general but that's not to say that he likes all people and is definately picky about who he trusts. The ideal home would have someone around rather than leaving him for the workday and would have some dog training knowledge about how to handle a fear aggressive dog. We can no longer bring him to adoption events since many in the general public do not know how to read a dog's body language (he does give signs when he's uncomfortable). We would recommend a low-traffic household for sure because of the potential fear aggressive bite and someone with experience in dealing with this behavior.\n\nOur adoption fee is $325 and all of our pets come with full vet records.

I take my job of guarding the home very seriously, and I do have a bite history because of this fact. I'm not a cuddly dog, that's just not in my nature since I'm so busy working. While my fosterhome appreciates my dedication and service, they've said that I won't be going anywhere unless it's with someone who has a positive reinforcement training background that has dealt with my 'guard dog mentality' in the past.

            "description": "Meet Allie! Our vet estimates her to be 8yrs old and she has been spayed. Allie weighs about 50lbs. We wanted the vet to check her right eye since it presents somewhat smaller than the left eye. The vet agreed that it was most likely trauma from goodness knows how long ago. Upon testing, she does have limited sight in that eye but nothing that really effects her. She has gone through and recovered from much needed FHO surgery since she had some old trauma to her right rear leg as well as treatment for Lyme.\n\nShe absolutely adores attention from people so we think she didn't have much in her past :( She walks fine on a leash and is housetrained. Occasionally you'll see her with a toy but it's not a standard thing for her. The foster she is with is certain that right now, she is the most grateful dog in the house - her sighs of contentment while getting a belly rub for no reason says it all. While she currently lives with other dogs in fostercare, it took us months for her to accept and trust them. But with slow & steady crate rotations, introductions & limited interactions, she has become part of the pack. Check out our site for an application to make Allie a part of your family and FaceBook for adoption event details. (www.endingthesadness.org)\n\nOur adoption fee is $325 and all of our pets come with full vet records. All animals are up to date on vaccinations & dewormed. Please keep in mind we are a Rescue Group and most of our pups come to us with little or no background info regarding breed, eventual size, age or prior health issues. We rely on the expertise of our veterinarians and make estimates based on past experience. Also, when you're adopting from a Rescue, you should ask questions! You should always get shot/medication records and the rescue should have had the dog for a bit of time to check for disease. Take the time to educate yourself before adopting. A reputable rescue will have nothing to hide and will answer ALL your questions!!! Please visit our Web Site to see all of the pets we have for adoption. Our site contains information about our adoption process and fees, our application, and answers to frequently asked questions. Please read it carefully before contacting us. If you are interested in adopting THIS wonderful pet, we strongly encourage you to complete our adoption application now. Once we receive and approve your application, we will notify you of approval. The first application to be received and approved will get 1st choice - be sure that your references are available and willing to speak with us. Thank You Visit us at one of our next adoption days. Details are on our site under the How to Adopt tab. Hope to see you there! 1/30/21 12:01 PM",

Lila is, happily, heartworm negative. \n\nFrom Lila's foster: Meet Lila - our gorgeous Lila!! She is a very happy, healthy 4yr old that loves to play and cuddle and run - everywhere she goes!! \n\nLila is a special needs pug that has some neurological issues with her back legs. We are not sure if this is due to an injury or birth - be please do not let this deter you from adopting her!! She does not let this slow her down one bit!! The biggest issue is elimations, as she is not always aware of pooping. Lila does squat to urinate, but then hops about 3ft while going. If she is leashed and you hold her, she will finish then move on. She will also stand up when asked! \n\nThis sweet girl is a treasure and we are hoping that someone will give her a chance at a family - she deserves her own family and loves with her whole heart!! \n",

Because of her highly active nature we would not recommend a home with small children.  She was born 6/7/2017 and is a healthy, strong girl.  Rena will get along well with other dogs and people but needs to be introduced slowly. She needs a home without small dogs or cats. Rena's adoption fee is $175 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay and a microchip.

I am selective about the dogs that I like and pretty much just vocal, so if you have another fur kid, meet & greet is necessary! I do pretty well on a leash, crate trained, pretty well potty trained and a loving snuggle bug. I love attention and to be a lap dog. I could be the PREFECT companion. Small children make me nervous, but older respectful ones are okay with me. I have a high prey drive and protective of my space and things, i.e. toys, crate and take small children as a threat. I do not attend events because I am Cujo in a crate and they are too stressful for me. I am a total love and sweetheart for the right person.\n\nAdoption Includes: I am spayed, up to date on core vaccines (5 in 1 in, bordetella & 3 year rabies ex. 03/21), dewormed, microchipped and any health issues we were aware of addressed.\n\nIf Interested PLEASE contact PATCH Rescue Inc. patchrescue@gmail.com or (760) 706-0728\n\nAdopt a Pet Listings =\n\nhttps://www.adoptapet.com/adoption_rescue/93645-patch-rescue-inc-victorville-california\n\nPetFinder Listings =\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/ca/victorville/patch-rescue-inc-ca2487/\n\nAdoption process is verbal interview to determine if we think your family is the right situation for the fur kid you are interested in, application (can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ZDmKaRLnYfbDZLbDN5Y3hYeWM?usp=sharing), once application is reviewed and approved home check. Then we say you are becoming part of the PATCH family adopting one of our fur kids, so we expect follow up on our family member throughout their life!\n\nPlease keep in mind we are 100% volunteer run We do not have a facility, completely foster based, so we all have our real jobs, it could take 24 to 48 hours to receive a response.\n\nThank you for considering adoption to save two lives!\n\n1/31/21 12:13 AM",

All of her babies have been adopted to great homes and now it is mamas turn.  Peebles is sweet and gentle and very obedient.  She is selective with the dogs that she likes but can be introduced slowly and then she wants to romp and play!  She would make a great companion dog.

She does not care for the feline friends. \nJudy's special home would be able to walk her through learning about life as a loved pet and not as a caged creature. She worries when her person leaves the house, but she is getting better at knowing that they will return to her. \nJudy deserves a patient extra loving family that will just be with her and shower her with kisses and hugs.

She is an energetic, vocal and happy girl who enjoys being around her people. She is attentive and intelligent.  Give Stella something to do, and she aims to please. She likes to play and enjoys canine companionship. Stella also enjoys cuddle time with her friends.  She knows her basic commands and would benefit from continuing her training.  Stella's ideal family will keep her active, have large breed experience and make her a central part of the day's activities.",

We are looking for a home where they can be adopted together as they are very bonded.     They love being on a farm and LOVE to go swimming.   Very sweet and goofy natured dogs.    They've lived on a farm and are great off leash, although they do tend to be hunters and will kill small animals.   Cooper will chase deer as well, so care needs to be taken when off leash.  Not trustworthy to be left loose unattended but are wonderful on our pack walks on the property.    They are home bodies and prefer to be at home rather than out in public or at the dog park.     They would also do best as the only dogs in the home.    They've been around cats and are fine if supervised, but having prey drive, would not leave them loose in the house with cats and no one home.   \n\nCrate and house trained.  Good on leash, both know a few commands.    \nFenced yard required if in town. \n\nThe hounds have been with us since they were puppies and would really love to find a place of their own...   Would do best with older kids, over 10.     $400 adoption fee is for both of them together.     Both are altered and microchipped.    VERY sweet dogs!\n\n",

He can get a little over the top, but that's where he needs a strong (not necessarily in strength but helpful) person.  He has been at the shelter for over three years.  ARL doesn't want to set him up to fail so multiple visits with Jeter is a must.  If you think you are his person please call the shelter to have a meet and greet.  He probably would be better as an only dog.\nUpdate:  Jeter was recently (July 2020) featured on Dodo.  Please check out video.\n Jeter was turned over to ARL because he was just too much for them as a puppy.  ARL can't impress on potential adopters enough to research a breed before adopting.  Jeter is now two years old.  He really needs a \"dog\" person who is willing to work with him and take control so he can show his true personality.  He is such a happy boy.   He loves his toys and he enjoys going on runs.  He graduated from the Sheriff's Dept. PAWS program where he learned basic obedience training.  He just needs the right person willing to continue his training and give him a chance to show a family what he can truly be.    My adoption fee is $125-150 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!   And remember that adopting a pet is a life long commitment.",

She just loves to play fetch!  Petie is a muscular girl and is good with dogs her size and larger. She does have a high prey drive and likes to chase small animals like cats and squirrels.\n\nShe is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. Petie was rescued by Lucky Dogs from an Illinois County animal control and brought to Chicago to find a loving family. To meet and possibly adopt Petie, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net for an adoption application. Her adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. \n\nShe is healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and micro-chipped. She is being fostered in Chicago.",

Mix She is such a cool dog :)My adoption fee is on my main profile at our website. I have been given all my age appropriate vaccinations and dewormed. I may need more depending on my age, puppies continue to get their vaccinations and dewormings up to 14 to 16 weeks. If I am a puppy, I will have an appt. to be altered (at our vet) my alter fee is included in the adoption donation fee. I have been treated with Frontline for fleas & ticks. Thanks soooo much for making adoption your first option - so many of my buddies need to get adopted too... so tell a friend to visit our website and help in the goal to have more pups find forever homes. If you are viewing me on Petfinder or one of the other rescue portals - please go to our main website: www.tlcwithpups.com - where you can find our adoption fees and our main profiles.

He has never had a reason to trust humans. Caregivers love him and are helping to build his confidence. He does enjoy a rest in a lap and we know there is so much more to this cute fellow. What he needs is his own home where has a nice routine and people who will be patient with him as he blossoms into the fun kid we know he wants to be.\n\nFor more information go to www.hua.org.",

He is happy in his foster home and loves greeting the many new doggie friends who come and go, but still holds out hope of finally finding his own forever home.   He is very fearful and distrustful of strangers but once he bonds he is a loyal funny little guy who craves attention.  He\u2019s about 6 years old, about 15lbs and maybe mixed with papillon or some kind of terrier.   He has a surprisingly soft silky coat and is gets along well with other dogs.  Goofy will need a calm adult home without a lot of human visitors to help him feel more comfortable. Email njwoof@cs.com if you are interested.\n\nWe do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East next to 5 Star Car Wash (formerly Boulder Car Wash) in Morris Plains (Denville on GPS).  To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions.\nCan't adopt but still want to help this dog?  Click on the \"Sponsor Me\" button at the top of this page to donate toward his/her care!  All donations are tax-deductible and go directly toward the care of our rescue dogs.  Thank you for your support!",

            "description": "Stop! Bama time! I dance to the beat of my own drum but I would really love to have a life long dance partner. My name is Alabama, but all the cool kids call me Bama. I am a 62lb., 4 year old, male, chow/hound/awesome sauce mix.  I am looking for an extremely dog savvy person or couple to call me theirs!  Like all amazing things, I'm not for the faint of heart.  I'm the sweetest, most lovable boy ever, but I've got a lot of fear.  The first year of my life wasn't all sunshine and roses and I've worked very hard to learn not everyone will hurt me.  I adore my people, but I need them to be super strong alphas.  I am very vocal when I'm scared or excited, but when I'm at home just chillin' with my people, I'm total a love bug.  I also promise to always let you know when the mail arrives.  I am house trained, crate trained, know basic commands, and walk well on a leash.  I've never met a treat I didn't love.  I am a very VERY smart boy.  I need structure and routine in order to thrive.  I would do best in a home with a 6ft privacy fenced yard (no apartments for me).  I do not want to live with any children or cats.  I get along with dogs after a few proper introductions, but I would be happiest as your one and only.  I need a strong, confident, loving, calm home without a lot of commotion.  They say the eyes are windows into the soul and anyone can tell after checking out my puppy-dog dreamboat eyes that I'm a darling underneath a tough guy exterior.  I do enjoy taking relaxing walks through the park and romping around the backyard playing with my friend. I am a strong, full-of-life guy who needs someone full of dog training skills, patience, understanding, and love. I want to feel safe and just relax in my forever home, but for that to happen, my forever best friend needs to be a true pack leader.  I cannot wait to find my amazing forever person!  I'm already smiling just thinking about you!\n\nMy adoption fee is sponsored and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit rescueonespringfield.com/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out*",

She is also on heart worm prevention.\n2 Shuz is super friendly and just wants to play with everybody. She does settle down and would probably be fine with an older person or small kids.\n\nUpdate: 5/31/20 2 Shuz is still available for adoption but her caretaker would prefer that she and Sox be adopted together. 2 Shuz is about 3 1/2 yrs old now.",

I've got the spirit of an adventurer and learn new things fast. I like to catch bubbles, play ball, and go on long hikes where we can spend time together.

            "description": "DOB: December 2016\nWeight: 60lbs\n\nThis sweet boy bonds with select people at first, basically like a guard dog. He gets scared of new people and needs proper introductions. We do not recommend him in a home with small kids because he is more on the nippy side with toy and doesn't like grabbing at the ears, face, or tail. He is one that takes some patience and understanding of the kind of dog he is. He is super cuddly and hands down the best dog ever until it comes to first impressions. He wants to get to know you before he thinks you're a friend. He is not recommended in a home with cats or other dogs- you won't want another fur baby with this big ol baby in your life anyways. He loves water, to walk, he is pretty well mannered on a leash. He will stay by your side and even protect you if need be. He has a couch potato side as well and he can be a window peeker (he loves to watch outdoors). He is pretty house trained, but the first few nights he's with you it's natural for a potty accident to occur.  Please call us for more information on him and to schedule an appointment to meet him!",

            "description": "Sam is a sweet but timid dog. With a little patience he would be a great calm addition to the family.  Everything scares Sam until he's sure it's not going to hurt him. Sam does great with other dogs after he gets to know them. He's a little snappy if they are in his face the first week he's trying to adjust to his new environment. Sam is very happy and playful with other dogs after he knows they are not gonna hurt him and he's a little more comfortable in his new home. Sam would do best in a Quiet Home without children/teens.  Even though Sam is a Shy/skittish boy, he warms up slowly. Sam will never be a lap baby but will lay beside you on couch/bed and will let you pet him once he's comfortable and settled.  \nSam has even been known on ocassion to play a quick game of chase and paw at the peoples hand and although they are a few rare moments it shows he at times can feel very comfortable and play with people. Sam is house and crate trained. Walks pretty good on a leash. He absolutely adores his foster dad. Sam is around 3 years old and 30 lbs. \nHe's a terrier mix and is utd, hw negative (tested below detectable levels) and neutered!\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

Faith is not part of the PAWS program.\nIf you are interested in Faith, please complete the online application which can be found at kcpaws.petfinder.com and the application will be forwarded to the group or individual responsible for this family pet.\nFaith is a beautiful sweet Aussie mix girl around 6 years in age. Faith is quite shy at first and does take a bit of time to warm up to someone new, but once she does she's very sweet and loves to have her belly rubbed.\nWe consider Faith to be special needs because she does not walk on a leash. We are unsure what has transpired in her past but any tugging at her neck or collar or even the presence of a leash coming her way terrifies her.\nNeedless to say a fenced yard will be MANDATORY for Faith.\nFaith really is no trouble at all, she is low key and will lounge with you all day on her cushion or the couch. She is not destructive and appears to be housebroken (once she learns the new routine).\nFaith does get along fine with other dogs like most Aussies can be a bit bossy at times. She would do best in a home with older children 10 and up.\n1/22/21 7:16 PM",

            "description": "Meet Gertie\n\nThis 3 year old girl had a rough start in life. A very kind man found her in a ditch on the side of the road in pretty bad shape and we were contacted for help. She had puncture wounds all over her body and she was very skinny. She had to have some oral surgery and bone grafts, but with a little TLC she recovered wonderfully. She was timid and shy, but she put her trust in us and her doctors. Now Gertie is happy and healthy and waiting for her furever home! All she wants is for someone to sit and cuddle with her. Honestly, she thinks she is a lap dog. She is very sweet and extremely\u00a0\u00a0passive with humans. \n\nHowever, we believe that Gertie may have had to fight other dogs for her survival.\u00a0\u00a0We don\u2019t mean necessarily as a \u201cfighting\u201ddog, but in a situation where she lacked proper care and was not fed properly, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You can probably imagine what\u00a0\u00a0type of living environment we are referring to.\u00a0\u00a0Because of this, she does have\u00a0\u00a0fear aggression towards other dogs. For that reason, we will only place her in a home as the \u201conly\u201d pet. \n\nFor more information about adopting Gertie, please visit our website, dareanimalrescue.com to fill out a foster or adoption application. Click on the tab, Foster/Adoption Process and then How to Adopt. Please be sure to read about the adoption process\u00a0\u00a0prior to submitting your application.",

            "description": "IN SEARCH OF A SPECIAL SOMEONE FOR A SPECIAL DOG!\n\nSnugs is a Special boy in need of a Special Someone to give him a Special Forever home. Snugs is 82 lbs. of funny, talkative 6-year-old adoreableness but this goofy, loveabull boy has some challenges.\n   \nSnugs has separation anxiety and he needs his people to be around a good bit. He loves his crate and feels secure there but panics when left alone outside of his crate. His foster mom leaves Snugs crated when she is gone and he is perfectly happy. But this means that his foster and forever people need to be homebodies so he is not required to spend long hours being crated.\n\nSnugs also has hip dysplasia. It is mild to moderate now and AFLAR has him on all kinds of support supplements to slow down the process but it is a degenerative disease and will need to be managed over his life time. He loves his walks and does lots of zoomies in the yard but foster mom is careful to not over excecise him or he will get sore.\n\nSnugs lives with another dog and is dog tolerant. He does not like to share his bones or toys with other dogs and so his foster mom has everyone play separately. He also gets upset at the neighbor dog at the fence and can transfer that excitement to his foster sister so they have separate yard time too. He would be perfectly happy not living with another dog as his people are the most important things in the world to him. He would be OK with another dog in the home if carefully managed like his foster mom does.\n\nSnugs does not like meeting stranger dogs in the street on leash. Particularly little dogs. Little dogs scare him. Snugs acts like he can\u2019t believe they are real and he just wants to stand there and stare at them. He is really just a big baby! Snugs has had a good bit of training in this area and is doing as well as he can. But his Special Forever person would need to continue his training. He packs up quickly with other big dogs though and enjoys pack walks.\n\nSnugs is actually an independent chill little man who likes a few pats and then goes off for a nap or to hang in his yard and watch the birds. He does like his evening couch cuddles though and is blissful when invited up for a cuddle. He is a couch hog though and lies with his big head in foster mom\u2019s lap but takes up the rest of the couch.\n\nSnugs is not wild about the vet or meeting new people. He is good with new friends after a few minutes when he knows you are nice and not going to overwhelm him because he is so cute. Then he will then love you forever\u2026. friends for life! The vet scares him though. He is muzzle trained for vet visits and has done fine with good vets who handle him with confidence and care.\n\nSnugs is a Special dog. Yes he has challenges but what makes him really special is the love and loyalty he gives his people. He always has something funny to say, yes foster mom understands him, and an opinion about everything. He brings many smiles and giggles wherever he goes and is a wonderful happy companion grateful to share your life.\n\nCONTACT: (805) 445-3535\ninfo@allforloveanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Kohl is a red, 5-6 year old, 30 pound boy. He was described by the shelter he came from as a lab/basset, though we think he's a dachshund mix. He is long and has little legs. He was in a foster home after living in a mall parking lot and was named after the Kohl's store. At first he was almost feral, but four months in his foster did wonders.\nHis super foster home was moving; thus his transfer to B&B. He is still shy, but he seems to have a good disposition. He has been doing well with his playgroup- dogs from 10 to 30 pounds plus one gentle Labrador. He has been getting braver with people he knows, and he is obedient about going in and out of his kennel for exercise time. He should warm up with love and attention. It may help to have a dog in the home to show him how to behave.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Here at Adopt-A-Dog, Fry serves the role of class goofball very well.\u00a0Effusive in both his love for his friends and in every experience he has, Fry is one of a kind. He takes to new experiences, such as learning how to play soccer or football, or going for a ride in the Adopt-A-Dog van, with an enthusiasm that cannot be matched. He truly is a unique dog and has most of his human friends saying \"Oh, Fry!\" or \"That's Fry for you\" whenever he does something just a bit more awkward than his counterparts.\n\nA big guy, Fry came to our shelter when his original family could not handle his size. At the time, he had not reached a year old so he still had both growing and learning to do. We began working with Fry on basic obedience and his manners when it came to both people and other dogs. The Fry we have today has come a long way from the Fry we first met, and we know he is ready to show off for his very own family. When making new friends, Fry typically needs a bit more time to get comfortable and get to know someone. Once he has spent some time with you, and has been feed a copious amount of treats, Fry will be your best bud.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0All this big guy needs in a home is a willingness to get slobbered on followed by tons of comfortable places to sleep and stretch out. We know that this not-so-small Fry is ready for his new family.\n\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7",

            "description": "EST DOB: 12/2016\nWeight: 75lbs.\n\nOliver is black and white with Hazel eyes and a curious black nose. He loves to chew his nylabones or antlers and can keep himself occupied with those for hours at a time. He doesn't have a lot of patience for other dogs, and would probably be best as an only pet.\n\nOliver can run like the wind but doesn\u2019t have super high energy. In other words, Oliver can run or play off his energy and then is just as happy to chill out and snuggle. \n\nOliver is very well mannered, house-trained and has good recall. He is very sensitive to correction and a simple \u201cah, ah\u201d is all he needs to stop him in his tracks. He is eager to learn and a pleaser. The only time Oliver gets distracted is when his nose gets a scent of something like a deer. Then watch out! He has leapt over a 4 foot fence in pursuit.\n\nOliver gets anxious when left alone for long periods of time. His human should be gentle and kind and experienced in positive reinforcement techniques. \n\nA note from Oliver: \n\nHey guys!!! My name is Oliver.  I'm basically just a big, lovable, adorable goofball.\n\nEveryone sees how handsome I am, and how big I look, and how mellow I can be sometimes, and they think I'm all grown up. But really I'm just a kid inside! \n\nI like to play with toys and humans! I love to hike! I ride awesome in a car!\n\nI not real crazy about crates, but I'm comfortable in a large kennel space or maybe a gated room. Sometimes I get a little nervous about being left all by myself.\n\nI'm looking for someone special to love me for who I am..\n\nIf you think you could be my family, please email ABetterLifeAR@gmail.com.\n\nI'll be watching for you!!!\n\n~Oliver~\n\np.s. I'm from Morganton, NC and would like to stay close to my friends\n\n\nWe try to limit our travel time for home visits to a two-hour driving range (about 75 miles) from Morganton, NC.\n\nPlease visit http://www.abetterlifeanimalrescue.com/adopt-a-pet.html for an adoption application.\nAdoption fee $100.00",

Lucy has had her DNA tested and the results are in the pictures below. Whoever adopts will receive her dna results. Please note she does have some pit bull terrier in her so you will need to live in a town without a pit bull ordinance.  She is super cute!\n\nLucy is a sweetheart.  She is about 5-6 years old and apx. 52 lbs.  She is very curious as you can see in the pictures but also very eager to please. She is smart and knows how to sit on command and is very eager to learn new things .  She is a active dog. She would need to be a single dog home as she tends to be a bit territorial.  But she is a very loving dog otherwise and can walk on a leash (does pull some)   We always take the fur babies back into our care if for any reason it does not work out.\n\nNOTE FOR LUCY IF YOU LIVE OUT OF STATE TRANSPORTATION TO YOUR LOCATION MAY BE AVAILABLE WITH AN APPROVED HOME STUDY/APPLICATION.

Dylan has many trust issues and has blossomed under Erin and Dan's care, and has decided being with them is the best place for him to stay. \n\nSanctuary Sweethearts at IAMRA are dogs that for various reasons \u2013 usually old age or extreme medical needs, or both - are deemed unadoptable.  So IAMRA will provide them with their forever homes.  We locate the appropriate \u201cfurever foster\u201d home for them, and provide for ALL of their needs, from special food, meds, supplements, and vet visits, to toys and chews and treats and anything else they need to make their twilight as perfect as can be. This of course can be quite expensive.  A bag of prescription or special food alone can be nearly $100. And all of our Sanctuary sweeties need extra vet visits \u2013 and almost always extra treatments and meds for what ails them.  Most if not all are on special supplements, for joint care, liver or kidney support \u2013 whatever each individual dog needs.  Anyone who has had an old dog, knows how expenses can climb in their twilight years. We\u2019ve made a promise to take care of these special senior souls \u2013 most have had not so great lives until coming to us. So it is important that they not only know love and kindness, but also know physical comfort in their old age. Please consider helping to sponsor one of our Sanctuary Sweethearts, or make a one time donation to help with their care. Many thanks to all who help these sweet old souls!",

He is very happy to be out of that scary place and back into a home!\nHis foster mom and dad say Skipper is very friendly and sweet to everyone he meets and is a laid back guy who gets along well with his foster brothers.

Gina would do well in a quiet home. If you would like to make Gina a part of your family or to find out more information about her, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org!\nGINA'S ADOPTION FEE IS $150\n\nThe shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up.

She craves love and attention, as she really aims to please and wants to work for you! She would need slow introductions with other dogs, as she is an alpha female, and not recommended for a home with cats or other small animals. She would take very well to training and it is highly recommended. Because of her hound nose, she would not be allowed liberty until full trained, and she loves to run and might wander off a track! It would be best if inappropriate addition, if Rose had a tall fenced yard.\nIf you would like to make this sweet girl a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org\nROSE'S ADOPTION FEE IS $160The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

She needs an experienced owner, lots of exercise, both physical and mental. She needs to be a ONLY PET. She will need training, but is very intelligent and would take to training with zest! She would make a great dog for SCENT DETECTION, agility, flyball, lure coursing and obedience. You name it, she would love it. She is CRAVING a job! Not recommended for a low activity family and requires a fenced yard!\nSTORMY'S ADOPTION FEE IS $100.The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!\n\n1/27/21 9:56 PM",

            "description": "MEET FREDDIE!! This handsome man is about 9-10 years old. He appears to be a purebred black lab. He is a very gentle, calm, and mellow boy who is looking for a forever home to spend his golden years. Freddie gets along great with other dogs and appears to leave cats alone, though he has not been around many cats up to this point. He walks well on a leash and knows some basic commands. Freddie loves car rides and going for walks, and he\u2019s never met a stranger! Freddie really doesn\u2019t like to be alone, so he needs to go to a home where someone can be home a lot of the time. He would be perfect for an older couple looking for a mellow companion. \n\n**Freddie does have a medical condition that makes him a special needs boy. He is prone to getting perianal fistulas, which require long-term medication to control. At this time, Freddie receives medication once every other day. He continues to do very well as long as he gets his medication regularly and has not had any issues recently! For more information on perianal fistulas, here are some helpful links: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/diseases-of-the-rectum-and-anus/perianal-fistula\nhttps://www.acvs.org/small-animal/perianal-fistulas \n \nIf you would be interested in meeting/adopting Freddie, please visit labradorfriends.com/how-to-adopt to fill out an adoption application, or email labfriendinfo@gmail.com if you are already approved!\n \n",

            "description": "Preston is without a doubt one of our most lovable dogs (and we have many)! We scooped up from county after he was adopted out and then returned for a very minor skin ailment. We saw the heartbreak in his eyes, and were adamant this guy get his 2nd Chance at a FOREVER home. He is great with people and other well-behaved dogs. He's one of the best huggers we have out at rescue. While a forever home would be preferred, Preston is also available for fostering. He is a wonderful family dog with an adorable, loving personality.  He would do best in a home where he was not along for more than several hours at a time, due to some separation anxiety.\nhttps://2ndchance.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=10643666",

She likes to explore and is eager to play with any new friends. She is vivacious and full of spunk and would need some training in walking on a leash. Found as a stray in a rural area, in horrific shape, she is now healthy, vetted and ready ! Flora is available for foster or adoption ! She would be best as an 'only pet'.

Very suave and sophisticated, Cuba is a nice guy who sits happily for treats and walks well! He may even be a Mambo King, but you'll have to stop in and meet him to find out! His adoption fee is $150. Cuba is neutered, current on shots, has been wormed, is microchipped and treated with monthly flea, tick and heart worm preventive. Adopted on 7/11/17, Cuba was returned 2/26/19 because he doesn't get along with other dogs. Cuba will fare best in a home with an experienced owner and as the only pet.",

I've learned so much since beginning my journey.  \n\nI LOVE people and really love to play with dogs.  I am still learning that not all dogs love me as much as I love them.  I am also learning to read their cues better and not be too strong in my play.  If you have a ball of any kind, you will instantly be my best friend. Toys are another favorite thing of mine - especially kong type balls. No cats, bunnies or hamsters for me as I have a high prey-drive.\n\nPart of my training is learning to share my toys and not guard my food.  I am still working on this and my adopter will need to continue my training to help me be the best dog I can be.  \n\nMy perfect family will take me on a lot of adventures.  I would do best with an active family that'll continue to work with me on my training and give me a lot of exercise. I don't require an adopter with a fenced in yard, but I sure would love one to run around in. \n\nMargo would not do well in an apartment/condo/townhouse. She needs space to run!\n\nTo determine if you'd be the right fit for Margo, please email: Paul@4pitssakerescue.com\n\nPlease fill out an application on: www.4pitssakerescue.com to adopt me.",

A man in Tucker, GA really needed our help as he rents a room in a house and had 16 Pit Bull/American Bulldog mixes. This included a new born litter that was just days old. All 16 of these dogs were living outside and none of them were fixed, vaccinated, or de-wormed. This man was overwhelmed and he was unable provide for the dogs so he gladly signed over 14 dogs and we vetted the 2 he wanted to keep. Gweeb was one of the pups from the litter that was only a few days old. Gweeb's mother was a fantastic mom, but his litter surely would have died living outside in those conditions with her being so malnourished.\nABOUT GWEEB\nThe best word to describe The Gweeb is awkward. He was the runt of a litter of 7 puppies and is awkward in everything that he does. Gweeb lives in foster care with multiple other dogs and is fantastic with them as he is generally submissive. He is a real goofball and is sure to clown around and keep you laughing with his awkward antics. He is very emotionally attached, attentive, and loves to be with people. This guy is a serious cuddle-bug! He will chase a tennis ball through the yard, but hasn't quite learned how to fetch yet. Sometimes his top lip will get stuck and his bottom canine tooth will peek out in the silliest ways. Gweeb is housebroken and crate trained. He would love a family that he can love hard, one that he can entertain, and one that enjoys a good laugh.\nPhoto Album of Gweeb: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.523012947756876.1073741849.162554320469409&type=1&l=a6dc542985\nMore VIDEOS of Gweebie: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h3EyXeE1eQfeZ_sLZ7hx8r0\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org 1/30/21 3:35 PM",

After spending 16 days in AC, her time was up and she was on that day's euthanasia list at Fulton County. We pulled Tonya with only 2 hours to spare on April 16, 2013 and she has been living with us ever since.\nAt the shelter, Tonya had an injury to her rear right paw and a horrible case of kennel cough/upper respiratory infection. Animal Control gave her medicine to kill the maggots that had filled her nasty wound on her right rear paw. She has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and she tested negative for heartworms. Tonyas foot has also completely healed and she is a happy, healthy girl.\nABOUT TONYA\nTonya obviously knew what it is like to live in a house as she immediately jumped up on the couch and made herself at home. She is one sweet girl. She jumped right up into the car, enjoyed her bath, hoarded some bones, ate her dinner, and went into her crate on her own to go to sleep.\nNot only does Tonya have the best pittie smile in town, she has the silliest, most amazing ears. This girl is packed full of personality and she loves toys. She is crate trained, housebroken, loves people, loves to play, and is good with kids. Tonya would love an active family. She would be a great hiking companion and would love a family to teach her new tricks as she is very smart. She is very confident and is all about making her people happy. Tonya would do best as an only dog and she it not suited for a home with cats. Tonya is a strong, active lady and she will require a secure, 6' privacy fenced yard where she can play with her family and maybe chase a squirrel or two or a person who is strong and willing to work on her leash manners. She is such an incredible lady and is sure to put a smile on your face!\nPhoto Album of Tonya: http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.510779675646870.1073741838.162554320469409&type=1&l=6c417d0a67\nMORE VIDEO of Tonya: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h2coMpCnT6JTTmibLxTjmWP\nTonya has her own FACEBOOK PAGE: https://www.facebook.com/FindAHomeForTonya\nOur adoption fee is $300.

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Gender: Female Estimated Date of Birth: July 16, 2008 Size: 96 lbs Location: Dallas, GA\nRESCUING GINGER\nGinger's owner died on Mother's Day. She was alone in her backyard with family members attempting to care for her. No one could get near Ginger as she was exhibiting extremely aggressive behaviors. Jason was called to help and was able to wrestle Ginger into his van to transport her to our vet. Once at the vet, her demeanor changed completely she was sweet, giving the staff kisses and allowed them to bathe her and even cut her nails.\nGinger had already been spayed. Her leg was broken long ago and has healed funny, but our biggest concern was the mass on her rear end. We took her to GVS for evaluation. They did an ultra-sound that determined it is non-cancerous and the vet thought he could remove the lipoma. He wanted this mass removed ASAP as there is a concern that it would hinder the functionality of her urethra. The mass was removed on July 26, 2013 (it was probably the size of a cantaloupe!), and she has recovered wonderfully. As if Ginger couldn't catch a break, she was also heartworm positive. She has since been treated and is heartworm-free.\nABOUT GINGER\nGinger is a very large, low-energy gal. She is house-broken and crate-trained. She is cautious around new people and will keep her distance, but given a little space, she will warm up quickly. Once she is comfortable, she will give you sweet little kisses. She has a few doggie friends in her foster home and is crate-trained and housebroken. She does not require daily exercise and is more than happy to nap the day away at your side. This house-hippo is a very easy girl to care for and she has a lot of sweet love to give!\nPhoto Album of Ginger: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.553269571397880.1073741865.162554320469409&type=1&l=487f816a7e\nMORE VIDEO of Ginger: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h03Ny1M-dlrPQ_P4CObqE0A\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

They have been inoculated, neutered, and given flea & tick and heartworm prevention. After their vetting, they were brought to an excellent kennel, where the owner not only took phenomenal care of them, he also made sure they got lots of fresh air, exercise, and socialization. He told me that these puppies are super-sweet, and with patience and some training, they will all make awesome pets! Billy (yellow lab), Bob (red lab), and Tango (black lab) are coming up today, Sun, 7/9, from AL, to become Yankee-pups. I can't wait to meet my babies!! If you are interested in any of these puppies, please call Sindee. 914-299-3700.",

Looking for LOVEE!!?? MITCH is young, athletic, and quite a thoughtful guy. He likes long walks in whatever setting you prefer, long distance jumping, dog boxing, and fine dining. His favorite meal is anything he can swipe counterside, with a side of dog food. So he is definitely \u201chigh end\u201d. He prefers muddy gravel roads, but long walks on beaches or concrete will do. He works out daily and would love a buddy to do so with. He\u2019s also extremely social, so any kind of 4 legged dog friends are welcomed! He\u2019s not really a cat guy and prefers to stick with his own kind. He absolutely agrees to pose with whatever selfie you\u2019re thinking of that day, and will also work for treats. Let us know if you\u2019re interested in kicking your single gig for this hunk! We definitely have the hook up!! Do you LOVE to laugh? Do you love the outdoors? Do you like tricks (not your ordinary tricks!) Do you need a little \u201chappy\u201d to rub off onto you???MICH is your guy! I have NEVER seen a dog make such a fool of himself, have no shame, love every other dog and person, and just love life SO much.....and also be homeless. Mich has been homeless for OVER a YEAR now. Mich was surrendered to the shelter in July 2016 at 5 mo old. With hours left before euthanasia, the litter was rescued. His other 3 siblings got adopted right away, and he was left behind. He's looking for a family who would enjoy an outside, sometimes inside pet...have children who love to play fetch.and have no kitties! He can be an inside dog because he loves to snuggle and watch tv or sleep in the bed, but he is an outdoor dog at heart. This boy runs and runs and runs circles around the yard with his rope, ball, bone, stick, anything he can find in his mouth! He\u2019s a ham!! He needs a wide open space or woods to run, where he can explore! He's hard to keep fenced in, so if you have open room for him to run, that's what he needs the most! He loves to go explore but always comes back home :) He responds very well to commands such as sit, down, wait, and ok. He loves to go on car rides and outings! He\u2019s wonderful on the leash and welcomes strangers with a wag! His favorite place in the world is the dog park! He\u2019s super trainable and hasn\u2019t attended formal classes, but training classes will be included in his adoption! He\u2019s fairly small, around 35lb, and won\u2019t get any bigger. He is up to date on shots, neutered, and microchipped. If your family is looking for an addition or you\u2019re looking to be loved unconditionally, amused daily, and willing to give a baby a second chance at a good start in life, Mitch is who you are looking for!!! Mich is looking for an adopter OR FOSTER!! His current foster can no longer keep him, as she has too many pets to give him the attention he deserves. He is kenneled too much and needs OUT!! \n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting, please go to www.thepitstoprescue.com \n\nTo adopt Mich, fill out our application here! https://form.jotform.com/42655372023147 To foster Mich, fill out our application here! https://form.jotform.com/42655245603150\n",
