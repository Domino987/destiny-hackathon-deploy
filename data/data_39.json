I'm just a young southern gal ing for a loving home!! \nI've been looking for love in all the wrong places!\n\nNATURE\nOther dogs: loves playing with others\nCats: curious about them but very little exposure\nKids: loves but can knock down small one\nAdults: love attention, very energetic\nAdditional comments \n\nTRAINING\nHouse broke: No but she doesn't mess up her kennel\nPad trained: only exposed to pads after spayed. She did well. \n\nLeash trained: Yes but also loves to run free\n\nVACCINATIONS\nUTD \nSPAYED\n\nThis sweet carefree girl has been living at a very rural shelter in Mississippi with not lots of chance of being adopted.

She had an owner but sadly her owner went off to school and had no one to watch her so she went to the shelter. Sissy took it hard for a bit but is now back to being her silly happy self. She loves people and loves attention the most. She does well with other dogs with no issues and walks pretty well on a leash. She will need a refresher course on house manners but listens well to direction and treats of course. She is now totally vetted and ready to come to WI and find a forever home this go around, a home to love her forever. If you are looking for a medium sized friendly girl she is ready to fill the spot for you.

            "description": "We can't wait for you to meet Rosie!\n\nRosie is an adorable pit bull terrier mix, aged 3 1/2 years old. Many may remember her from last summer. She was adopted, but recently returned.\n\nShe has a pretty red coat and perky ears! Rosie has the sweetest personality and you can tell how loyal she is just by looking at her eyes! \n\nRosie has gained a touch of weight since she has been gone, but other than that, she is a happy, healthy girl. A home where she gets to be someone's special companion would suit this girl just fine!\n\nRosie tested negative for heart worms and is now receiving monthly preventatives for fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and heart worms. She is also fully vaccinated and spayed. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Rosie, please call us at 580-252-7387 or send us a message on Facebook.For more information, please email Stephens County Humane Society at schs@att.net, or call us at 580-252-7387 (PETS).

He loves walks and enjoys meeting people and other dogs. He has lovely manners and knows basic commands; sit, come, stop, and stay!",

I am potty trained, crate trained, and all around pretty chill.\n\nI still young and get the zoomies to everyone's great amusement. I am very well behaved around children. I REALLY love them but I'm not prone to jumping on them or knocking them over.\n\nI have not met a person I didn't like and I do great with dog, horses and goats. I love car rides and chillin on the couch. I sits for a treat but if U toss it to me it is most likely going to hit me between the eyes and bounce away. Mom says this is cute too but I'm learning. I'll catch it one day soon.\n\nI am a ready made dog. An adopters dream. Hurry cuz I won't last long!\n\n*Possible BSL.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

I don't mind being in a playpen or secure area if you need to do stuff around the house. My foster mom is teaching me how to ring a bell to go potty outside and when I do, I get these amazing salmon treats that I just love! I'm spunky and sweet and would love a family with kids or even other pets! Do you think I'd fit with your family?

I am about a year old and working on putting on weight (my story is not a happy one until I made it into rescue, but you wouldn't know it because I'm a sweet girl who loves people!). My foster mom guesses I'll be around 35 pounds once I've put on what I need (I'm about ten pounds lighter right now). I am super smart...within a few days I learned sit, that we potty outside, and how to use the dog door (which is kind of like Harry Potter's platform 9 and 3/4). I'm now bursting through the dog door to play with my foster sister outside, and bursting back in to see my foster mom. I sleep quietly in a crate at night and get along well with the dogs and people in my house. I love to snuggle and think maybe I'm just a big lap dog. Take a chance on me... we all need some good Karma!\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Colorado bio: Balboa (Bo for short) is a low-maintenance, mature dog who loves to lay around and chill (and if you can be bothered for a belly rub life is even better). This gentle guy has good mannershe knows not to beg for food when his people are eating and he does not bark at passing cars or pedestrians. Though he is fine with lounging much of the day, he does enjoy getting out for short walks where he can see and interact with other dogs. He likes the snow too, and weve noticed that he picks up his pace in the cold. Bo is a great companion to have around as you work from home because hell rest near your desk and be quite content with an occasionally petting, treat, or belly rub. His calm, sweet demeanor suggests that this handsome guy (so well-dressed with his white tuxedo) would be good with children and other dogs.\n\nTexas bio: Balboa is a very easy going, sweet, couch potato! He is happy to spend his time just chilling next to you on the couch, sometimes with his head in your lap. While in a new environment, you may notice a little separation anxiety until he gets settled in to his new home (as with many dogs). He appears to be house trained as he will let you know when he needs to go outside. He doesn't beg for human food at the table. He enjoys walks but likes to go at a leisurely pace. What does this mean? No pulling! He just walks along at a nice slow walking speed, with the occasional stop to sniff around. He's just an all-around good boy! \n\n \n\nBalboa is a love bug and an old soul, you can feel it when you're around him, he deserves someone very special.\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Cassey, and I am the small package that good things come in! I may be tiny, but I have a big, adorable personality. I love to play with my 4 foster sisters and am learning to entertain myself (though I would much prefer to be around other dogs or people!). I dont know anything about cats or small humans, but Im sure I would love them (and of course they would love me!). When I get sleepy, I happily go put myself in the corner (or in your lap) for a nap. At first, I didnt understand why I had to potty outside, but as long as its not too cold, or I have friends outside to play with, I am getting better at something my foster parents call potty training. At nighttime, my foster parents put me in something they call a kennel, and its the perfect place for me to decompress, relax, and sleep. They even let me sleep in there all night, no interruptions. Its great! I am a little shy, so I hope you wont mind giving me a little bit of time to get to know you. I promise I am worth your time and patience. If youre looking for the perfect, small, and loving dog, I cant wait to meet you!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Im spunky, happy-go-lucky and super friendly with everyone other dogs included. I especially love being close to my foster mom, showing her affection with lots of licks and tail wags. Shes nicknamed me Curious George as I love following her around to see what shes up to.\n\n \n\nDo you have lots of toys for me to play with? Squeaky ones are my favorite, and if theres one of those around, its usually in my mouth. I love going for walks and am good on a leash. Im also house-trained, although I dont enjoy being crated at night Id much rather cuddle with my foster mom (but she wont let me up in bed with her!).\n\n \n\nAt 40 pounds, Im the perfect size not too big, not too small, juuuuuust right! My best home would be one with lots of activity and kids, and other dogs would be fine, too. I have to warn you, though, Im an attention hog who always wants to get the most cuddles and pets from my humans. A yard would be great to play in so that I can chase the resident bunnies and squirrels.\n\n \n\nIf youre looking for a friendly, happy dog that just wants to give and receive love, please apply to adopt me. I cant wait to find my forever home and I hope its with you!\n\n \n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He'll even paw for it! Piglit is super smart too. In a short time he has learned some basic commands like \"sit\" and continues to work on others. He is a very fast learner. Piglit has good leash manners and enjoys going on walks to do his business and sniff out the city. Hes curious, playful and a little goofy. Piglit will make you laugh but mostly he just wants to love you and to be loved!\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

            "description": "Introducing Melody! She is an adorable young lady looking for a home to call her own. Melody is approximately 7-12 months old. She is believed to be a cattle dog/heeler mix. She is a medium sized young lady at approximately 25 pounds. We do not know Melody's background but she does need a home that can help her be the dog she is meant to be. Melody is a bit shy and needs an adopter who can help her overcome her fears. In her foster home she has come a long way from the dog that hid in the back of a kennel and didn't want to come out. She is dog friendly with dogs her size. She is happiest outside playing with her friends in the fenced in backyard. She is crate trained and doing well with potty training. Melody has tremendous potential to be an outstanding dog...she just needs that understanding home. Is that home yours?\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

            "description": "01-26-21 UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER:\n\nHandsome Jughead might be 10 years old but he has a young heart and feet. He is calm indoors and loves food toys. Outside he is active and has plenty of energy for long walks or running\u2014he does well on the leash. He\u2019s great with children and friendly toward other dogs. Jughead has that lovely hound bark but he uses it very rarely and only does single barks. He loves cuddles and affection and sleeps well through the night.\n======================================================\n\nMeet calm, sweet senior Jughead. This boy spent his whole life of ten years with one family as an elderly person\u2019s companion. Sadly, she was moved to a nursing home and obviously couldn\u2019t take him with her! Black and tan coonhound Jughead was heartbroken but has been nothing but sweet and kind to everyone in the shelter. He is a medium sized boy at 60 pounds that loves being petted and going for walks. He will probably greatly enjoy walks in his forever home but will also be a great couch potato companion. Looking for a family who understands hounds and really wants to help a senior dog live out his golden years on top! He will need decompression time and time to get used to his new family\u2019s schedule and expectations. He is good with dogs, cats, and kids. He is not a jumpy dog which is great when there are younger kids around. To apply for Jughead please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thank you!!\n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

            "description": "In December we received a call stating that due to Annie\u2019s human having unforeseen health issues over the last several months, she is no longer able to care for or give her the attention she needs.  Wags to Riches quickly responded and Annie was placed into one of our amazing foster homes.  \n\nSAY HELLO TO ANNIE\u2026Annie is a 9 month old America Bully/Shepherd mix who currently weighs in at 57 pounds.  Annie, through no fault of her own, is a bit of a wild child and will need a human who is an experienced dog owner.  Annie needs a family who will invest time into her and her training needs.   Her Wags foster is currently working with a trainer to get her on the right track and we know that continuing this training after her adoption will be the key to Annie\u2019s success in her new forever family!  Annie is a very smart girl who is eager to please.  She loves training as it gives her an outlet for her energy.  Annie is a fun, spunky gal who plays well with others.  She will thrive with an active family!\nHere is a few more important things about Annie:\n\nPersonality:  She is described by her foster as a fun, playful girl who has a big personality and high energy. \n\nUniqueness:  Her ears have a personality and mind of their own.  She has a gorgeous and soft grey coat with brown speckles and brindle throughout. \n\nPotty trained: YES- but does go out every 2-3 hours and once over the night.\n\nCrate trained: YES- she sleeps in a kennel at night and during the day she has stayed in the kennel for up to 4 hours. \n\nDogs: YES- she would be great with another dog her size and one that is playful to help Annie work off her energy.  NO to older, small or low energy dogs as Annie could be very overwhelming to them.\n\nCats:  NOT ADVISED- Due to Annie\u2019s energy level and want to play a little rough/ puppy behaviors. \n\nKids:  YES & NO- Due to Annie\u2019s size and energy level at this time, we would advise children over the age of 8 years old with some knowledge of dogs.  Annie tries to be in charge and can push boundaries so younger kids would not be advised.\n \nMiscellaneous: Annie loves car rides and currently is working on walking on a leash and basic commands.  She does get excited, pulls and gets distracted but she is a large size and still a puppy so her training will make a difference and is extremely important.   \n\nAs mentioned Annie has had minimal training to this point so her manners need work but the potential is there and with training, the sky is the limit for her!!!    It is important to remember that Annie is still a puppy (under a year old) and weighs in at almost 60 pounds so she will need strong, dedicated and consistent humans in her life.\n\nIf you think Annie may be the one for you, please go to our website at www.wagstorichesanimalrescue.org and fill out an application to adopt.  Please be sure to include a vet reference as regular vet care is important to us for the health of all our adopted dogs. With approval and a $295 adoption donation, she will be ready to accompany you on all of life\u2019s many adventures.  Annie is spayed, microchipped, fecal tested clean of internal parasites and up to date on all her vaccinations.\n",

He\u2019s currently around 5 lbs and expected to be in the medium size range when fully grown. This little guy is working on kennel and potty training. He loves playing with his foster kid and dog siblings even though they don\u2019t pay much mind to him. After that his next favorite hobby is napping sometimes we think he thinks he\u2019s a cat!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Meet Athena! This pretty Shepherd or Husky mix was surrendered by her owner to the rescue. He recently lost his home and car and was headed to another state and couldn't take her with him. He contacted our team for help right before he left town, giving us little time to plan for her arrival. Some of our team members in SC had worked with him in the past, rescuing 14 other dogs off his property that were being kept outside. They tried to secure Athena, but he wanted to keep her. Athena was fortunate to be an inside dog and considered part of his family, but he was by no means a responsible owner.\n\nAfter a two-hour transport to safety, Athena was seen by one of our partner vets before she went to her new foster home. She's being fostered with two other dogs and has been respectful of them, but slow to warm up over the first week. We think she's the type of dog who needs a gradual introduction and time to build rapport, and trust her new environment. Her people skills are fantastic, and she connected with her foster mom right away. We think she would love to be an only dog getting all the attention, or best paired with a more laid back dog. She did live with cats in the past, so a cat home would work too.\n\nAthena is an active dog who can be high-energy when it's playtime but enjoys relaxing on her dog bed. She enjoys going on walks and can play fetch all day! She does pull some on the leash, but leash walking is new to her and she's still learning. She isn't bothered by traffic or noises but likes to check out other people or dogs walking by.\n\nAthena's foster mom, Hanna, describes her as a confident and snuggly pup. \"She's not timid in new situations or fearful of noises and will enthusiastically greet you by jumping up to hug you with her front paws. She has great house manners, is potty trained, and took quickly to her crate. She is very friendly and social when meeting new people.\"\n\nThis fun and affectionate dog needs an active owner or family to take her on new adventures. Her social skills make her ideal for road trips and social outings with friends.\n\nAthena will be coming to N. Va on 2/6/21. Apply today!\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Shepherd/Husky Mix\nGENDER: Female\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 49 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 1 year old\nCOAT TYPE: Short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/spayed/microchipped/\nLOCATION: York, SC\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nInitially shy in her foster home, lovely Lady now feels happily at home there. Acting far younger than her seven years, she's best buddies with the resident dog, loves going on walks with him, and running and playing with him in the backyard. Very affectionate towards her fosters, she could cuddle with them all day on the couch, but when she senses an adventure's at hand, she's up and exploring the possibilities. Highly intelligent, she responds well to training and redirection, walks well on leash without pulling, yet remains fearful of cars passing by. Respectful of her feline foster friends' space, she's well mannered, free roams when alone and is fully housetrained. Now for lovable Lady to thrive, she needs patient adopters with a consistent routine who will introduce her slowly to their other dogs if applicable, and assure that she's not only adored but kept mentally and physically satisfied fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet,\n\nthe next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives!\n\nA home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $300. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nWe want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time.\n\nOur adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

            "description": "MEET ROSCOE!!!!!\n\n~Roscoe is 6 years old but still such a sweet little puppy! He's looking for a home as an only dog and no cats. He loves to snuggle and be glued to your side so hopefully a home where he's allowed on the couch! He adores kids (7 and up, only because of his size and excited wiggles) and just want to play and be close to them! So a family with or without kiddos would make him so happy either way! He sleeps next to the bed in his own dog bed and does sometimes sneak on the bed but overall does really well in his bed! Roscoe has a lot of energy so if you like to get out and walk or hike he's your man! He will need continued work on a leash but has had lots of training and does well. He's not much of a camper though, we think he doesn't like the dark very much, but day trips and car adventures he's ready for! He is kennel trained and also dog door trained. To start off I would work on kennel training then slowly build trust to roam and have access to a dog door. He needs tall fences and preferably not the metal see through ones. He currently has a dog run set up he can access at all times and then whole yard roam when someone is home. He loves to sun bathe and enjoy the patio. Roscoe loves his indestructi-bone, he could chew on that for hours! We will make sure he gets sent with his! Overall this boy is the sweetest and goofiest boy! He talks a lot, and if he's not apart of a conversation he will make it known that he has something to say! It cracks us up! He's a people dog and simply needs your snuggles and love to be happy!\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or email info@underdogaz.com",

            "description": "Meet Taco Bell!\n\n9-year-old Taco Bell entered Bonita Shelter as a stray. He did have a microchip, but sadly his owner failed to come forward. So, we made Taco Bell a Frosted Face on January 22nd! At the shelter, he didn't always like being handled, which isn't unusual under these circumstances. and it makes Taco Bell the perfect candidate for a two-week Frosted Fling.\n\nFor the next two weeks, Taco Bell gets to decompress in a home environment. We won't be surprised if Taco Bell becomes much more comfortable being picked up and handled. His Fling Mom reports that he is already playing fetch and nudging her when he wants to be petted. Be sure to watch the videos to see how adorable Taco Bell is!\n\nCheck back soon for the next update on Taco Bell!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/25/21 KG",

            "description": "Update!\nRJ had his enucleation surgery and is so much happier. He's even more playful and affectionate than he was before the surgery. He's a really terrific boy who is lovable, brave, resilient and so smart!\nRJ is a seven year old Dutch Shepherd mix. He was found wandering on the mean streets of South Los Angeles by himself, and taken to a high kill shelter. We pulled RJ out of the shelter to give him a chance at a good life. RJ has PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy) and cataracts and is blind. He doesn't let the lack of sight affect his quality of life, and is a happy guy who finds his way around just fine. This brave boy is only hesitant about one thing: traffic noises.\nRJ has a surgery coming up to remove both eyes because he has blown up a case of glaucoma in both eyes. He will be much happier, and pain free afterwards. He'll be available for adoption as soon as he is completely healed.\nHe's a very affectionate boy who really doesn't ask for a lot, but he sure does like belly rubs and cuddle sessions. He enjoys every meal, and loves the raw bone-in treats that we give him every day. He's content to make himself comfortable on his big cushy bed, and will alert to sounds that he's not familiar with. We always announce ourselves when we greet RJ, and he always has a nose to the air - his other senses take over for his lack of sight. He knows every bush and tree on his walks, and likes going out for short adventures. He likes car rides, too. We guide him with our voices.\nWe're searching for an owner that knows that sometimes dogs that aren't perfect CAN be perfect. RJ is always cheerful, gentle and doesn't know a bad day. He learns very fast when taught, too. He greets every day and person with a smile on his face. He's a really amazing spirit.\nIf you would like to meet this remarkable boy, please complete an application for adoption: www.deafdogrescueofamerica.org/adoption-application.html",

To him, age is just a number!  Farmer passed his behavioral assessment with flying colors, has a smile for everyone he meets, and enjoys playing with toys.  Not only does he fetch, he'll also drop the toy for you to throw it again.  Farmer is good with other dogs but hasn't been tested with cats.\n\nInitially, Farmer tested positive for heartworm, while in Alabama but he underwent two additionally tests with our vet and tested negative each time.  If you would like to meet this happy older boy, please go to our website at www.rescueahart.org and fill out an online adoption application.  \n\nAll HART dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines, including bordatella and rabies.   They are heartworm tested and on preventative for heartworm, fleas, and ticks.   If you are interested in any of our pets, you must complete an online dog adoption application   at www.rescueAhart.org .   The application will put you in touch with this wonderful dog's foster family so you can schedule a meeting.   Thanks!   www.rescueAhart.org",

He is currently 36 pounds, current on shots, dewormed, Nexgard, etc.  He has shorter legs and is a solid boy.  His momma is a smaller dog at only 30-35lbs.  We don\u2019t foresee him getting very big.\n\nGrayson is mostly potty trained and crate trained.  He\u2019s been around children and kitties.  He\u2019s also been around horses but is scared of them.  \n\nGrayson can be a little shy at first but quickly gets over it.  He would probably do best having another dog in the home to help build his confidence a bit.  He\u2019s a playful pup but also affectionate with his people.  He does great on car rides and would be a great fit for a family with an active lifestyle.\n\nYou MUST complete an application at RescuedPups.com to be considered for a meet and greet with Grayson.",

Hope is a 1 year old, 55 lb black Lab.  She is very sweet, smart, great with kids and dogs, has a healthy appetite, is housebroken, knows a few commands (sit, stay), comes when she is called, obedient, and is learning to walk on a leash.  She still needs training/guidance with leash walking because she does has places to go and will pull. Hope loves toys, running, and playing; she's still a young pup after all :) Hope will need a minimum of a 8' fence.  She recently raised her little family and is ready for her own new beginning in life! \n\nIf interested, please fill out an application at www.camorescue.com \nCAMO Dog Rescue",

He is a little timid at first, but he longs to be cuddled with his person and he is very playful and active. He is approximately 6 years old and in good health. He would do best in a calm adult home. He does not do well with cats. If you want a cuddle bug partner, Gizmo is for you!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting  please fill out an application at our website www.gobeyondrescue.org/adopt. Our adoption fee is $350 and includes spay/neuter, microchipping and up to date vaccines. We Adopt in the SF Bay Area Only.",

            "description": "Handsome Roscoe is a 2-3 year old, 70-ish double merle Aussie with no obvious hearing or sight impairments.\n\nRoscoe is a very charming and loving boy. He loves to play with other dogs, and he loves to fetch the ball (haven\u2019t tried frisbee yet).  This young dog knows all the tricks -- sit - stay - paw \u2013 but he could really use some manners and table etiquette.\n\nHe becomes quite possessive over \u201chigh value\u201d items (meaning your things, food and bones). He is not typically a chewer when left alone;  However, when seeking your attention - he will grab something he shouldn't have and start chewing.  Roscoe can become dominant \u2013 meaning snarling and snapping if he doesn\u2019t want to give up an item, but can be persuaded to trade for another item (food / bone).  This behavior is a work in progress. Roscoe's original owner did not properly establish who was the boss.  He has made some strides, but being challenged is something new to Roscoe. It will take some time to overcome his attitude.\n \nAussies are bred to be brave so they can dominate and control large herds of animals \u2013 but they also need to be taught when to turn that behavior off. Aussie's are typically very smart and they learn quickly. Roscoe would do best in a home with herding dog experience.\n \nRoscoe has a lot of potential, but needs the right handler. His behavior improves after a good run or romp with another dog. It is recommended that his home have an active playmate even though it may be necessary to feed the dogs separately. \n\nRoscoe has a strong prey drive \u2013 cats or smaller animals might not be a good match. He does seem to be good with dogs of any size.\n\nWith his herding instincts, it's best that he go to a home where children are 12 or above.\n\nThis poor sweetie tested positive for heartworm and Lyme, but that hasn\u2019t affected his happy personality one bit!  Lyme is a tick borne disease that is not contagious to other dogs or humans but will remain in his system, throughout his life.  Roscoe may have an occasional flare-up which would be indicated by joint pain/inflammation, limping, lethargy and possible loss of appetite.  Typically a dose of antibiotics is enough to make the disease go dormant again.  To help control the Lyme, Roscoe will need a yearly Lyme vaccine.  Should he have multiple flare ups in a short amount of time, his kidneys could be affected.  Lyme has become more prevalent in the southern states, and many dogs with this disease have lived long happy lives!\n\nHeartworm disease is easily preventable with heartworm preventative, which Roscoe unfortunately did not receive from his previous owner.  It is treatable/curable but will take several months to do.  Hence, we're looking for a local foster to adopt home for Roscoe.  HART will cover the cost of his heartworm and initial Lyme treatment but Roscoe would be much more comfortable being in a home instead of boarding at the vet's office.  \n\nIf you would be interested in fostering to adopt Roscoe, please go to our website, at www.rescueahart.org, and fill out both a foster and adoption application.\n\nAll HART dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines, including bordatella and rabies.   They are heartworm tested and on preventative for heartworm, fleas, and ticks.   If you are interested in any of our pets, you must complete an online dog adoption application   at www.rescueAhart.org .   The application will put you in touch with this wonderful dog's foster family so you can schedule a meeting.   Thanks!   www.rescueAhart.org",

I\u2019m house trained and crate trained, although I\u2019d rather not be in my crate and I\u2019ll let you know about it for the first few minutes or so I\u2019m in the crate by barking and whining. But I usually settle down. At night I sleep beside or under my foster parents bed, but I would totally love to sleep in bed next to you. I get along with other dogs. I haven\u2019t been around cats ???, so not so sure I\u2019d like them. And children would be new for me too, maybe an older child would be best because sometimes I like to jump and run and I\u2019d hate to knock one over or hurt them. Did I mention I like my ball and playing fetch?? I do ok on a leash, but have a tendency to pull, but I bet with some time and training I could be better and maybe even be a good running partner!\nIf interested in adopting me into your family, please go to http://www.purple-paws.org\n and submit an adoption application.",

I'm a young German Shepard female with lovely, soft, white fur, pointy ears, and the BEST smile! I'd be happy to be your sous chef! I am very smart and already know \"sit\" and \"shake,\" and how to use a doggy door. I'm also potty and crate trained. I am a great mix of \"let's play\" and \"let's snuggle,\" but definitely need someone to make sure I get plenty of exercise playing fetch, going on walks, or hanging at the dog park. But once the house is calm and winding down, I'm ready to take a snooze on your lap or my doggy bed. I do great with medium- to large-sized dogs, and currently live with a 75 lb. male, and a 51 lb. and 48 lb. females. I haven't been around smaller dogs, cats, or kids, though. Give me a chance to get to know you, and I know we'll be the bestest of best friends in no time! Fill out an application so we can meet! ...",

When the shelter reached out to us about Malina, they described her as \"a ball of love\" who is great with both dogs and people and just wants to cuddle or roll over for a belly rub. We made Malina a Frosted Face on January 22nd! It seems like she may have some hip or leg issues that could be age-related, but we'll know for sure after Malina goes to our vet soon for an exam, full body x-rays, and bloodwork. This newbie is a full-figured gal at 83 lbs.\n\nOur volunteers and staff are giving Malina lots of love and attention as she settles in to the routine at Frosted Faces.\n\nWe will add more information about her\n\nsoon, but in the meantime, you can stop by during our next Open House to meet her!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\n1/22/21",

She plays with toys and jumps like a jack rabbit! She's amazing with all of the other dogs and shows no aggression at all.",

Unfortunately, before it was her time to leave from her original location, she and another dog got out and the neighbor shot them.  Poochie was lucky, she made it back.  Her partner in crime did not.  After a thorough exam at our vet clinic, it was determined the leg was shattered and she was in extreme pain.  Removal of the leg brought her immediate relief and she has adapted extremely well.  She zooms around the yard and gets around very well.  She is kept inside either in a crate or small enclosure and let outside to potty or longer if the weather permits.  She will bark at strange things when outside but is quiet when inside unless she whines to go outside.  She is learning to ride in a car but still timid about it and generally just lays down until arriving at the destination.  She has never been fond of a leash so still needs some slow training.\n\nShe is non-food aggressive with people, dogs or cats.  She should be fine with young children except that she might bump into them as she still learns to navigate around on 3 legs.\n\nHasn't she got the greatest smile?\n\n",

Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** No other obvious issues found during vet exam *****\n\nTemperament: Maverick is a very sweet and loving boy who enjoys long walks and playing with his puppy friends. He is very social and gets along great with people and other dogs (he came from a home with another big dog who he adored). He does NOT do well with cats, however, and he has never met a small human, but we have a feeling he would love them. He is a playful pup, but at the end of the day, he loves to cuddle up with his human and relax.\n\nWhere did he come from: He was surrendered to our rescue when his owner no longer wanted him.\n\nAdoption: ***** $324.75 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 65 lbs.\nApproximate age: 1/3/2019\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

Loves to play, run and all typical breed related activities. Tug of war and fetch are favorite activities. He does need some watching if left alone and things are laying out tends to get into them ..but remember he's young! He has done well with a small dog in the home and greeting other dogs out on walks. Would love to be an only dog and snag all the attention but a female might be the best if he lives with one. We would prefer a fenced yard!!! He loves to be outside! He needs an active house that will walk him and take him on adventures. He's been up skiing and loved the snow! If you want a dog to particiate with your outdoor adventures this is the guy!!\n\n$400 adoption fee (includes microchip, deworming, vaccines up to date, and he's been neutered). We accept venmo, cash, checks \n\nApplications must be received before meets are set up. If you rent, please be ready to provide proof you are allowed to have a pet. \nCOVID UPDATE: We are not currently doing adoptions to Canada unless you are in a position you can cross the border. We're sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nWe do not EVER ship dogs. \n\nTo apply please go to www.mainstreetmuttrescue.com and click on Adopt. If you click her picture the application should come up. \n\nYou can also apply at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/MSMR/Dog (this will come up as generic so please try to use the one on our website first!",

            "description": "Meet Kendall!! She is two years old and just the happiest girl you\u2019ve ever met! She is 60 pounds. She loves loves loves loves people. This poor girl was living in a shelter for 6 months before she finally found rescue. She is adjusting to life in a home and is doing really well. She is crate trained and working on potty training and basic manners. Unfortunately, she tested positive for heartworm and is currently going through treatment - all treatment is covered in her adoption. It will require her to be kept calm for the next 6 months. She\u2019s a pretty calm girl, and doesn\u2019t mind chilling next to you while you\u2019re working or staying on her crate. She\u2019s currently in a foster home with another dog - and she tolerates him, but doesn\u2019t really love him. This may be from her being in a kennel for so long. They coexist fine, but I think she\u2019d be happiest as your only dog. We are cat testing her this week. \n\nKendall really just wants someone to give her a chance. She is fine with a house or apartment, and doesn\u2019t require a yard. She prefers to be inside with you any chance she gets. She is VERY CUDDLY- and would sit in your lap and be as close to you as possible if she got the choice. This is an amazing girl - fostered in Denver, Colorado! \n\nIf interested in Kendall please send in an application as the first step. www.soardogs.org\n\nAdoption donation required. This covers altering, DAP series vaccinations to date of adoption, Bordetella Vaccination, Rabies vaccination if over four months, Microchip, Deworming, heartworm test (if over 8 months), monthly flea/heartworm prevention to date, grooming, full veterinary examination, and temperament evaluation. Please e-mail us for more information or go to our website https://soardogs.org/adoption-application for an application. Thank you very much!\u00a0\n\n\nAll SOAR dogs go through a ten-day quarantine period to ensure they are healthy, before being adopted. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis, but screen applicants in order to find the best fit for our adoptable dogs.",

He is crate trained, house broken, has house manners, sleeps through the night, enjoys his walks and rides perfectly in the car!\n\nWith all of that, what else can I say about Booker? He loves his people! Booker would do perfectly with someone who works from home. Due to his size, older children are recommended. He is currently in a foster home with two huskies and he is absolutely dog-friendly.\n\nBooker would do best in a home where he has a canine friend, preferably a confident female. Booker is a low energy lab, but he does get excited when he knows we are going for a walk or a ride in the car, but he is easily calmed. He knows his basic commands too! He is 99.9% PERFECT!\n\nIf you are looking for a new pal that is tall, dark and handsome, look no farther than Booker! To inquire about Booker contact Texas Sporting Breed Rescue at retrieveafriend.org .",

Once we receive it, we'll forward it to the foster family for follow up. We are 100% foster based, so we don't have a facility. Review the process FAQ at our website.\n\nAdoption applications can be found here: http://labrescuefresno.org/available-labs/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fees Adult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00 Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00\n\nRusty - Yellow Male, Age 1 Year, 80 lbs\nIf you are ready to ensure that your New Year's Resolution is met, and you are ready for a larger-than-life hunk of love, just in time for Valentine's Day... then look no further than Rusty! He will ensure that you are out of bed every morning ready for a brisk walk, a jog, a sprint, or a marathon!\nThis bundle of Labrador energy is a healthy, young, 1-year old male that sadly has not had any structure in his one year on earth. He was adopted with good intentions, but he became a backyard dog, and became bored and alone and then too much to handle. We hear this tale all too much, and young Labradors are a real commitment of time, training, structure, and consistency. They also like to be included with their people, and usually have other doggy playmates. Rusty is no different!\nSo Rusty is putting out his classified ad to find true Labrador lovers before Valentine's Day, he will be ready to meet his forever people.\nRusty's personal ad will read:\nSeeking an active home life with a family that will make me a priority. Will need to be a home with lots of exercise, brain games, obedience classes, maybe a personal trainer, and more! I am learning to come indoors, learning to understand what a kennel and a crate are, and meeting new dogs and learning to play and behave like a nice boy. I would like another dog my size to play and romp with. I am ok with kids, but I am a big strong boy that doesn't know how to control my boundless energy, so older children are best. I am not interested in living with cats, I say forget the cats and spend more time with me! I have a strong voice, healthy lungs, and can bark when necessary to let you know my needs... hope you are ready for a big hunk of Labrador if you pick me!\nRusty will require a home that is ready to work with a young dog with boundless energy, muscle, and brawn. He would benefit from a home that will provide boundaries, and work on progression with crate training, indoor time, play manners, leash skills, and more. He is not recommended for a 'first time' dog family, as he is a strong big boy with a lot of power.\nIf your New Year's resolution is to spend more time outside, hiking, biking, running, walking, and looking for a companion that can log some miles with you, and would love to be your companion, then apply for Rusty! A training plan and commitment for obedience work is a must for this boy!\n\nApply at www.labrescuefresno.org, applicants will be screened and responded to accordingly. Dogs are adopted out based on their needs, not a first come process, please be patient with our volunteers as they respond to applicants.\nIf you are interested in adopting through Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno, you must first fill out an Adoption Application located at our website www.LabRescueFresno.org All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines including rabies; flea/tick topical drops, heartworm tested and microchipped. Thank you for opting to adopt!!\nAdoption FeesAdult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00",

My owners were allergic and could no longer care for me.\n\nThe nice people at DRUT found me a foster family to help me work on my socialization issues. At first I was really nervous to meet the other dogs and barked and growled at them alot. Now I realize the other dogs are pretty cool. I can't say much for the cat at the moment. I have only met him a couple times, he keeps on running away and hissing when I chase him.\n\nAnyway I have really enjoyed exploring the yard at my foster's home and would like to live in a home with a fully fenced yard. I do require a sweater or jacket when I'm out, I do not enjoy being cold. I'm very sweet and love head scratches and cuddles.I would love to cuddle up with the family on the couch for a family movie night. I like to sleep in a dog bed on the floor next to your bed at night. I could be left out when you're not home or in a kennel. Yes, I will bark and cry when you leave, however it's only because I miss you so much. I just thought you should know just in case you share walls with neighbors, I can be pretty loud.\n\nI am very loyal and will love you and your family forever. I love being around adults & kids and enjoy meeting new people. I can't promise that I won't be nervous around new dogs, however I will try my best. If you are interested in me please submit an application.\n\nhttps://www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/applications/adoption-application/",

He is currently working on his obedience training and would benefit from continued training once he finds his forever home.  Bentley is not aggressive towards other dogs, but tends to prefer to be on his own.  Due to his size and energy levels, Bentley would do best in a home with older children and no cats.  \n\nThis pet is current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, and will be microchipped at the time of adoption.\nVisit our website at: www.awlrescueme.com\nYou can also see all our pets at: www.petango.com\nCall the shelter at 330-539-5300 for additional information",

Piglet's ACL has now been repaired and she is just waiting for the perfect \"forever home\".\n \nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IN ITS ENTIRELTY TO SEE IF PIGLET COULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR YOU. \n\nPiglet would be a wonderful companion for a retired person or \"work from home\" dog parents who want to make a sweet terrier a part of their daily life.   She would be fine with another small, calm canine sibling although we suspect she'd relish being the center of attention.  \n\nPiglet is completely housebroken and rarely barks.   She is very affectionate and loves being with her people.  She enjoys short walks and has never met a stuffed toy she didn't like.  \n\nPiglet's future home must be one that is committed to exceptional veterinary care as she may require physical therapy, laser therapy or even accupuncture for her surgical leg.  Piglet is also a bit \"porky\" (you'll pardon the pun) and like so many of us this time of year, she needs to stay on a healthy diet!\n \nIf you are interested in adoption, you will find out application at http://www.cairnrescueusa.com/.../www.../adopt/frm_adopt.php.  \n\nWe do not match dogs on a \"first come, first served\" basis; rather we strive to make the best match for each dog.  Out of state applicants are welcomed, however, once approved for adoption it is the responsibility of the adopting family to travel to the foster home.\n\nPiglet is UTD on all shots, spayed and microchipped.",

            "description": "Apply on our adoption application at leadrescue.org. We do not adopt out of state. We only adopt in Illinois and within Illinois, 50 miles from downtown Chicago.\n\nInstead of waking up to singing the theme song of One Saturday Morning and all the cartoons that I hope most of my generation remembers, I get to wake up to the \u201crescue song\u201d:\n\n\u201cI have a friend whose friend\u2019s daughter can\u2019t keep her dog.\u201d\n\u201cJust surrendered at the shelter for being a puppy.\u201d\n\u201cOwner wasn\u2019t expecting it to have this much energy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s old, so they don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI found a dog, what do I do next? Can you take it?\u201d\n32 Facebook tags/notifications\n\nAnd these aren\u2019t even messages from the fosters who have our dogs in LEAD. I really love not waking up to an emergency lol. But even though this can be a lot for the average person, I signed up for this when all I wanted to do was save some helpless doggos. I just didn\u2019t think it\u2019d go so far, so fast.\n\nWhile my 4 month old son was practicing the most dreaded infant task-tummy time-I was messaged about a 5 month old Pittie Beagle mix. She was found by a family, kept for 2 months, and eventually they realized they couldn\u2019t do it in the long run. So they brought her to the shelter, where we felt if she got to stay 2 months out of there, we couldn\u2019t let her sit another 2 months wondering what\u2019s going on. I sent the hold immediately and resumed my son\u2019s torture.\n\n\u201cCatch her if you can, Pepper Ann\u201d because I have a feeling she won\u2019t last long. Pepper Ann is as Taylor Swift would call, a Lover. She is a growing 34 lb pup who loves cats, dogs, and kids, filled with happiness, playfulness, and cuddles. She loves to play tug of war but settles nicely when the war tugging concedes. Although she despises the crate and doesn\u2019t really understand that the grass or yellow snow isn\u2019t just for show, we know she\u2019s a smart girl who will catch onto pottying outside with the right teacher. Her best bet would be to have a home with a yard to let her out as often as potty training takes but if you prove to us you don\u2019t mind having to bundle yourself up, getting all sweaty in your puffy coat and putting on her booties cuz the salt on doggie paws freaking sucks, at least 10 times a day, an apartment might be ok. Or an apartment with a dog run might be the real ticket seeing how there\u2019s like a million pee smells just doused in the grass.\n\nPepper Ann is, in our eyes, so lucky. Yeah sure she whines and barks in the crate and isn\u2019t fully potty trained. But when a 5 month old puppy is HAPPY, excited to meet people and other animals, and doesn\u2019t seem to be scared of her own shadow, it means she hasn\u2019t lived a bad life so far. She wasn\u2019t tainted by the terrible things many other dogs have gone through. Pepper only knows good and positivity, which like my son, only knows too. To him, I\u2019m the best thing in the world...besides his bottle. We want Pepper Ann to stay innocent forever.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog another family unfortunately couldn\u2019t keep but that means you get to shoot your shot, please apply for Pepper Ann at leadrescue.org!",

            "description": "Apply to foster or adopt at leadrescue.org. We only foster and adopt in Illinois and within 60 miles of downtown Chicago. \n\nIn need of a foster or foster to adopt for Wonton. \n\n-Very dog friendly! Pretty playful and excitable and will do great with another fun dog. Would be a great dog park dog!\n-Deaf but it doesn\u2019t stop him!\n-Very treat and toy motivated so training him while he is deaf should be easy.\n-Not fully housebroken but goes out every 3-4 hours. Can hold it overnight.\n-Hates the crate but can put him in there while out.\n-Can be a bit mouthy but he is a 1 year old puppy who can easily be distracted by his obsession with toys and treats!\n-Sweet and friendly.\n\n*******************************************\nDeaf dogs can do anything hearing dogs can do, except hear. \n\nCaptain Obvious, sit down.\n\nWhen we are looking to add dogs into LEAD, we do have criteria. Primarily, do we have a foster and dog friendly? There is a much longer list that will bore you, but those are mainly the points we need to make sure we align.\n\nWhat struck us about Wonton were 3 things. First, this is a face more than a mother could love. He is definitely going to be the dog people ask what he is mixed with which if you love talking about your dog already, add Wonton to your life. Secondly, he\u2019s fun size with Bassett Hound like paws and a can do attitude. He loves a good time even when everything is closed. Wonton finds the sun at the end of the rainbow. And lastly, he is deaf! Those big floppy doppy, droopies hide his only secret.\n\nWe do not view deafness as a bad thing or any reason to not take on a dog. In fact my own dog, Tum Tum-a LEADer alum-is also partially deaf...or better yet selective hearing especially when she\u2019s being a bit naughty. His handling video showed him to be goofy, spunky, and absolutely in love with every dog he met. So putting everything together, we took this lover boy.\n\nWonton is some kind of 1.5 year old Lab/Pit/Beagle mix and we are looking for someone to FOSTER or ADOPT him. We would love someone who has read up on hand signal training and a pocketful of treats or a basket of toys ready to be demolished. This dog is so food and toy motivated, we see no reason why Wonton couldn\u2019t learn. He even throws his own toys in the air because he just can\u2019t get enough. These both will be helpful in his jumpiness and puppy mouthiness. Better yet, if you also have a playful dog who needs a buddy going at the same speed, Wonton is DOWN.\n\nEven though he can\u2019t hear, Wonton is not at all skittish. But with anyone hard of hearing, it does take patience to get their attention. I say if he is sleeping, put a treat by his nose and he\u2019ll wake up easily and happy! Wonton, although deaf, he can howl/whine/bark and he does so in the crate. So either you don\u2019t crate him or you live in a single family home where that won\u2019t bother anyone. He is still young, so for housebreaking, he goes out every 3-4 hours but can hold it overnight! Just don\u2019t wait too long or he\u2019ll leave you an expected surprise.\n\nOverall, Wonton doesn\u2019t let his situation make or break him. He doesn\u2019t know you can hear, so he just thinks this world is pretty damn peaceful! And hey, we all like some peace and quiet RIGHT NOW!

He is a happy guy who is currently 3-4 months old (still has his puppy toofers!) and 35lbs. He\u2019s shy but loves his humans and is a cuddle bug. You can tell that he has not had a lot of social interaction but he does warm up and is relatively submissive with other dogs. Because of his lack of socialization, DJ has learned some early resource guarding. While great with kids/other dogs 95% of the time, he protects his things, including your bed if he is allowed up (growling, no incidents of biting). He will lunge at other dogs to drive them away. Since he is so young, this is easily and quickly fixed, he just needs to learn that he does not get to make the decisions and if he claims something, he loses it. We have already seen improvement in the few days we\u2019ve had him. We are looking for a foster home that can help this wayward young laddie go from a sweet, submissive boy 95% of the time to one 100% of the time. If you are interested in fostering, we do require you to be local to the DFW area, have a house with a fenced yard, where he will be an inside dog and won\u2019t be left alone for long hours. While we think he will eventually be wonderful with kids, we need a house with no kids under 12 until we can trust him completely. One by One Pet Rescue is a Flower Mound based 501c3",

            "description": "Name: Bobby\nSuspected Breed: Siberian Husky\nApproximate Age: 3-year-old\nApproximate Weight: 75lbs\nPersonality: Confident, smart, and outgoing\nObservations with Dogs: Needs proper introduction to new dogs but seems to do well once introduced \nObservations with Cats: Not good with cats\nObservations with Kids: Not yet tested\nCurrently Living at: Foster Home in the DMV area\n\nHi! I'm Bobby (otherwise known as Robert, Mr. B, or Bob for short). Check out my instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/boop_its_bobby/\n\nBobby is a gorgeous, black, and white Siberian Husky. This 3-year-old fluffy boy weighs 75lbs. He was rescued from a shelter in PG County, Maryland. Bobby is food-motivated and smart and already knows several commands including \"\"paw\"\". He enjoys being close to humans and is social and outgoing. Making new friends is one of Bobby's favorite things to do and he's generally a happy-go-lucky kind of guy. He is currently being fostered in the city and loves going out to explore, sniff, and see who's out and about. Unlike some huskies we've met, Bobby hasn't proved to be overly vocal so far and is not a big barker. \n\nTrue to the husky temperament, Bobby is strong and athletic. He loves being outdoors and would make a perfect hiking or running buddy. The cold weather doesn't bother Bobby one bit and seems to put him in a very good mood - after all, his breed hails from Siberia! He needs lots of exercise and would thrive with an adopter who would run with him or give him off-leash playtime in a yard or a dog park. In turn, he will help you to stay fit and will snuggle up next to you while you work or watch TV. \n\nLike most shelter dogs, Bobby may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS' fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog. Bobby is a confident boy and needs a proper intro to new dogs. With a good introduction, he seems to do well with dog friends. He cannot live in a home with cats or small animals, however, because like many huskies, he has shown that he has a prey drive.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350. If you are interested in adopting Bobby, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/.ABOUT US & IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPlease note that you must use our official adoption application in order to be considered for adoption. Applying through other sites (i.e., Petfinder) will not work. The following are our applications:\n\nDog application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=1\nCat application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=6\n\nDC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.\n\nOur shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and are completely transparent about any known issues prior to adoption finalization. \n\nABOUT DC PAWS RESCUE\n\nOur rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based dog and cat rescue in the DC area. We rescue locally from Prince Georges County, MD, and from rural shelters in the south (presently Pickens County, Anderson County, and Greenville County in SC, and Raleigh County, WV).\n\nWe partner with a local rescuer in Pickens County, SC, who saves adoptable cats and dogs from the three area shelters. For the animals in this rural area, rescue is a critical lifeline, and often the only lifeline. Our rescue partner not only works with DC PAWS to save as many dogs and cats as possible, but she has also established a successful spay/neuter program in the community to decrease the number of homeless and unwanted animals over the long term.\n\nFOSTER AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFosters make it possible for DC PAWS to save and care for homeless, neglected and abandoned animals! To learn about fostering dogs or cats for DC PAWS Rescue, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/volunteer/fostering/foster-application\n\nSPONSOR AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFor any of our animals! Sponsors help us provide critical medical care, food, boarding, and other support for animals facing euthanasia. Individuals who sponsor a dog or cat receive special recognition on the animal's profile. Sponsorships can also be made in honor or memory of a loved one, and you may designate to whom DC PAWS Rescue should provide notice of your gift. Sponsorship levels of $250 and $150 include \"\"naming rights\"\" for a future dog or cat (respectively) that we rescue.\n\nTo learn more about sponsorship, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/donate/",

Please do not e-mail asking additional questions about this pet. I will update this dogs' Adoption Profile as I am able to assess this dog and know more about this dog if this pet is not adopted beforehand. \n\nMy Rescue does specialize in rescuing abused or neglected pets, so most have some fear issues. Especially of new people...\n \nI post updates on the pets in the comment section on each pets' post in our Facebook group. To see his/her progress, go to: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1405138936478168/\n\nAdoption includes:\n- Initial Vet check\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Up to date on Vaccinations \n- Microchip \n- Voucher for a future Free office visit to the Vet\n- 50% off any Optimum Wellness Plan\n- 30 days of free pet insurance (in case something comes up after adoption)\n- Collar \n- Harness *\n- Leash\n- Other surprise goodies from Safe Haven\n- Other coupons from Partners\n- Available Paperwork: Spay/Neuter records, Vaccination records, Vet records, Micro records, etc...\n- Continued Support: Safe Haven will be there for the lifetime of your new adopted pet. If you ever have questions or concerns, we will always be there to help. Our goal is for you & your pet to live happily ever after! \n\nPLEASE NOTE: All of the pets at Safe Haven receive basic training when they come to us. What each pet learns depends on how much time I have had to work with them, & if that pet has any additional issues that need to be focused on first.\n \n\nADOPTING A CAT OR DOG IS UP TO A 20 YEAR COMMITMENT! THEY ARE NOT OBJECTS THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF WHEN THEY BECOME INCONVENIENT. THEY ARE INNOCENT LIVING, BREATHING ANIMALS WITH FEELINGS THAT DEPEND ON YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF, LOVE, & PAY FOR EVERYTHING THIS PET NEEDS FOR UP TO 20 YEARS, THEN PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR AN APPLICATION.\n\n\n* Safe Haven STRONGLY believes that collars should only be used to hold their ID or as decoration. A dog can slip out of collar. Which becomes a problem if you are trying to restrain your dog, & it comes off. Also, attaching a leash to a collar puts pressure on the neck, which is one of the most delicate areas of the body, & could hurt them. For these reasons, Safe Haven includes a harness with every dog adoption to ensure the safety of the dog. A harness distributes the weight on the chest & shoulders. It also has a handle on the back that you can grab if need be, without hurting your pet (EX: Dog falls off your boat, just grab the handle & pull your pet back in with no harm done. With a collar, you would have to strangle your dog when pulling your dog in). Also, a dog cannot slip out of a harness if it is fitted correctly, so it is much easier to restrain them.\n\n\n*******\n \nFAQ: \nQ: Is this pet still available?\nA: The Adoption Profiles are taken down the same day the pet is adopted. So if you see this pet posted, this pet is still available. The only exception is our Facebook page where the profile stays up, and the pets are tagged as \"Adopted\". Updates are also posted in the comment section of each pets' individual post on our Facebook page for Safe Haven Animal Rescue of AZ at  https://www.facebook.com/groups/1405138936478168/  .Once on the Facebook page, you can type the pets name in the search box to easily pull up all the posts on that pet.\n\n \nQ: I don't see a phone #. Will someone please call me?\nA: Everything needed is online. I have found that online is the most efficient way to get all the work done. In the past, when I posted my #, my phone rang off the hook all day. So I spent the whole day on the phone, with not much work to show for it at the end of the day. Again, everything needed is online.\n \nQ: How do I adopt this pet?\nA: Your first step is to fill out an application. Please e-mail and ask for one at Safe_Haven_Animal_Rescue@live.com  \n \nQ: Where is this pet?  \nA:  This pet is being fostered in a private home.\n \nQ: I like what you are doing & would like to help. Would you be open to a partnership?\nA: Absolutely! I am open to anything that helps care for the animals &/or saves more lives! Please e-mail me at Safe_Haven_Animal_Rescue@live.com and give me details about what you have in mind.\n \nQ: How do I become a Sponsor?\nA: Thank you!

He is house trained, walks nicely on the leash and loves to accompany you for a car ride. A curious, gentle, and kinda goofy guy, Wilson just loves hanging out with you and being part of the family.\n\nHe loves to play with toys, especially plush stuffies, and enjoys a game of fetch. He's playful and silly, but he is also quite low energy and quiet around the house.\n\nWilson, like a lot of dogs, LOVES food and treats. He is a smart guy and you can see his little mind always working, trying to figure out what you want him to do. We're sure with patience and treats, you could work with Wilson to help make him an even better version of himself.\n\nWilson has what his foster mom calls his \"happy feet\" - he does an adorable little dance whenever she comes home, or gives him a treat. His foster mom tells us he is genuinely a happy dog that has so much life and love in him. Anyone would be lucky to have this guy be a part of their home. He wants affection, he wants love, and he wants to be a part of someone's life.\n\nWilson is 4 years old, 63 lbs, and ready for his forever home. Please visit www.liveloveanimalrescue.org to fill out an adoption application.",

            "description": "MEET HOWIE!!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4522600.\n\nHowie is a shy guy until he gets to know you and then he will come up to you for pets and lovin'. Howie was brought to the shelter by a good samaritan who said he is crate trained and went right to sleep after he got into the crate. He likes to ride in the car and he did well with the finder's two dogs in the home. Howie has done well on a leash and he likes to go to the play yard and explore. He did well when introduced to other dogs but he does get startled easily and will bark at another dog if he gets startled. He loves to wag his tail when he's happy.\n\nHowie came into the shelter with skin conditions and needs to see a full service vet to determine what he needs to get healthy. He can sometimes appear insecure and just needs to gain his confidence with a great adopter in a new home. If you can help Howie and give him the attention and love that he needs in a new home, please bring the family and come and meet him today! If you have any dogs at home now, please bring them with you to meet Howie.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Toby likes to play with toys, loves to go on walks, he walks great on the leash. He makes the best Hiking/Walking/Jogging buddy!!!! Toby is looking for a home that will continue to work with him to be the best dog he can be. He needs to have a home with a backyard. Toby needs to be your ONE and ONLY PET in the home......he is friendly, loving and a goofy boy!\n\nRead about my day foster trip with my volunteer friend::\n\nOMG! I was so excited that my friend was taking me out on an adventure trip. She picked me up, and I jumped right into the car, and off we went. She says I ride very well in the car, love to stick my head out the window. Our first stop was Papago Park, I jumped out of the car, and off we went. I was taking in all the smells. I walk really well on the leash, I didn't react to other dogs, I didn't care about the ducks either. People riding bikes, skateboards didn't bother me either. We saw lots of people with dogs and kids, it was really exciting! We walked up mountains, came across water, didn't care for the water much. Later another friend met up with her day foster doggie, and we all continued to walk all over the place. It was a long fun 7 miles. My friend says I'm the perfect hiking/walking/jogging buddy!! I hope my new family will enjoy these fun adventures too.\n\nOur next stop was a yummy place called McDonalds. I got a special treat, a plain hamburger and a ice cream cone, it was so yummy!!! Then it was time to head back to boarding. I don't handle the boarding place very well, it stresses me out. I would really love to have my own family to love me and I can love them back. Will that be you??\n\nNo apartments/condo/townhomes\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com. He is with Freedom Brothers Rescue, but you can fill out the application on this site. Feel free to text 480-359-7109 with questions.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue. Different policies and fees may apply.",

            "description": "Jax is an approximate 8 year old mixed breed fella!   Sadly,  Jax joined us after his person passed away.  Jax took it real hard.  He didn't eat for days.  His world has been turned upside down.  Poor baby!\n\nWhen Jax was adopted, his owner was told he was a pit/weimaraner mix.  We are thinking that he looks dane or greyhound to us!  When he runs, his ears go back.  He is such an aerodynamic fella!  \n\nWe received a bit of information from Jax's previous owner.  We were told that Jax is protective of his person, especially in small spaces and the home but easily makes friends otherwise.  Jax needs exercise.  A fenced in area to run would be great.  Jax is extremely intelligent and would really like a job if you are hiring.  If he doesn't have one, he takes to sorting trash.  Gross!  Someone has to do it!\n\nWe learned that Jax sits funny for treats.  His 'sit' is like a little back leg hop.   It is so cute that the volunteers just can't resist giving this boy extra treats!  If you stop petting Jax, he will let you know by inserting himself under your hand.  Jax has never lived with another dog, but appears to want to play with some of the other rescue pups.  His former person never trusted him around cats.  Jax would probably do best in a home without kiddos or other pets.  \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this fine fella, please visit our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application!  Jax is waiting for you!",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nSkylar (Lab Mix) came to us homeless, so we don't have any background information. He is ready to find a home and family. Skyler is an energetic, young boy who will need plenty of safe exercise preferably in a fenced yard. His estimated DOB is 2/10/20. Skylar weights about 25 pounds and has a bit more growing to do. We can not be sure if Skylar is house trained.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with an approved application, first served. See our adoption procedures, our available animals, and complete our online adoption application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nSherrie came to us as a stray who had been hit by a car. We don't have any other background information. Her badly broken leg has been repaired, and she is more than ready to find her forever home. Sherrie is a sweet, beautiful girl that is not too shy to demand affection. She will require a fenced yard where she can enjoy playtime and potty breaks safely. Sherrie's estimated DOB is 8/1/2018. She weighs about 50 pounds and should be done growing.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

            "description": "This charming little guy is 8 year old Alby and depending on how you look at him, you could say retriever or you could say dachshund but we'll sum him up as totally adorable. We actually have no idea what his breeds are, but those are our best guesses.\n\nHe joined an Ontario shelter when his family no longer wanted to care for him,  but he went on a hunger strike while in the shelter, so being the compassionate shelter they are, he went home with one of their staff members to be fostered. \n\nThen love happened, for both of them.  Kindred spirits. But alas, the felines of the family revolted and as all good things often do, this love affair had to end. \n\nSo, we welcomed 24 pound Alby to Mattie's Place.\n\nHe's a character this one. He loves to eat \"stuff\". Whatever he can hork down his throat, he will. That's what landed him in the shelter. A tussel to get something out of his mouth resulted in a bite to his owner.\n\nHe doesn't however guard items.  He just tries to eat things, and isn't happiest about giving them up.  It sounds like guarding, but big picture is, it isn't, as it's only occasional items he wants to eat.\n\nHe dislikes, strongly ....  Dogs. Cats. Kibble. Vets. \n\nHe loves, strongly ... Cuddles. People. Walks. Snow. Car rides. \n\nWho's perfect? He's not. But neither am I, so we can't judge. \n\nHe occasionally limps on his left hind leg.  The shelter vet and our vet couldn't find a reason why and it seems to not bother him beyond an occasional mild favouring. His front legs have \"out toeing\" which could be elbow dysplasia, as his legs are very short and squat and typical of a dachshund disposition.  His front legs do not pose any issue for him, but he does have a weird little skip, hop, limp on the one right leg.  It's not anything we would do surgery on, as we don't see it as a difficulty for him, but should it become an issue down the road, but would not be covered under insurance, as it's noted in his records and will be pre-existing, so keep that in mind if adopting. His back leg is not noted in his records anywhere. \n\nWe know we'll find forever people for him to cuddle soon. It might even be you reading this, that Alby is waiting for!\n\nNo kids. No dogs. No cats.  Hard no's and non negotiable.  He's also not a dog for a first time dog owner.  He's an amazing boy, but you need to bring experience to the table to adopt Alby,\n\nA country home where he doesn't have to run into other dogs would be best, as the sight of other dogs really stresses him out and he is incredibly vocal and reactive when seeing them and meeting them would likely not go well.\n\nHe gets very vocal when he's displeased (check out the video in his profile) or when he encounters another dog, so avoidance for now is the best option for Alby.\n\nHe would do best working with a professional trainer to help him overcome this reactivity and overall anxiety.  \n\nHe's also not a fan of being alone, and can exhibit anxiety, so a home where someone is there with him most of the the time is the best scenario for Alby, to keep him as happy as he can be.\n\nThe shelter had him medicated for his stay with them, because of his stress levels being so high, but he does much better once settled into a home and we haven't had to medicate him at all in foster care with us at Mattie's Place.\n\n___________________________________\n\nFROM HIS FOSTER MOM & DAD:\n\nAlby is long and short and positively adorable. \n\nAlby loves pets, walks, and cuddles on the couch. \n\nHe is the most loving dog, always looking to sit on your lap or lie at your feet.  \n\nAlby walks with a slight limp on his front leg, but it doesn\u2019t seem to get in his way. \n\nHe enjoys long walks, but is not such a fan of the other dogs he meets on his walks! \n\nHe will growl and bark at most dogs and requires a tight hold on his leash in these moments. He gets a little overwhelmed when walking on busy streets.\n\nAlby likes things his way! When we got Alby, he would only eat cooked patties during meal times. We have since begun to mix his kibble with the cooked patties and he now enjoys both. We put his food on a plate because he doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy it when it\u2019s in a dog bowl. Like I said - diva! \n\nAlby also dislikes being manipulated in any way. If he does not want to do something, he may growl and flash his teeth. He has, however, never nipped either of us and has only done this when we tried to lift him up. He gives clear warnings when he is upset and immediately gives you cuddles right after. \n\nWe are not adopting Alby, only because we cannot sustain a lifestyle of being home all day and giving him all the attention he deserves in the future. \n\nHe deserves a quiet home with a family who will show him the same amount of love he has shown us! \n\nHis adopters will fall in love with him instantly, just as we have. \n\nWe love Alby a ton and hope he finds a forever home that is as special as he is. The fact that we teared up while writing this just says it all :) \n___________________________________\n\n____________________________________________\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current & previous setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n",

            "description": "I just rescued this sweetheart from the Shelter. New pictures & a more detailed Adoption Profile will be posted in the future as I get to know this dog. Please do not e-mail asking additional questions about this pet. I will update this dogs' Adoption Profile as I am able to assess this dog and know more about this dog if this pet is not adopted beforehand. \n\nMy Rescue does specialize in rescuing abused or neglected pets, so most have some fear issues. Especially of new people...\n \nI post updates on the pets in the comment section on each pets' post in our Facebook group. To see his/her progress, go to: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1405138936478168/\n\nAdoption includes:\n- Initial Vet check\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Up to date on Vaccinations \n- Microchip \n- Voucher for a future Free office visit to the Vet\n- 50% off any Optimum Wellness Plan\n- 30 days of free pet insurance (in case something comes up after adoption)\n- Collar \n- Harness *\n- Leash\n- Other surprise goodies from Safe Haven\n- Other coupons from Partners\n- Available Paperwork: Spay/Neuter records, Vaccination records, Vet records, Micro records, etc...\n- Continued Support: Safe Haven will be there for the lifetime of your new adopted pet. If you ever have questions or concerns, we will always be there to help. Our goal is for you & your pet to live happily ever after! \n\nPLEASE NOTE: All of the pets at Safe Haven receive basic training when they come to us. What each pet learns depends on how much time I have had to work with them, & if that pet has any additional issues that need to be focused on first.\n \n\nADOPTING A CAT OR DOG IS UP TO A 20 YEAR COMMITMENT! THEY ARE NOT OBJECTS THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF WHEN THEY BECOME INCONVENIENT. THEY ARE INNOCENT LIVING, BREATHING ANIMALS WITH FEELINGS THAT DEPEND ON YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF, LOVE, & PAY FOR EVERYTHING THIS PET NEEDS FOR UP TO 20 YEARS, THEN PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR AN APPLICATION.\n\n\n* Safe Haven STRONGLY believes that collars should only be used to hold their ID or as decoration. A dog can slip out of collar. Which becomes a problem if you are trying to restrain your dog, & it comes off. Also, attaching a leash to a collar puts pressure on the neck, which is one of the most delicate areas of the body, & could hurt them. For these reasons, Safe Haven includes a harness with every dog adoption to ensure the safety of the dog. A harness distributes the weight on the chest & shoulders. It also has a handle on the back that you can grab if need be, without hurting your pet (EX: Dog falls off your boat, just grab the handle & pull your pet back in with no harm done. With a collar, you would have to strangle your dog when pulling your dog in). Also, a dog cannot slip out of a harness if it is fitted correctly, so it is much easier to restrain them.\n\n\n*******\n \nFAQ: \nQ: Is this pet still available?\nA: The Adoption Profiles are taken down the same day the pet is adopted. So if you see this pet posted, this pet is still available. The only exception is our Facebook page where the profile stays up, and the pets are tagged as \"Adopted\". Updates are also posted in the comment section of each pets' individual post on our Facebook page for Safe Haven Animal Rescue of AZ at  https://www.facebook.com/groups/1405138936478168/  .Once on the Facebook page, you can type the pets name in the search box to easily pull up all the posts on that pet.\n\n \nQ: I don't see a phone #. Will someone please call me?\nA: Everything needed is online. I have found that online is the most efficient way to get all the work done. In the past, when I posted my #, my phone rang off the hook all day. So I spent the whole day on the phone, with not much work to show for it at the end of the day. Again, everything needed is online.\n \nQ: How do I adopt this pet?\nA: Your first step is to fill out an application. Please e-mail and ask for one at Safe_Haven_Animal_Rescue@live.com  \n \nQ: Where is this pet?  \nA:  This pet is being fostered in a private home.\n \nQ: I like what you are doing & would like to help. Would you be open to a partnership?\nA: Absolutely! I am open to anything that helps care for the animals &/or saves more lives! Please e-mail me at Safe_Haven_Animal_Rescue@live.com and give me details about what you have in mind.\n \nQ: How do I become a Sponsor?\nA: Thank you! Taking care of each pet gets expensive, and we are so grateful for any monthly donation towards the Vet care, food, treats, toys, ect...\n To become a Sponsor, please click on this link https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6DRAYJN5XEDZ2  You can pay with your PayPal account, or you can pay with a credit card.

He was originally adopted from the AWL in 2012, but found himself surrendered to the Trumbull County Dog Pound in October after his owner passed.  We believe Tonka has been an only pet throughout his life and has gotten used to being the center of attention.  He would do best in a home with older kids and no other pets.  Tonka enjoys baths and lounging around after a nice walk.  \n\nThis pet is current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, and will be microchipped at the time of adoption.\nVisit our website at: www.awlrescueme.com\nYou can also see all our pets at: www.petango.com\nCall the shelter at 330-539-5300 for additional information",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4526530.\n\nWednesday is a beautiful German Shepherd that is scared and confused and doesn't know why she is at the shelter. She is having difficulty with shelter life but the staff is working with her to socialize her and get her used to people. Right now, she doesn't want to walk on a leash but she does like to explore the play yard. She is still nervous around the kennel staff but they have seen her wag her tail a few times when she was in the yard. She won't take treats from their hand but she will eat them. She's just too nervous right now to get close to anyone.\n\nWednesday needs a rescue or adopter that understands she needs help with her social skills around people and that she's going to need a lot of time and patience when she gets to a new home. She can't go to a home with small children but she could go to a home with another calm, quiet dog. A dog introduction at the shelter is required. If you can give Wednesday the kind of home that she needs, please come and meet her today!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Millie is 4 years old at the time of intake in December 2020. Millie is good with people, cats and other dogs. She loves laying in bed and hanging with everyone in the home. This beautiful girl was raising her litter of puppies outside in the garbage and debris strewn yard of an abandoned house. There was no shelter from the elements and Millie was at the mercy of kind neighbors to provide her with food and water. That was no life for Millie or her pups, so as soon as we discovered Millie, we scooped Millie and her family up and brought them into rescue. All of her pups have found their forever home and it's Millie's turn now to be the center of attention! Millie loves to be petted, and she loves to be loved. If you can give Millie the happy life she deserves, please apply online to adopt Millie (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He is  !00% house and crate trained, neutered, HW negative, and up to date on all vaccines. \n\nForrest came from an outdoor animal hoarding situation where he spent his entire life on a chain, along with 30 other dogs. Although he has excellent house manners (he is as easy going and low maintenance as they come), he is very shy to new people and will require a family who understands he needs time and patience to come out of his shell. Forrest is much more comfortable with other dogs around, therefore a home with another dog for him to bond with is a requirement. We will unfortunately not be considering homes without other dogs at this time. \n\nForrest has great leash manners, loves to sun bathe, a peanut butter kong, and laying in his favorite bed. He has had limited exposure to children in his foster home.\n\nAnyone interested in Forrest should complete an application found on our website angelasark.org. Once Forrest is adopted, the posting will be removed.",

Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

As a puppy her fur was almost all black, now she's a lighter tan. \n\nShe\u2019s a big girl! We estimate she\u2019ll be 65lbs + when full grown. \n\nBella is looking for an active household with other playful dogs and kids over 10 only. She can be rather mouthy so she is looking for an experienced handler to guide her and train her to be a well-behaved dog. \nShe loves the water and loves being outside. \nShe gets along with all dogs and cats. She does like to play a lot! So she may be too much for older dogs. \n\nAll potential adopters are expected to complete an application and provide pictures of their yard, patio, and/or balcony making sure we can see the fence line and/or railing.  The application can be completed and submitted from our website - throwmeabonedogrescue.org - the link is found of the Adoption Process page.  Applications will be reviewed for approval before setting an appointment to come meet and possibly adopt the dog of interest.  In addition, those who live in a rental property are expected to provide proof that they are allowed to have a dog where they live.\n\nEach of our rescued dogs has been de-wormed if necessary, de-flea'd (with topical treatment if old enough, and by medicated bath if too young), spayed/neutered, microchipped, is up to date on shots, and has been fully examined by a veterinarian.  In addition, each adopted dog comes with a starter baggie of the food it has been eating, a few treats for training purposes, a rawhide chew, a lead and collar, and a folder containing pertinent records.",

In addition she had pain from lack of dental care, and received a full dental, a few extractions, and now will have no pain in her mouth. Thank you to our awesome Medical Team!\nGinger is a beautiful 12 year old Siberian Husky and she is hoping to get out of the shelter and into a forever home that is just right for her. Ginger loves to be outside, she is healthy and happy, and has the more relaxed, independent personality. Ginger is your typical good natured Siberian with a mind of her own and a love for life. Ginger had been on a sled dog team in her younger years and loves to get up and go, but can not keep the pace like she use to. Ginger is use to being top dog on the team and will to best in a home with a male dog and with no small critters to chase. Ginger is now looking to settle down, with walks now and again to keep the blood flowing. But she really just needs a soft place to land and be a retired pampered pooch! Ginger is a real sweetheart looking for that special someone to share her heart with!\n*If you are interested in adopting Ginger please call the shelter (509 662-9577) to set an appointment to meet her.",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet Phaedre:: 135 pounds, 4 years old, Spayed Female Great Dane. \n\nAvailable for Adoption!\n\nThis stunning girl was surrendered to us by her family after she accidently knocked over their toddler, who she loved dearly. Her family originally purchased her as a puppy for $3,000 from a pet store with intentions of breeding her. It appears that she has had at least one litter, and she was a bit overweight when she came to us, but she is slimming down and getting into shape quickly in her foster home with a good diet and plenty of play time. Phaedre is a wonderfully happy girl and she adjusted quickly to her foster home without skipping a beat. She adores every person she meets, loves children, gets along great with other dogs and doesn't bother her foster's cat (any cats in the home should be use to living with dogs). Phaedra is still very young at heart and has a lot of life and love to give! She is the sweetest, most affectionate girl you'll meet!\n\nWe will be looking for a home for Phaedre who has Great Dane and/or Giant Breed dogs (i.e. breeds over 100 pounds at a healthy weight). Children in the home should be 8+.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee.\n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nOur adoption area, unless otherwise specified in their bio, is within a two hour radius of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue for adult dogs, and within a one hour radius for puppies. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet. A volunteer will contact you if you are selected for a meet with adoptable pet. Final approval is always made in person.\n\nPeppermint Pig Animal Rescue is a no-kill rescue. Please consider sponsoring a pet or donating to our cause. Click the DONATE tab on our website to learn more about how you can help. THANK YOU !\n\nFor questions or inquiries on our adoptable pets, please feel free to contact our volunteer rescue team directly by submitting a Contact Form from our website, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/contact-us/",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4504156.\n\nShayna has now been at the shelter for over 60 days and she is ready to go home! Many of the volunteers that have taken her out for walks say she is such a great dog. She walks nice and easy on a leash and still has a spring in her step for being 8 years old. She is affectionate and loves to be petted. She also knows \"sit\" for treats and will take them gently. It's a mystery why this pretty girl hasn't been adopted yet.\n\nWhen Shayna sees another dog on the walking trail, she is curious and watches the dog but then continues on her walk. But when she sees another dog in a kennel barking at her, she runs up and barks at them too. If a dog is quiet in their kennel, she leaves them alone. So Shayna can be picky about her friends and needs a dog introduction if you already have a dog at home.\n\nShayna would make a great addition to a family with older children (12+). If you think Shayna could do well in your home, please come and meet her today! She'd love to go home.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "New Beginnings Shepherd Rescue is a volunteer based rescue, we work very hard to help as many adoptable GSDs as possible. Most of our dogs come from high kill shelters across the country, so sadly we do not have any background information on them.....but we work very hard to get to know each and every dog brought into our program in need of a new beginning in their lives. We do not take animals with aggression problems (some may not like other dogs, cats, or may require older kids as opposed to younger children, but we will let you know everything that we know) most of these beautiful dogs have been faithful and loving family pets for their entire lives, yet still have lost their homes and families through no fault of their own. If you are interested in opening your heart and home to one of these amazing dogs please fill out our adoption application at https://www.newbeginningsrescue.com/adoption-application and we will get back in touch after we get it processed. If you don't hear from us in 3 days, please send us a gentle reminder and one of us will get right on it.\n\nPlease indicate the dog you are interested in meeting, where it says preference on the application! You may also email julie@newbeginningsrescue.com , we are always happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\nIf you give them your heart, they will give you theirs.",

Please contact Marissa at m_l_figueroa@yahoo.com to find out more about Niko and to meet him. DO NOT APPLY TO BFPA and also note that Niko is currently being fostered. in Greenville NC.\n\nNiko is a super friendly, @two year old, red nose pit bull. He is currently 60 pounds but could be anywhere from 60-85 pounds. He gets along with other dogs but has not had any interaction with cats yet. He has been around children 10 years old and up and did good minus the fact that he likes to give hugs. We are working on that and he is doing better. He was around a week-old baby and when he heard the cry, he kept trying to see her but because he likes to give hugs, I have not yet let him in touching distance.\n\nNiko is totally housebroken. During the day I usually take him outside every couple hours to play around and potty. He really wants to play but even more than that he just wants love and attention. He will lounge around all day if you want but shouldn't because he is a baby and needs play time. A fenced yard is necessary in his forever home so he can get his energy out in the yard. Niko could be an only dog or join a family with furry siblings that he would love to play with in the yard.\n\nNiko is crate trained! He knows when I say\" kennel up\" to go in, he usually understands when I open the crate. When he is in the crate, if I'm still in the room, he is quiet, but if I am leaving him alone, he will cry for a little and try to break out. At night, most times he sleeps in his crate, but he loves to snuggle so occasionally he sleeps in the bed. We are working on leash walking and he still pulls some but is doing good.\n\nNiko's favorite thing to do is run in the hallways of my apartment. He loves to run around and body wrestle. He is shy with toys, but we are working on that, he likes balls he can kick around. Niko is the sweetest baby I've met. He deserves a loving home, he has so many strong points : People friendly, dog friendly, ferret friendly, potty trained, crate trained, gives lots of kisses and cuddles. The absolute most perfect family pet.\n\nDISCLAIMER: We hope you'll consider adopting NIKO. He is a courtesy listed dog. This means that he is not a part of or associated with Best Friend Pet Adoption (BFPA). The bio information listed for him was provided by his owner and not generated or verified by BFPA. Adoption arrangements will be a private arrangement between you and the owner. As with any dog adoption, BFPA encourages potential adopters to gain as much information as possible before adopting. This includes temperament testing and verification of vet records to ensure the dog is in good health, UTD on vaccinations and has been sterilized.

Rambo is believed to be a Great Dane/Hound Mix and is six years old. He is good with other dogs, good with children, loves car rides and is just generally an easy going guy. He truly believes he is a lap dog and won't hesitate to try and show you that size doesn't matter when you can cuddle like he does.\n\nRambo has already met with our vet and other than a hot spot on his foot he is working on getting cleared up (we're helping), he is ready to start making friends!! Contact us online or at 904-392-3416 if you want to meet up!!",

He is a huge lover who pushes his head into your hand for pets and gives the full-on lean when you sit down beside him. Max does great in the car and is good on the leash - though, in true husky fashion, he does sometimes have a mind of his own about which way to go. We are still getting to know Max but so far think he would be fine with another dog. We are looking for an active and husky experienced home with no small kids and tall solid fencing.\nDOGS:\n\nThe first step of our adoption process for dogs is to fill out our \"\" interested party application\"\" form online at this link \n\nhttps://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=ac0662&method=online_form_html&formid=12\n\n\nCATS:\n\nFor more information on our cats please send an email to cats@vipp.org\n\nPlease note we are an all-volunteer organization and it may take us several days to respond.",

            "description": "Meet Presley! Presley is around 1 year old and 60lbs. This hound dog is ALL shook up waiting to meet his future family! Presley has proved to be a lover, not the hunter. Unfortunately for him, that was his only crime, but enough for his owners to send him to doggie jail. You see, gun shots scared poor Presley, and therefore he was deemed not worthy of his home. This hunk a hunk burnin' love would prefer cuddles and walks, rather than loud bangs and searching for dead things. This \"teddy bear\" just wants love and a family of his own! No cats allowed is this guys castle!\n\nUpdate 1/25/21 - Presley unfortunately tested positive for heartworm disease. He got this by being bitten by an infected mosquito. He is not contagious to other dogs (but all dogs should be on heartworm prevention monthly, year-round to prevent infection/reinfection). Underdog has started Presley on treatment for heartworm, and with proper after-care, he will fully recover. His adopter will simply need to bring Presley to scheduled treatment appointments and keep him CALM (with strict crate rest or supervised relaxation) post treatment injections (for 3 months). We provide adopters with instructions and will cover needed medication. We are seeking applicants who live in the greater Madison area, since crucial treatment and care (multiple visits over 2 months) are completed at our vet clinic, located in Madison. Dogs who are treated for heartworm have a positive likelihood of recovery when post-treatment instructions and rest are followed.\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

He greets with full body wiggles and an epic \"lean\"!\n\nWe call Buddy \"serious puppy\" because of just how mature he acts with his young age. He doesn't let any of the dogs push him over and will always stand his ground when greeting a pushy dog. Buddy loves going for long walks and playing with toys in the yard. He'll often zip around throwing toys up in the air.. one after the other! \n\nBuddy would do best in a home without young children. He could go to a home with doggie companion that suits his more laidback play style.\n\n***While we are very grateful for PetFinder, we have been having chronic problems receiving inquires. Please contact us directly if you are interested in adopting by emailing us at lovedogs.bedfordny@gmail.com and visit fortheloveofdogsrescue.org***",

Annika and Adler have been doing great with learning manners and basic commands in their foster homes.

Annika and Adler have been living in separate foster homes and are doing great, they do not need to be adopted together. \n\n$195 Adoption Fee.\n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nAdoption area for Annika and Adler is within 2 hours of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.

            "description": "Meet Pavel! He is a small guy weighing in at a mere 20lbs. He\u2019s around 3-5 years old-  he came from a hoarding situation in AL and is now safe in foster care. \n He\u2019s looking for a home willing to invest 1x love, knowing they\u2019ll get 10x love in return.\n Pavel is a master of the side-eye and slow to trust. When he sees your demonstrated patience, calm, and love, he comes out of his shell and wants to cuddle. A lot!\n He has been showing more of his spunky personality day by day. He began as quiet and timid, spending time in his crate with the door open however he has become more adventurous. He loves dog puzzles and other canine enrichment activities. He has spurts of energy and then will cuddle by your side. He loves to be on your lap or giving hugs when you\u2019ll let him. At night, he sleeps well in his crate. \n Pavel never had a chance to be potty trained, and is working on it. He\u2019s not keen on leashes yet, and should be considered a flight risk. He can jump a low fence. There\u2019s a lot of spring in those surprisingly long legs!\n Pavel has interacted positively with our resident dogs. He is a smart and gentle boy who looks forward to being your very best bud and will happily learn tricks for Wisconsin cheese curds.\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

She can get carried away sometimes with the playing and is having to be taught to not be so overbearing sometimes, but she just likes to play hard and is a young girl who was never taught any better.  She has a great temperament, friendly disposition, is terrifically affectionate, and really wants to belong to someone.  She is very good-natured and enjoys playing with other dogs, she used to romp and play with a baby goat before she came to us.  Cam is dear, darling, and absolutely gorgeous, and needs a home that will give her some TLC and bring her some peace and security so she will feel loved and confident.  She has her whole life ahead of her and does not need to spend it in a kennel.  We are looking for loving, understanding, responsible homes who have good sense and experience as to how to direct and develop Cam's behavior into the diamond she really is.",

This can be very dangerous. He is looking for a family that likes to take leash walks or has a taller fence to keep him safe. Cruz can be a little shy, but quickly warms up. Just look at that smile! Cruz is 1 year old, appears to be housebroken and friendly with other pets. He is approximately 50 pounds and wants to start his new life ASAP.\n\nAdoption fee: $160 includes his neuter, initial vaccines and deworming, and testing for heartworm. \n\nIf interested, please submit an adoption application online via our website, www.petswithoutparents.net. We are happy to help you meet \"the one\" all 7 days of the week!\n\nVisit www.petswithoutparents.net for more information about the rescue helping this little one!",

He weighs 7 lbs.\nKit Kat is fun, playful, talkative and loves other dogs of all sizes. He has also lived happily with cats. \nHe was taught  many tricks and has a personality that demands love and fun. \nHe has tons and tons of confidence with people and dogs and is very outgoing!\nKit Kat is talkative so a house with a fenced yard is best for him. He likes to have a say in everything and talk to his foster mom. Therefore no apartments / condos / townhomes please. \nHe has been fully vaccinated / blood work done and just had his dental. \n\nIf you would like to adopt Kit Kat, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only. IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH YOU WILL BE CONTACTED typically within 72 hours. YOU WILL HEAR FROM US ONLY IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH FOR ONE OF OUR RESCUE ANIMALS AND OUR ADOPTION GUIDELINES/PROGRAM. WE MUST REVIEW A COMPLETED APPLICATION BEFORE A POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT IS ARRANGED. NO EXCEPTIONS. All visits with the puppies/dogs are by approved applications and appointments only.\n\n* We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification and not all applications or inquiries may receive a response. *\n\nThank you for your interest in our rescue dogs.\n",

I\u2019ve also got little white socks on all my feet, as well as a snow-capped tail. I look fabulous and I know it!\n\nI\u2019m looking for a lifetime companion who can dedicate lots of love and attention to me. In return, I\u2019ll provide your life with plenty of cuddles and many laughs, given my silly disposition. Around the house, I will follow you around, curious about what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019d probably be happy to help too, if you just teach me how. I'm still learning house manners so you'll have to teach me & keep an eye on me until I learn. I\u2019m quick to learn what I\u2019m permitted, especially if there\u2019s food involved. Speaking of food, I\u2019m not very picky about my food or water, which means sometimes I\u2019ll lick your floor/oven and drink toilet water if given the chance. Cheerios have been a great training treat for me. I\u2019m also still learning to not mouth on humans. \n If you\u2019re busy, I\u2019ll generally spend my time sleeping on the couch or crate, and watching out the window. \nI\u2019m still working on housetraining. I know to potty outside, but I need routine & schedule because I'm still learning. \n\nI did spend some time with other dogs in my previous home, and I seemed to get along with them alright. \n\nOutside, I\u2019m pretty good on leash, though if there is something interesting I\u2019ll go after it without thinking. I haven\u2019t had any problems with passing-by strangers petting me. \n I like playing outside regardless of snow on the ground. \n As of now, I loathe being restrained inside of a car. I\u2019ll cry and bark to let you know, so I\u2019d appreciate you taking the time to teach me that everything is going to be okay when I\u2019m in a car.\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

            "description": "Magnus is a handsome male with piercing amber-colored eyes who just came into our rescue. He weighs 67 lbs and is 3 years old we were told. \nHe was surrendered to us after his owners could no longer take care of him. He's very food motivated, so with a bit of good food and exercise he'll get to where his weight needs to be!\n\nHe enjoys the company of his foster dog siblings, but is fairly shy and submissive to them. He absolutely loves his chew toys, especially the heavy duty ones! When he's taking a break from the activities, he enjoys going back into his crate or hanging out with his foster parents on the couch. \n\nHe loves to interact with people and will practically fall over with all of the tail wags that he uses to greet you with! He doesn't know how to give doggie kisses and instead just gently bumps his wet nose on faces.\n\nMagnus has fairly good leash manners but will still need to go into an obedience and training program to ensure that he excels and that he and his forever home thrive together.  He is very active and is constantly using his nose to sniff around. He'll do really well in a home that loves to go on plenty of walks and hikes!\n\nIf you are interested in adding Magnus to your family, please fill out an application form!\n\n\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only. IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH YOU WILL BE CONTACTED typically within 72 hours. YOU WILL HEAR FROM US ONLY IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH FOR ONE OF OUR RESCUE ANIMALS AND OUR ADOPTION GUIDELINES/PROGRAM. WE MUST REVIEW A COMPLETED APPLICATION BEFORE A POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT IS ARRANGED. NO EXCEPTIONS. All visits with the puppies/dogs are by approved applications and appointments only.\n\n* We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification and not all applications or inquiries may receive a response. *\n\nThank you for your interest in our rescue dogs.",

            "description": "Talk about a superwoman! Koa is a 3 year old spayed female boxer/pit bull mix who weighs about 40 lbs. Koa's story started when she was spotted on the streets as a stray. She had obviously given birth recently and was scavenging for food so she could properly feed her babies who were snuggled safely in a den she dug for them. Koa was a wonderful mama and kept her puppies safe, fat, and happy until they all were captured and brought to safety. Now that her puppies are weaned and ready for their own families, Koa deserves a family of her very own. This girl is as sweet as pie. She is weary of new people at first, especially men, but warms up quickly. She just needs a little time. No time was wasted getting comfortable in her foster home. She was happy to walk around and check things out with a toy in her mouth. Koa has been good with other dogs, seems fine with cats, and even did well with the respectful kiddos she met! She'll need some patience as she learns about the finer things in life, but we don't think it will take her very long. Koa seems to be housebroken and has alerted her foster family when she has to go outside.

This just means you'll be the apple of my eye and my source of safety and security. I'm looking for a person that will understand me and help me gain confidence at my own pace. I would appreciate a quiet, low-traffic home without children, as a busy household may be overwhelming for me. Because I get a tad nervous with noises and meeting new people, I'm probably not cut out for apartment-living. I need to meet all family members and dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Rocko will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Rocko 1369809 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the A pups: Annika and Adler, 6 months old, Shepherd/Bully type mixes.\n\nAvailable for Adoption!\n\nThese two adorable siblings are playful and so sweet and ready to find their forever homes! Annika and Adler have been doing great with learning manners and basic commands in their foster homes. They are housebroken, but still puppies, so they may still have an accident here and there if they don't get out side in time. They both love to play with other dogs and they are good with kids (5+). Annika and Adler have been living in separate foster homes and are doing great, they do not need to be adopted together. \n\n$195 Adoption Fee.\n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nAdoption area for Annika and Adler is within 2 hours of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

This precious Pup holds a sad story behind his beautiful brown eyes...but regardless of his rough start to life, King has not let that break his sweet spirit. A remarkable dog, King has turned starvation and struggle into strength; his story is just beginning and our wish for him is the happily ever after he will find in a Forever Friend or Family!\n\nKing is still young...but wise beyond his years. He is hungry for attention and direction...a very intelligent learner, King already responds to instructions like sit, down, uh-uh/no, out of the kitchen and is quick to change his behavior with gentle correction. His desire to please his humans makes him a student with fast results - pets and love are all the positive reinforcement King needs to keep his training on track.\n\nKing loves people - he is also great with kids and other dogs too! He is excited to welcome his Humans home and has not shown any concerns with separation anxiety. He is completely house-broken and will ask to go out if he needs or wants some backyard/play time. King is also crate-trained, he likes to keep an eye on his People and prefers to sleep (in or outside his kennel) and stay close to them as much as possible. He is a constant companion of the best sort - always there for a snuggle or smile, he will make the perfect pup for anyone looking to add joy and fun to their home!\n\nHe loves baths, walks and naps. He walks well on a leash and with more instruction/training would be an amazing fitness partner. King though, is also always open to some snooze time too. He is an active and relaxed dog at the same time - best of all worlds, King wants love more than anything and will accommodate any of his Humans needs or daily activities.\n\nThis amazing pup deserves the royal treatment and we hope he finds that in you! Come apply for a meet-and-greet and I guarantee you will fall in love fast! I know we did - King will rule your heart and home with lot of Happy and Fun and be your loyal Friend for life.\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

I am a German Shepard mix, petite in size. My foster mom thinks I am the best and she should know as I am her 43rd foster dog! I am a sweet dog that loves calm and loving attention. Just a whisper of my name and my tail wags uncontrollably! My foster mom thinks I am an old soul who is taking time to learn all that my new life has to offer. I dont have much experience with getting in and out of cars, stairs or sliding doorsbut I am courageously learning each and every day. Today was the first I took toys out of the toy box, how fun dog toys are! I love my foster dog sister even though her puppy energy can be a bit much for me. A home with an older or calmer dog probably would be my preference; or even if I were to be the only dog in a family would be fantastic. I have done really well with older kids (9+ years old) that know I am a calm and easygoing dog wanting more pets and loves rather than to play energetically. It is funny how the kids giggle when I gently place my paw on their arms reminding them that I could use a loving pet. \n\nI am so looking forward to meeting my new loving family that will patiently introduce me to all the wonder a Colorado dog life has to offersnow, hikes, mountains and most importantly love. \n\n*Homeownership Required!

Ballad might be considered a wallflower at first, but once she knows you're safe and comes to consider you a friend, she'll be asking for regular cuddle sessions, and won't want to leave your side! Ballad and Ode are looking for a home that will welcome them both as they are a bonded pair. Ballad was heartworm positive when she arrived at ARF. Heartworm is a parasite that is spread by mosquito bites and infects the bloodstream, heart, and lungs. She must be on strict rest until 3/5/21. Ballad has a positive history with other dogs. She currently weighs 61 pounds. Ballad is being cared for in a foster home, so is available by appointment only. Please submit an application if you are interested in adopting this animal. Ballad's adopter must be at least 18 years old with valid state-issued identification. ARF encourages family members to participate in the adoption process, especially children and family dogs.

Come see us! **\n\nYear of birth:  2016\n\nIf the best part of your day is getting home to a dog ready to give you love than Kobe is the dog for you. You will fall in love with his bright blue eyes and loving personality. He gets hyper when he goes outside, however, he mellows out after a few zoomies around the yard. He\u2019s a chunk that is not shy about his love for treats. Kobe is a lover who is eager to please, making him a great fit for an affectionate home with other large breed dogs.\n\n He thrives off of the closeness of his humans, which will make it easy to get on a potty schedule. Though he pulls when on the leash we have been working with him and he has been responding positively to training. Kobe would not do well in a house with cats as he has shown aggression.\n\nSadly, Kobe tested positive for heartworms.  We need to get him into a home during his treatment. The cost for the heartworm treatment is covered.  We can provide you with more info about his heartworm treatment if you are interested in adopting or fostering him. \n\nAdoption hours at our shelter: Monday - Friday 9am-4pm, BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and some weekend hours.  To make an appointment or for more information, please call us at 913-321-1445.  If you have a dog, you can also arrange to bring your dog with you to meet our dogs to see if it's a good match.\n\nOur dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older).\n\nVisit our Petfinder home page at http://kckac.petfinder.com for more info about adopting our pets.",

If you are interested in knowing more about Kailee after reading her biography, please complete an adoption application on the SLR web site and enter Kailee as the sweet, loving lady you would like to provide a forever home to. If you have already had your interview, the foster mom will contact you to answer any additional questions you may have.\n Kailee is a \u2018Parti\u2019 color (black/white/silver) She weighs 15 lbs., is approximately 10 years old, and has natural ears and a natural tail. This little lady is house trained. No crating for her! She is working on her leash training. Of course she is spayed and up-to-date on all of her shots. She lost several teeth during her dental and now the remaining teeth are pearly white. She is a mix but she does not shed. She is not an \u2018Alpha\u2019 dog and is even friendly to cats. Kailee will be best in an adult home only. She would be fine as an only dog but also enjoys the companionship of other dogs.\nKailee is blind and deaf. She needs a stable environment where the furniture stays in place once she is part of the family. Kailee learns her environment very quickly as she is very confident and smart and has learned to overcome her vision and hearing issues \u2013 one might say her IQ is in the gifted range! She loves to cuddle with her foster and stays close to \u2018her person\u2019 throughout the day.\nKailee is treat motivated and has learned the command to \u2018sit.\u2019 She also knows when it is time to have her leash put on and go for a walk. Kailee has learned various \u2018touches\u2019 and what they mean. She is now working on a new touch for \u2018down.\u2019 Kailee would like a forever home that would enjoy continuing with teaching her various commands. If you feel you are the Forever Home that Kailee is looking for, please complete an adoption application and enter \u2018Kailee\u2019 as the sweet lady you are interested in.

Great! We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process.

All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

If you are interested in Bandit, fill out an adoption application online and list him as the particular dog you are applying for. Already submitted an application and had your interview, then contact your state interviewer to request more information.\nBandit is a 10 month old male Mini Schnauzer. He weighs 14 lbs, has natural ears, a docked tail, and is gray in color. Bandit is up-to-date with his shots, on Heartworm Preventatives and is neutered. He was owner surrendered due to his lack of vision.\nBandit has retinal dysplasia in both eyes which has caused him to be have limited vision. He has been to an eye specialist. The specialist explained that retinal dysplasia is an inherited degenerative disease of the retina. It is passed from the parents to their offspring. There is no cure or treatment for retinal dysplasia. Fortunately, this is not a painful condition. Bandit still has some vision, and it is recommended that he be on a prescription oral retinal supplement to help slow further deterioration of the back of the eyes.\n\n\nMake no mistake, this does not slow this energizer bunny down. He is all puppy. And, as a puppy, he will get into things he shouldn\u2019t. So firm boundaries are a must. Bandit should be with adults only or a home with older children who will respect his disability. With his limited sight, Bandit startles easily. He will bark at the slightest noise until he is moved away or distracted. Bandit needs continuity (the same schedule daily). He needs an adopter who works from home or is retired.\n\nBandit will do best with another dog in the home, a guide dog per se. A fenced yard is a must. The eye specialist claims this will give him security and some independence.\n\nLet\u2019s recap Bandit\u2019s requirements for adoption:\n\u2022 Accept a special needs rescue/Oral supplement prescription runs $75 to $90 every three months\n\u2022 Home with adults or adults with older children\n\u2022 Another dog in the home\n\u2022 Fenced yard\n\u2022 Willing to work and train with Bandit/Strong pack leader\n\u2022 Patience and more patience\n\nIf you can provide for Bandit and give him the human love and kindness he deserves,\nthen apply today.\nLet this Bandit steal your heart!\n\n",

I will snuggle with you on the couch and hang with you all day indoors. My fosters have worked with me on crate training, no leash pulling, and being around other dogs. Within one week of training, there is so much improvement! I can be anxious and need to be with someone who will be patient with me and love me no matter what.

            "description": "Year of birth: 2014\n\nGeorge deserves a life full of love and happiness and is great with other dogs. George, a lab mix, was confiscated with his brother Ringo from a cruelty and neglect situation. (Ringo will be up for adoption soon). George thoroughly enjoys attention and thrives with close human contact. He loves to play outside but for the most part remains docile during the day. Due to his previous owners neglect George now suffers from chronic dry eye that will require daily wiping of his eyes. However, this chronic condition has not impaired his vision or willingness to be loved by a suitable owner.\n\n As he previously lived with Ringo he is extremely dog friendly and has been in numerous play groups throughout his months at the shelter. George\u2019s loving personality makes him eager to please, which is why with the proper schedule he can be fully potty trained very quickly. The neglect he suffered left him with little to no leash training but we have been working with him to improve. George is very curious about cats but shows no aggression. \n\n\u2022\u2022 Our shelter will be open this Sunday, January 31 from Noon to 2pm. Come see us! **\n\nAdoption hours at our shelter: Monday - Friday 9am-4pm, BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and some weekend hours.  To make an appointment or for more information, please call us at 913-321-1445.  If you have a dog, you can also arrange to bring your dog with you to meet our dogs to see if it's a good match.\n\nOur dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older).\n\nVisit our Petfinder home page at http://kckac.petfinder.com for more info about adopting our pets.",

            "description": "In early November we took in a dog who was severely shut down, unable to be removed from her kennel at the NYC city shelter, or even be collared and leashed. She was scheduled to be euthanized but we knew we just needed to get her out of the shelter. SWEET TART, renamed SWEET TEA, was petrified of being outside and showed signs of living with a dominant person who was likely a recluse or a shut in.\n\nToday, two months later, we are thrilled to share that we are officially looking for a for SWEET TEA! She has been rehabilitated enough that she can be placed with an adopter willing to help her grow to her full potential! \n\nSWEET TEA has recovered beautifully from surgery to remove 21 rotted teeth, most with exposed nerve. Living a pain free life has helped her open up and take in more of the world. Thanks to her incredible foster mom, Opal, SWEET TEA, started venturing outside into her backyard at the end of December. We suspect SWEET TEA had not been outside in years. She was only using indoor weewee pads to relieve herself, which she\u2019d been trained to do. These days she heads outside for about 90% of her potty breaks and lingers to explore a bit! The video  may not seem like much but when you consider her story, it\u2019s a major mountain for her!\n\nWHAT DOES SWEET TEA, 50 lbs., 9-10 yrs, NEED? \n* Quiet neighborhood or rural community with a fenced in yard. She is not yet able to tolerate a leash so the yard is important as her new owner will need to be patient and understand she may take a long time to get used to a leash, if ever. SWEET TEA will need, and only wants, a small, quiet world.\n* Low key, calm home. SWEET TEA is a senior with overall low energy. A calm, quiet home (no kids) with a person or people who like to hang out at home and who are low key is ideal. \n* Pets? SWEET TEA does not appear interested in other dogs. While she could prefer to not interact with other dogs (she was uninterested in our helper dog, Joey, when she met him) this could change as she settles into her new life.\n\nFor more in her story visit #AdoptSweatTeaMBC \nEmail elli@mrbonesandco.org with questions.\nTo apply to adopt within driving distance of NY state, head www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt\n\n#AdoptSweatTeaMBC #OneLuckyPup #RescueistheNewBlack",

I think, she might have some frenchie in her. She's very vocal and has that unique French Bulldog sound. Her paperwork says basset mix. She's 4 years old and 35lbs. Total diva.\nShe's active and curious.\nSophie gets in the car and up stairs well.\nShe will need a firm owner as she thinks she's the boss. Once she knows she's not in charge, she's more relaxed.\nSophie might not do well with kids under the age of 12 as she is snippy while she is decompressing.\nShe also might prefer to be an only dog.",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet Kobe:: 2 years old, 60 pounds, Neutered Male Bully/Staffy mix.\n\nAvailable for Adoption!\n\nKobe is literally the best boy you will ever meet! He is a GORGEOUS light Brindle color and he is a total baby, he absolutely adores all the people he meets and he loves to give you all of his affection and snuggles. Kobe is housebroken and does well if left out of the crate when his people are gone. He doesn't chew anything and just waits patiently for you to return. He has amazing in-home manners and would never beg for table food :) Kobe loves to go on walks and he is doing great with ignoring the other songs who pass. Kobe is very selective of his dog friends and would do best as the only dog in the home so he can be sure to have all of your love and attention to himself! Kobe is the biggest lover of people, but is just not a big fan of having other fur friends. Due to his intense snuggling abilities, any children in the home should be 10+ :) \n\n$145 Adoption Fee.\n\nWe'll be looking for large dog experience for Kobe, no otherdogs in the home.\n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nOur adoption area, unless otherwise specified in their bio, is within a two hour radius of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue for adult dogs, and within a one hour radius for puppies. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet. A volunteer will contact you if you are selected for a meet with adoptable pet. Final approval is always made in person.\n\nPeppermint Pig Animal Rescue is a no-kill rescue. Please consider sponsoring a pet or donating to our cause. Click the DONATE tab on our website to learn more about how you can help. THANK YOU !\n\nFor questions or inquiries on our adoptable pets, please feel free to contact our volunteer rescue team directly by submitting a Contact Form from our website, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/contact-us/",

Cute and sweet as they come. She is 10 years young and approximately 22 pounds, but could stand to lose a little. It's that time of year lol. Precious enjoys going on walks and is great on a leash. She loves attention and will surprise you with her peppy, fun enthusiasm! She definitely can be spunky and it just adds to her charm. Precious would love to meet you! \n\nADOPTION FEE: $350.00 The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations including rabies, HW test if age appropriate, de-worming, microchip, fecal, spay or neuter, Heartworm and flea and tick preventative.  ADOPTION PROCESS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY The first step in the adoption process is to fill out an application online at www.placingpawsrescue.org. Once we review the applications, those applicants that are thought to be a good match will be contacted as quickly as possible. We ask that you please be patient with us as we are all volunteers. Then a telephone interview will take place, references checked and a home visit will be conducted. We will then arrange for you to meet the dog. We require that all family members, including current dogs meet the dog prior to adoption.  We put all of the known information in the animals description. If the animal is listed on the website, we are still accepting applications for that animal. We only remove the animal when the final adoption paperwork is signed. The best way to contact us is by email at placingpaws@yahoo.com. It is very difficult for the limited numbers of volunteers to return all calls. Thank you.",

She is shy at first, but once she got out of her kennel, she warmed up and started trusting and even wagging her tail as she excitedly explored her surroundings. She is treat motivated so should be trainable, did her bathroom business outside so probably house trained. The longer we interacted with her, the more attentive she became and her tail even wagged. She just needs some time to get to know you and become your best friend. It is reported that she is not too keen on men, but when I was walking her, we approached Anthony, one of the shelter's dog trainers, and she showed no aggression, no growl or even fear as she let him give her a treat and pet her. She also got good grades on her behavioral assessment. Come give this sweet girl a chance so she can find all the love and security she deserves. \n\nObservations by volunteer S. Shaffer 2/1/21",

            "description": "If a bulldozer and chocolate muffin had a baby, Casanova would be his name! Casanova is a lively boy with an obsession for tennis balls. He is a a year old young buck which means he will need someone dedicated to helping him learn manners. He is learning to play with dogs and will be best with a confident dog buddy that can show him the ropes and tolerate his energy level or as an only child. Casanova would like to find an active family with adults or older (teenagers and up) children that can handle a spunky boy. Casanova knows a family is out there that will appreciate a boy that plays hard during the day and snuggles just as hard at night. If you have a special home for this boy, call 803-628-3190 to schedule an appointment today! All Adoptions require a Pre-Adoption Interview with a YCAS Adoption Counselor, a meet and greet, and adoption approval. Every adoptable dog is Heartworm Negative, Spayed or Neutered, implanted with a microchip, current on age appropriate vaccinations including a current 1 year Rabies Vaccination, and current on monthly Flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention. All pets are behaviorally and medically evaluated prior to being placed up for adoption. The adoption fee is $77.",

In other words, Im just right! I get along with other dogs, and I prefer a more calm style of play. No rough-housing here! I also really love people. If I have a canine sibling, thats great, but Id also be happy to be your only dog. (I really just want a family.) If youre looking to add some zest to your life, I dont want to brag, but I am very sweet and fun. You should definitely adopt me.",

He is house broken, allows touch all over, and is fine around the resident GSD. He is still very much a puppy-sometimes mouthy and not leash trained yet, but he's easily correctable. Lawrence is a little timid outside when he sees other dogs/cars, and he hasn't learned to climb hardwood stairs yet but we're working on it. He's a gorgeous pup and will make a great pet for someone who is committed to his training and exercise.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

Pamela came into Cafa from Forrest Hill Heartworm negative and with 3 adorable puppies.  She is an amazing girl.  Very sweet and smart.  Loves making new friends. Due to her breed we are not able to consider rentals.\n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention. A health certificate is issued by a licensed Louisiana veterinarian.\n\nAdoption details:  \nIn some instances, a meet and greet is not possible before adoption unless we have a foster home in New England available. Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors.

            "description": "Due to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

Unfortunately this handsome guy was given up when his original family couldn\u2019t support his needs. He needed training as all puppies do \u2013 and has since blossomed into a special dog. He needs a family who is committed to his ongoing training and ready to help expose is true potential!\n\nDuke doesn\u2019t know his own size and considers himself a lap dog! His fosters describe him as goofy, active, submissive, affectionate, cuddly and playful. Duke is looking for an active family with lots of time to take him on outdoor adventures. He would be a great second dog to an equally playful canine pal. Duke is the definition of a gentle giant and will make a special addition to one lucky family.\n\nDuke is all over the people he trusts \u2013 but it takes time to earn that with him. With his foster parents he is constantly asking for cuddles and pets. He adores the companionship of his trusted humans. When new people enter the home he will bark or growl to protect his space. He is still learning that humans mean no harm and his socialization will be an ongoing effort. It took him approximately one week to warm up to his foster mom so potential adopters should have realistic expectations. He is particularly protective in the home and prefers to meet new people outside. When he is ignored and able to ensure there is no threat, he warms up very quickly.\n\nDuke is a HIGH energy boy and has an extensive exercise routine to keep him balanced! He gets up for the first time at 7am, and goes out for his first potty break. After breakfast he goes for his first walk of the day that typically lasts one hour. Around lunch time he will get his second walk, and third walk is after dinner. His final walk of the day is usually around 9pm and is around 30 minutes in duration. Throughout the day his foster family also provides him with various forms of mental stimulation to keep his brain busy and focused. Potential adopters would do best to stick to a similar routine to ensure his success. It needs to be understood that he will need a minimum of 3-4 hours of exercise per day, not counting additional mental stimulation. He is not left alone much during the day but sometimes takes a few minutes to settle in his crate. With his current schedule, he is fully potty trained.\n\nDuke is smart and would benefit from a family committed to daily training. He thrives with structure and a predictable schedule. He needs support with leash training and basic obedience commands. Although he has picked up sit, paw and recall quickly, he has the potential to learn so much more. Duke has done well with leash training but needs a strong handler as he pulls when excited. He can be reactive when he sees something that startles him, so will need consistent redirection. He is eager to learn and catches on quickly to everything he has been taught so far.\n\nDuke\u2019s ideal family would live in a detached home, outside of the city. He would do best with a fully fenced back yard so he has a secured green space to run and play. He is a loud alert barker so he will not be suitable for an apartment. He thrives with a consistent and predictable routine. He can be skittish and is labelled a flight risk, so even in his back yard will need to be supervised. Duke is dog selective but with proper introductions and supervision he would do well as a second dog. He has not been tested with children but based on his nature would prefer dog savvy children that are ages 10+. Duke is only looking for cat free homes (he will chase them).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Duke please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nDuke\u2019s adoption fee is $850.

This is sweet Mr. Amazing. Very happy and playful boy. Looking for a family to love and a new forever home.\nPrior to adoption I will be altered, vaccinated, health checked, dewormed, and micro-chipped.\nAdoption Fee $400.00+taxes/feesIf you would like to meet me please fill out a pre-adoption application at www.tailsrescue.orgHappy Tails Adoption Center is open on Sundays from 12-5pm. We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me? Click here to fill out an application!Happy Tails Rescue Minnesota is located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley MN 55432. We are open for adoption events from 12-5 every Sunday. If there is a certain animal you want to meet at one the events please fill out a preadoption application to directly contact their foster family or check our Facebook page to see if they will be there! Their event attendance is based on the availability of their foster family.\nHome visits (video tours or in person) are required for all dog adoptions. All of our cats and dogs are INDOOR pets and are NOT to be left outside unattended (even in a fenced yard), or running loose! 2/2/21 12:49 PM",

Even though he is young, he has hip dysplasia and will need FHO surgery, which will be covered by SSR. He is currently looking for a Virginia area foster and could be traveling to Virginia on January 30th. Dudley's FHO surgery is scheduled for February 3rd. Since arriving from Texas on January 30th, he's been a sweet dog and adjusting well with his foster family. He's been very friendly, gentle and likes to play. He sleeps through the night in his play pen. He likes to sleep on his bed as it comforts his leg pain. He's had no accidents in the house yet, so he seems to be potty trained.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

            "description": "Sheba had a rough start and came to us injured, sick, and afraid. But with a little TLC, she has flourished into a sweet, playful pup! She is the definition of a Velcro dog, if she could lay on her foster parents all day long, she would! She does very well with other dogs, but is easily intimidated and prefers to play with her 2 legged family. Sheba is happy to snuggle for hours, but also loves chasing a ball in the backyard, or going for walks. Because of her past, she is timid when meeting new people, but quickly warms up with a few treats! If you are looking for a loyal, loving companion, Sheba is your girl!!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this dog, please complete an application by visiting http://www.floridaurgentrescue.com/adopt.\n\n***Please note that we are a volunteer run organization, and due to the large volume of applications, inquiries, phone calls, emails, and messages received we may not be able to provide a detailed, personal response to every single one. For that reason, formal applications will be given priority over the aforementioned.***\n\nThe adoption fee for dogs 6 months and older is $150; this includes the spay/neuter, microchip, and current vaccinations as of the date of adoption.",

My name is Roxana and I am a 2.5 year old, 55 pound Pit mix girl. I am a calm and reserved girl who enjoys hanging out with my people, whether it's at home, in the car, or out on an adventure. I am very smart, so I am already house trained, crate trained, and I even know some basic commands, like \"sit.\" I am such a sweetheart that I also get along great with other dogs, cats, kids, and even guinea pigs! So, what do you think? Do you think our purposes are meant to intertwine in forever happiness together?\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

A lady had found her running with a heavy chain around her neck and took her in. She surrendered Sky to the local shelter and this couple rescued her from there where she thought she would live happily ever after.\n\nSky is 5 years old and 77 lbs, housebroken, walks on a leash, and is fully crate trained. Sky would love a big fenced in yard, since she is very active, and is used to being outside all day playing and running. She LOVES playing ball so hopefully her new home will have some for her to play with. Sky gets along with other dogs, but her owner said she won't let Sky play with her small dogs since she plays too rough with them although Sky likes the little ones. She likes children too, but is not a fan of cats.\n\nIf you are interested in Sky, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to ask for her by name, SKY SCAS!",

He loves to play fetch and go for walks/ runs. He does best when walked with a harness. Togo is a sweet and loyal boy that loves to love you. He likes other dogs and has been around older children but has never been around cats. Togo enjoys meeting new people but he may try to jump on them. Togo is a good boy that will sit for you and take treats gently from your hand. He loves car rides, does okay in the bath, and loves to play with balls out in yard. Togo would make a great addition to any family willing to dedicate the time and attention it takes to care for a husky. No children under 6. MUST BE EXPERIENCED WITH HUSKIES. All dog adoptions are by appointment only, most purebred pets have a waiting list so please call the shelter at 863-324-5227 to set up your appointment. The shelter is open Tuesday Saturday 10:30-6 closed 1-2 for lunch.",

She needs atleast a 4 foot fence because she will run away and not great on a leash. I rescued her from the shelter/euthanasia at 7 months old. She has been in and out of a home 5 times. Each time was for different amounts of time ranging from a week to a year. Each time she was sent back was due to pregnancy, divorce, her tail hurts (which is now gone), she won't get along with other dogs (absolutely no other dogs can be with her and this is always made very clear!) and a few other terrible reasons. In those times, she also was lost a few times and ended up in the shelter. So many times I thought I'd never see her again. I won't change that again so dont bother inquiring if you can't secure a runner and or handle a special needs dog. She's a great dog that can't hear and would love a home to retire in. She's now coming up on 7 years old.",

She loves to go for walks, chase after toys and most of all - play fetch!. Affectionate and quirky, she:\n\u2022\tIs house trained\n\u2022\tIs good with other dogs\n\u2022\tIs 34 pounds\n\u2022\tWalks nicely on a leash\n\u2022\tEnjoys going for car rides\n\u2022\tLoves to hike\n\u2022\tIs medium to high energy\nBlueberry still has the athleticism to rival a younger dog, but with age she has pleasantly mellowed and is a well mannered companion. She will thrive in an environment that is peaceful but still fairly active. Although she can certainly enjoy a cuddle session, this smart lady loves to DO things and will enjoy a family that likes to take her places and share their world with her.\n\nBlueberry is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative. \n\nFor more information about Blueberry or our shelter please call us at (830) 693-0569 or visit our website at highlandlakescaninerescue.org \n\nIf you would like to schedule a meet and greet with Blueberry or any of our dogs, please fill out an application at highlandlakescaninerescue.org/application-for-adoption\n",

He loves to ride in the car, but he calls out shotgun as you are running outside! Tyson would do best as the only pet and with adults only. He is very food motivated so that helps to continue with his training.

He is potty-trained and loves to nap in a comfy bed. He is a lovable boy that enjoys pets.\n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

After a week or so, he became this confident, strong, friendly and happy dog that he is.\n\nHe knows \"Sit\", \"Stay\", and \"Paw\". He loves to chase toys and play fetch. He is housebroken and is in good shape. He weighs 75 lbs!\n\nWe are looking for a family who understands his breed, strength and personality. A family with patience, time and commitment.\n\nPlease remember, no animal you adopt from a shelter will be perfect for you from day one. We all have to work with his needs and traits and give him a chance to be the pet you want him to be. Know the breed and do your homework so that a successful match can be made.\n\nMeet and greet is highly recommended with all of your family members including furry ones. Let's find him another chance!",

He was in rough shape but after good diet and love he is looking great. He is very friendly and seeks attention. He has a great personality and loves everyone. He is very dog social both big and large. His original home he lived in had cats, but he does bug them and want to play so best with no cats or very dog savvy cats. He is doing well on house and crate training. He needs a family who understands he is a senior and will eventually have a hard time with stairs. \n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

I'm a sweet boy who loves humans of all ages and especially those who offer me treats! I'm a bit selective of who my doggie friends are though, so please bring your doggie to the shelter to come meet me! I've lived in a home before, so I know a thing or two about being a good roommate. I'm ready to be a part of a family again and I'm hoping it's with you! Looking forward to meeting you!\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy! Thanks to Chapman BMW Camelback you can take me home for FREE!\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL says I can live with humans of ALL AGES.\nAAWL says I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE, meaning I need regular exercise.\nAAWL says I MUST MEET potential doggie siblings at the shelter prior to adoption.\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

I'm so excited to see you and play, that I tend to get in others personal space. My education has been a little lacking, but if you're ready to teach and have yummy treats, I'm ready to learn. With time and patience, I can show you just how smart I could be! I'll need a home with kids in their teens or just adults. I need to meet all kids and any other resident dogs before I go home. Johnny will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Johnny A1365583 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

            "description": "This handsome, young boy is definitely a work in progress. Robin is 8 months old and currently weighs 52 pounds. His many attributes include being very smart, lots of energy and a great adventure buddy. Because he is extremely energetic and still working on some much needed manners, Robin will need an adopter that is totally committed to long term positive training which include classes as well as in the home. Robin may look like an adult, but is still very much in puppy mode especially in the home, so his adopter will need to have the flexibility to tweak his training plan as the need arises. Robin is an enthusiastic learner, but will need lots of exercise/playtime to burn off that energy, which will help him focus on training. When he feels settled, he will be a great snuggle friend. This boy enjoys playing with other dogs and should have a good buddy that does not live in the home. He will most likely be able to live with another dog in a few years, but for now he should be the only resident dog in order to work on maturing into the best boy. The same applies to a cat friend, maybe in the future, but not now. Teens that can be committed to keeping Robins training plan consistent, will be considered. The shelter staff is very committed to finding the best home for this good boy and providing additional support to his adopters as needed, to make sure he is successful in the home.

I have partipated in play groups here at the shelter, where I like to socialize and play with other dogs. I could benefit from some obedience classes, where I can learn some commands.

There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

Queso loves his people so much \u2013 he\u2019d really like them to be around most of the time and could use a little help to overcome his separation anxiety. Queso is at his mature size of 60 pounds, and would be well suited to an owner who wants to run, hike, and do all the fun things!  The team at CARE are working on his social skills around other dogs; he may be suitable for a home with another neutral dog, but no kitties. Queso has basic training, is house trained and is a total love bug! If you\u2019re looking for an active pal like Queso, send us a message today!",

It is the most adorable thing ever. She is skittish around new people and takes some time before she trusts you, but is a very loving and gentle girl. She would prefer a home with other dogs who will help her feel more confident. She is medium energy and likes to run around in the backyard from time to time but mostly hangs out on her bed and follows you around. She has a good spirit and will make a good addition to a patient family, as long as they have lots of toys for her!\n\nWinifred is only available for foster-to-adopt at this time. She is heartworm positive and will need to get started on her treatment soon. All medical expenses are taken care of by the rescue when the dog is in foster-to-adopt care. Winifred will have no lasting health issues as a result of her heartworm status. She will be a normal, healthy dog!",

He and his brother Pollie have been together their entire lives and were taken in by a sweet woman in East Texas who has done her best to give them what they need. They are just stronger and more playful than she can handle, so she reached out to us to help find them a wonderful home. We would love for them to stay together or at least have another dog friend to live with.\n\nRollie would love a family with bigger children or a younger active couple. He is very loving, but strong and active. Both Rollie and Pollie are potty trained and need either a fenced yard to run in or someone who can take them on active walks daily.\n\nIf you would like to meet Rollie or Pollie (or both), please fill out an adoption application at www.northstarpets.org and be sure to mention the name of the dog you'd like to meet!",

He has a bump on his side, but not to worry, our vet checked it out and it's just a a fatty lump. He has a heart murmur as. well, but none of this slows him down.

What a great face and those gorgeous eyes! As always, we aren\u2019t sure at all about her breeds- but we know Garnet is energetic and loves to be active.  She will make a great exercise partner and is getting very good on the leash.  Garnet was rescued by Jillian of Training to the Rescue and working with Jillian has been great for this smart and curious babe.  Garnet likes hanging out her daycare.  She gets doggie time and training time, but really is longing for her own family time most! Two-year-old Garnet weighs just under 57lbs and would enjoy visits to the dog park or daycare.  She\u2019ll make a great exercise partner as she loves the outdoors and is ready to accompany you on any and all adventures.   Garnet would benefit from your dog experience as well as your continued training.  Such as \u201cpleaser\u201d she can\u2019t wait to make you happy! Garnet is affectionate, loving and definitely enjoys her people time. She loves kids as well as dogs, but kids should be older as she is fast and might knock a little one down.  Garnet is good in the car, crate trained and house trained. Her beautiful brindle spotted coat is \u2018easy care\u2019 like her! She would love a fenced yard but would be fine with urban living as long as her people were active and got her out and about. But no kitty siblings for this girl. Playful Garnet is enjoying learning games as well as tricks and training- we think she would be great at doggie sports too.  Garnet would be very content at the end of an active day to curl up on the sofa and spend all of her time with you!  She is spayed, micro-chipped and vaccinated and can be visited with her foster mom Jillian. Garnet\u2019s adoption fee is $250 and she is ready and deserving of a truly wonderful home. You just have to meet this adorable and fun-loving girl! Please complete an online application for Garnet at: https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/N1V88edh02ForIB30gCf2. Or for questions, email Jillian at trainingtotherescue@gmail.com.  Get ready for fun and action as well as lots of LOVE and loyalty with grateful Garnet!",

            "description": "I am a happy and affectionate girl. I am on the quiet side, but love attention. I have been around other dogs and kids and have done well with them. They don't know any of my past because I was picked up as a stray. I'm doing well on my crate training, but may need some further work on house training.\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

I would do best in a home with a fenced yard and an active family so I can get the daily exercise I need.  I do great with people of all ages but in my excitement I can sometimes knock smaller kids over.  I haven\u2019t been tested with other dogs or cats at this time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please call 281-291-5644 (leave a message if no answer), email animalcontrol@seabrooktx.gov, or submit an adoption inquiry though this listing!",

Jack is enjoying life now, which is great, as he came to us heart worm positive and had to take it easy for a while.  He has successfully finished his treatment and is ready to find his forever home.  It would be wonderful if he could find a fun and active home, he loves to be on the go and exploring.   Jack has an independent flair too and can entertain himself if he were to have a big back yard, just using his nose and having lots of things to investigate. \n\nThrough no fault of his own, he doesn't appear to have been taught the necessary skills for him to flourish (boundaries, obedience), but with strong leadership, he is smart enough to learn them.  Strong leadership and direction would help this zany boy learn the necessary skills he needs to blossom in a home.   Jack would thrive on not only physical exercise, but also on exercises for his mind, such as nose work and treat puzzles.  Jack is connecting, silly and fun, he is so worth the time if someone could show him the way.   \n\nJack does need to go to an adult only home though, due to the fact that he has some food bowl and rawhide guarding.  He will need an experienced adopter who can continue to work with him on this.  He will also need a home with a fenced in yard that is at least 6 foot high, as we have discovered he is quite the jumper.  With his curiosity and houndy nose, we want to keep him safe. \n\nIf you are interested in Jack and are at least 21 years old, please fill out an application at K9stray.com and we will be in touch.  \n\n\n",

            "description": "Hi I\u2019m Leeta. I\u2019m an active and playful pup of about 9 months. I\u2019m told I\u2019m a heeler beagle mix about 28 pounds. I love cuddles and my humans. My foster mom says I have lots of energy so I will need a big fenced in yard. An active sibling would be great too! Oh, and walks. I love walks! I love toys and bones of any kind. I even ring the bell to go outside, and sleep through the night. I do know some commands but I am told I\u2019m still working on my manners. So if I sound like a good fit to your family, I would love to come stay forever.\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425. This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

            "description": "Buster is a very good boy! He is 8 years young, and despite a sedentary beginning he has decided that running is fun, (but only for short periods of time). He loves his daily walks more than anything (well, expect food, and his people). Buster\u2019s original owner was an older man who, sadly, had to move into a nursing home due to dementia. During this process, Buster was left in a boarding kennel for 5 long months. Eventually, the family decided that no one wanted to take in this sweet boy, so he is now single and looking for a long-term commitment. Before going to a home, Buster\u2019s owner often forgot that he had already been fed, so Buster is currently on a weight loss program. He is down to approximately 80 pounds, but still has a few more to go. Fortunately, he loves walking and playing.  Despite being an only dog for his entire life, Buster has realized that having dogs around if fun (as long as they don\u2019t try to eat his food!) and is learning how to play for the first time. He has been around cats his entire life and doesn\u2019t seem to mind them. He likes children when he meets them on the street but has never lived with kids in the home before. As an older fellow you don\u2019t have to worry about potty accidents or inappropriate chewing. He loves to play but is also happy just settling down by your feet for a nap. This guy is a champ! He is polite and good on a leash. He is not currently being crated, but he is such a good boy that it hasn\u2019t been necessary.  Buster is now ready to start a new adventure with his new family.  He is so deserving of a family of his own and will make an excellent companion.  Do you have room in your home and heart for Buster?\n\nAre you interested in adopting Buster or another JCAPL pet you have seen? You'll need to start by completing an adoption application, available online at our website: www.jcapl.org. There is no obligation to adopt by completing an application, however, we do recommend submitting an application as soon as you find an animal you are interested in. We review applications in the order they are received.\n\nCompleted applications can be sent via email to adopt@jcapl.org , faxed to 919-300-5524 or delivered in person by visiting us at one of our adoption events on Saturdays at PetSmart in Garner (White Oak Shopping Center). \n\nWe will contact you as soon as possible once we receive your application.\n\nThanks for thinking adoption!",

She would be a great walking buddy. She is spayed, vaccinated, chipped, and ready for adventures with you!  Her adoption fee is $165 \n\nThank you for your interest in a rescued pet! Due to Covid-19 we are now open by appointment. If you would like to set up a time to meet one of our pets, please fill out an adoption application here: www.midwestanimalresq.org/app\n\nOnce we receive your application, we will be in touch to schedule a time for you to come and meet the pet. Thanks again for your interest in a rescued pet, and for being flexible in these changing times.\n\nAll of our adult pets go on a 2 week trial adoption to make sure they are a perfect fit for your family!",

Smoochie is a two year Pit/Sharpei mix that can be quite the diva and will need to be the only pet in her new home. She loves to play and run around so this girls new home will require a fenced in yard to make sure she is safe while off leash. She definitely thinks she is part lap dog and will require some snuggle time to help ease her need for attention. Smoochie will definitely give you all the furry love she has in return for as long as you are willing to take it. If you think you might want to meet Smoochie and any of our other dogs please apply for adoption today!!!",

However, I weigh about 55 pounds, so I'm having to learn better leash manners and how to control my enthusiasm when meeting new people. Thus, some obedence classes could be helpful. I'm really a sweet boy and enjoy playing with other dogs here at the shelter that can handle my exuberance. For more information or to set up an appointment to meet adoptable animals, please call the Jackson County Animal Shelter at 541-774-6654. My adoption fee is $150, plus $25 for an annual dog license, if you live in Jackson County.",

            "description": "01/23/21 Spirit returned to the shelter as a stray after getting loose from her owner almost immediately after being adopted. Spirit was on the lam for almost 2 weeks before a citizen was able to get ahold of her and return her to the shelter. During that time, Spirit had been periodically returning to the owner's home to eat food that was left out for her, but she would not come inside or allow herself to be caught. Despite being quite friendly at the shelter, Spirit should still be considered a skittish dog, who, if left off leash or uncontained, WILL RUN. Spirit's adoptive owner did not elect to redeem her, so she is available for adoption again, but she will need an extremely vigilant owner who will keep her on leash, inside, or otherwise appropriately contained (a chain and dog house or a secure run) at all times. A fenced yard may not be adequate, particularly if she is unsupervised. We have heard from two other adoptive owners that adopted dogs from this group. One dog appears to be adjusting well into his home, the other dog was lost. PLEASE ask a lot of questions and do research on Alaskan Huskies prior to adopting Spirit. We at the shelter like her very much, but she should not be considered a 'normal' house pet at this time. Spirit does keep her kennel clean! 12/29/20 Spirit was surrendered to the shelter because her previous owner could not take care of her or many of the other dogs they had. She has lived outside her entire life and will need help adjusting to be an indoor dog. We do not know if she is trained for mushing or skijoring. She does not know any commands, and does not know her name. She needs a kind and patient person to work with her on some basic doggy skills. When first meeting her she can be shy and reserved, but is easily won over with good treats and sweet words. She is incredibly sweet and affectionate to her animal tenders and loves getting petted. She does like to jump up on people when she greets them and give them a hug. Spirit likes the company of other dogs and does get a little sad if she is the only dog. We do not know how Spirit will do with cats, or other small pets. She is an Alaskan Husky, who are known to have high prey drives, so please take caution when introducing any other animals to her. Spirit is an escapee, and will need to be in a fenced yard or kept on leash when outside so she does not go on the run! Spirit is here patiently waiting for a special someone to give her a loving forever home.",

            "description": "In memory of Mike and Laura Bysiek.Sisters Jean (Mike) Gonska and Lorraine (Larry) Diggs, wanted to leave a lasting legacy in memory of their loving parents by establishing the Mike & Laura Bysiek Memorial Fund at the Cattaraugus Region Community Foundation to support a number of nonprofit organizations in the community each year.\nAs long-time active volunteers at Joyful Rescues and seeing the amazing, awe-inspiring, life-saving, tireless work that is done every day there, it was a wonderful option to be able to sponsor a life-saving pet transport annually in their honor.\nMindy was born around September 7, 2020, and might top out in the 15-20 pound range. Mindy was surrendered to a high kill shelter in the south along with 11 other dogs from the same home. For breeds, we feel they are mostly Chia/Terrier mixes but there are likely a dozen more breeds mixed in. They get along wonderfully with the other dogs and have sweet, happy, dispositions. You will likely have some housetraining to do but it shouldn't take long as they seem eager to please and are smart little cookies. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you!\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

They connected with one of our volunteers and after looking unsuccessfully for an owner she came into our rescue.\n\nSTORY is a young, athletic dog with a high prey drive. She is smart and listens well to a strong, confident leader. She is a rough and rowdy player with dogs and is learning how to play nicely - just like with humans, she would do well with an older confident dog who can teach her some manners.  STORY is unlearning some bad \"puppy\" habits like jumping up and mouthing so we suggest a home with no kids or high school aged and above. \n\nSTORY is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and crate-trained. She weighs about 60lbs. \n\nSee additional video: https://www.instagram.com/p/CKAF9lZn7YD/\n\nIf you are in the Los Angeles area and interested in meeting STORY, please fill out our brief online questionnaire (copy and paste link): www.downtowndogrescue.org/adoption-questionnaire\n\nAdditional Downtown Dog Rescue information email: adopt@downtowndogrescue.org or call: 818-407-4145\n",

She gets nervous with too many people around and prefers a quiet home where she can really connect to her people. She takes time to come out of her shell, but you will feel very special once she lets you in. Windy has lived a long, hard life and just wants a family who will let her retire with them. Though she is older, she has a forever puppy face and doesn't have any health concerns. She is low maintenance and low key. Windy is the perfect dog for an older person who wants a companion. \n\nWindy is comfortable around all dogs and is also compatible with cats. She is completely vetted and not on any medications/supplements. Windy was living in an abandoned house with 43 other dogs before she was rescued, so you can understand how living in a real home is a whole new experience for her. She is being fostered in Fort Worth, TX.",

In typical Lab fashion, Jackson enjoys getting all the pets he can, seeing where his nose will take him and begging for all the treats he can in between. A big goof ball, you can often find Jackson rolling on his back in the snow, and cracking volunteers and staff up with his antics. A great mix of active and affectionate, we're sure that Jackson would make a great addition to any home, you just need to meet him!\n\nCOMPATIBILITY: Based on our evaluation, we feel that Jackson has the potential to get along with other dogs.

            "description": "Koda is a 7 year old Newfoundland mix guy.  This big, beautiful guy is looking for someone to grow old with.  If you are looking for a lover, he is your dog... He loves to snuggle, and cuddle and spoon, he leans in and makes you feel loved and warm and comfy surrounded by his thick beautiful fur. He will do best in an all adult home or one with older respectful kids. He will get grumpy with kids (has snapped at foster\u2019s son when he petted him on the nose) and he also likes to chase things that run. \nKoda is most happy sleeping in the room with you and he will sleep in until you're ready to get up (gotta love that!). He loves to be adored and he will adore you right back.  He likes to hang with you all day, being where you are in the house though he doesn't mind laying on the deck if the weather is nice for a nap.  And he can be left alone in the house just fine, doesn't destroy or pee, just waits. He is very strong, does pull on the leash pretty hard but we do have a new halter and leash he comes with to help with that. He sits, stays, lays down and shakes-- all very well.  He wants to do whatever you ask him to so he gets a treat or pet and he takes treats gently. \nKoda\u2019s previous owners said he is also very protective, especially when on his property so a fence (not invisible/electric fence) is a must to protect those very important delivery drivers and unexpected guests.  A busy house with a lot of people coming and going is probably not the best fit for this guy.  With the right situation, he could make someone very, very, happy.  He will do best in a home where his humans don\u2019t need to regularly leave him alone long hours.  In the past Koda has lived with cats peacefully.  He weighs 90 lbs. \n(A $250 adoption fee is required.) \nIf you are interested in this dog, please go to the Adopt page of our website where you will find a link to an adoption application form  https://www.chewdogrescue.org/index.php/component/rsform/form/5-adoption-application-form\n \nIf you have previously submitted an application form, there is no need to re-apply. Just let us know you're interested in this dog. We do our best to match families and dogs so everyone is pleased and the placement is permanent. We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if the home situation is incompatible with the needs of the rescue dog. Rescue is about doing our best for the dog. We do home and reference checks.  All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and are up to date with current vaccinations, before being placed in their forever homes.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED! We are always looking for good foster homes. Our rescue is foster based and we can always save more dogs if we have foster homes for them to go into. It is not a long term commitment. We have been able to find good forever homes in a short time. We also welcome volunteers who can help transport dogs and help with our outreach and fund raising efforts. Please contact us if you can help.",

This beauty is a bit shy and fearful when meeting new people and will take quite a bit of time to warm up to you. She will need someone with the time and patience to help build her confidence. If you have children in the home, it is REQUIRED that they be age 14 years or older. She also would like to be your one and only canine companion, as she's just not a fan of other dogs. Maya may be most successful in a home with a small household size, committed to utilizing positive training strategies to continue to modify shy/fearful behavior, and in a \"quiet\" area where Maya will not frequently be exposed to other dogs, whether on leash or through fence-lines (that said, apartment life might not be Maya's jam). If you're willing to do this for her, Maya will reward you with her loyalty and lots of smiles and tail wags! So that said, if you have what it takes, make an appointment to learn more about Maya today! Primary Color: Brown Weight: 57.6lbs Age: 4yrs 1mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

We are looking for a patient family, with a lot of love and experience with the Rottweiler breed. \n\nSince being here at the shelter, it is obvious that Onyx is a nervous boy who lacks confidence and trust in humans. Staff has truly fallen for his gentle soul, quirky personality and eagerness to please. \n\nOnyx is estimated to be almost 2 years old and is a BIG boy. He is neutered, UTD on shots and will be microchipped. Due to his uncertainty and lack of trust, families must be committed to ongoing training and positive socialization in order to show Onyx that people are indeed here to love him and provide a home  of security.\n\nIf interested in giving Onyx a safe, quiet and loving home, please fill out an application at www.lebanonhumane.org and email it to info@lebanonhumane.org",

            "description": "\"A good friend\u00a0listens to your adventures; a best friend makes them with you!\" My name is Truman and I am great at making friends, but now I am looking for my forever best friend! I am a 3 year old, 75 pound Lab mix boy. Like I said, I love making new friends and I get along with other dogs and humans of all ages. I am a playful and energetic boy who is still working on leash manners, so I am looking for an active family with\u00a0a fully privacy fenced yard in which to get daily exercise (no apartments for me please). I am already house trained and, while I may not be fully kennel trained yet, it won't take a smart and eager to please boy like myself too long to get the hang of it. When I went to the dogtor, they told me that I have something called heartworms, so I have to go through treatment to get rid of those icky things, but I should be available to join your family around the end of April or first part of May! I can not wait to be your new best friend!\n\nI am currently\u00a0enrolled in the Pups 4 Parole training program and am learning all sorts of cool things to make me a great addition to your family. I need someone who will keep up with my training so I don't forget all of the cool things I am learning!\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Boone has lots of puppy energy and wants to play outside. He would do  best in a home with a fenced yard that he can access easily without too many stairs and a dog buddy. He loves other dogs and loves people.  \n\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it.

She\u2019s a little shy at first with new people but warms up quickly and loves snuggles, belly rubs and giving kisses.  She\u2019s doing great with potty training and learning her basic commands.  \n\nInterested in meeting Violet? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

Raw is a male, neutered, shepherd mix, about 7 years old.  He came to the shelter very underweight and while the scale still has a ways to go to normal he has been improving in condition.  Despite his imposing size and vocal nature this boy has been a real love with all the people at the shelter and seems to enjoy children.  Out in the yard with a ball he is joy to play with and fairly well mannered despite his somewhat goofy nature.  In the kennels he has been mostly neutral toward the other dogs.  In the play yards he has been good with most of the shelter dogs fence to fence but does respond to a direct challenge in a dominant manner.  He has paid no mind to our shelter cat or to the rooster who was temporarily housed here last week. \n \nUnfortunately Raw is heartworm positive.  Due to his age, size, severity of his heartworms and his energetic personality he will be a challenge for treatment.  We are currently working through options with our vets and would be happy to discuss those with anyone interested in placement.  Don't let the potential challenges make up your mind if you are considering Raw because this boy has the drive to make anything happen.

She's very affectionate and playful. She hasn't been tested with cats of children, and she can be selective with other dogs. She has done well with a laid back male dog with several slow, proper introductions.\n\nVal would do well with an active family and a backyard. She is currently on medication for anxiety and will likely need continued use.  She is crate trained, but currently requires a heavy duty crate due to her anxiety. She's a very sweet dog that just wants to be in your pocket at all times!\n\nVal has her own Instagram and would love for you to check it out! @phbt_val\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website: www.phillybullyteam.com",

This boy craves love and attention. Thor does well with children who know how to be calm around dogs, he gets nervous around loud screaming kids! Thor seems a little scared of his tail\u00a0being grabbed at all but does not bite he just tucks his butt and cries! Thor is such a sweet loving boy who sleeps in the bedroom on a dog bed at night and does very well with dogs of all sizes! He's super playful and loving he takes a couple of days to calm down once he's in a new environment! He is so worth the patience and love!\n\nIf you are interested in adoption; DO NOT CALL, please complete an online application on 4 Paws Animal Rescue's website at www.4pawz.org. We verify the care of past/current pets as well as home information. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs and cats, and therefore, we reserve the right to approve or deny an application based on what we determine is in the pet's best interest.",

Plus she can help you work from home while you work on your laptop! \n\nJaina would do best as the only pet in home as she\u2019s a bit dog selective (no cats) but may be okay with the right dog after VERY slow intros. \n\nJaina is thriving in her loving fosters home - she\u2019s ready for the next step now, finding her forever family!  Visit CaneRossoRescue.org to apply to bring this fun gal home today! \n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . Her adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home.

When meeting other dogs Azul has displayed he is a bit of a macho man and can show dominant tendicies. However we feel he generally does well with dogs after some time. He has also shown that he would also do best with no small animals (cat, rabbits, Guinea pigs) in the household. He would do best in an adult only home.",

If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com.

He is good with all dogs and cats but most of all, he loves to be with his people. Danner can be shy with men at first, but with patience and love soon warms up! Danner will do better with older kids. We are working with him on basic commands, house training and crate training. Danner is fully vetted, vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nWe will require Danner to be in basic obedience training within 30 days of adoption. Basic obedience training is very important and a great opportunity for Danner and his family to learn new sign commands, reinforce good manners and bond with each other!\n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com\n",

This girl defied all odds after being left to die in the woods- sick and alone. She came back from the brink of death and is unstoppable now! This girl is full of spunk! Her foster describes her as amazing and loveable. Dasher is super friendly and gets along with dogs of all sizes. She has not been around a cat yet. She also adores kids but due to her puppy energy- kids ages 8 and older are probably best right now. She is crate trained and working on potty training. She absolutely loves her toys and to play tug of war! If Dasher sounds perfect to you- we'd love to hear from you! Please fill out an application on our website at: www.pupandcatco.comWe do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available. Dogs going to adoption event are typically posted on our Facebook page the day prior.\n\nDetails about our adoption procedures can be seen at www.pupandcatco.com.",

She loves to play with any toy and gets along great with other dogs in the home. She is only 7 months so she would love someone who is willing to work with her on potty training and commands. Would do well in a home with another dog to teach her the ropes.\n\nInterested in meeting Roxy? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Hi I'm Dakota. I'm a 7yr old Border Collie (my foster mom believes I'm pure breed). I'm a very good dog but I've also had a rough life. Sometime last year I was dumped in a field, I found a nice old lady to cared for me until she passed and then I was surrendered to a rescue due to some of my behavior issues which my foster mom is working with me on. \n\nMy foster mom says I'm a very good dog except I need to work on my possessiveness when getting attention (I just LOVE getting pets and attention) around other dogs. I also have an issue with getting brushed and my collar (when its off). My foster mom says that the way I react when these things are out suggests I may have had a bad experience with these objects. I tend to run and hide or growl when I can't escape. But my foster mom as slowly been working with me on these two things. I really am a sweet dog and my foster mom is teaching me to communicate without fleeing, nipping or growling. I told you my negatives now let's look at my positives! \n\nSince being in my foster home I've been the best dog I can be. I'm completely house trained. Never ever made a potty mess, I don't chew or destroy anything, i don't get into the trash. I take treats very gently, and I'm not pushy when it comes to meal time. I hardly jump on people and the rare times I do, I do that gently too. I love to snuggle and be with my person. I've got a very mellow personality for a 7yr old Border Collie. I am not kennel trained, and not used to being on a leash but those can be worked with. \n\nMy foster mom is working with me on my negatives, but will suggest any family that's interested in me to look into getting a trainer to help me in my new home. \nMy perfect home would be as an only dog (even though I'm good with dogs outside, I get possessive inside), and I would really like my dream home to be feline and small kiddo free. I may be a little rough around the edges but I'll make a great companion if given the chance.\nIf you think you may be interested in me please, put in an application in at Pawsitivetailskc.org and come meet me and see!",

            "description": "Frankie (named after Clemson's Frank Howard Field) is a sweet puppy who came to us in a litter with her 4 sisters and her 2 brothers. Her mother is a large, brown/fawn colored dog and her father is unknown. It is likely that the puppies from this litter have several different fathers because they all look so different! Our best guess is that Frankie is a Wirehaired Terrier mix and that she will be a large dog when she is fully grown. \n\nMost of our pets are obtained from animal control and therefore we are not certain of their breed or breed mix.  We list breed mixes that they most resemble or that their former owners said they were.  However, we don't make any guarantees about breed - it is a best guess!\nTo meet one of our adoptable pets or to start the adoption process, please access the adoption application on our website, www.crossroadsanimalrescue.org or download and email it to crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com. We will then approve you (sending in the application does not obligate you to adopt) and we can set up a time for you to meet one or more of our pets. You can then pay the adoption fee and officially adopt after meeting your new family member. Alternatively, you can do the adoption over the phone before meeting your new pet. The benefit to this is that we will hold the pet for you. However, the adoption fee is non-refundable if you changed your mind after adopting over the phone.\n\nOur adoption fees include the spay/neuter surgery, deworming, vet exam, and up to date vaccines. It also includes microchipping as well as heartworm testing or feline leukemia testing. We are happy to adopt out-of-state (and even out of the country!) but transportation for the adopted pet is the responsibility of the new pet owner.\n\nIf you cannot adopt a pet at this time but would like to support our rescue, please click on the \"Sponsor a Pet\" button. Your donation will help feed the dogs, cats, small animals, and horses at CARE.\nPlease email at crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com or call us at (864)972-9906 for more information. This phone number will reach Crossroads Animal Hospital, which is the home of CARE. During business hours, a receptionist will be able to speak with you regarding our adoptable pets. After business hours, the only way to contact CARE is via email. Our puppies and kittens are also eligible for 10% off the rest of the vaccines in their puppy/kitten vaccination series at Crossroads Animal Hospital. Most adult pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Puppies and kittens may have the surgery before adoption or we may have new owners return later for the surgery. For more information about CARE and to see our adoption application, go to our website, www.crossroadsanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Cornelia is back with Furkids through no fault of her own. For a short period of time, she stayed with a family until she could get back to us. She is friendly and loving and gets along well with other dogs, cats and horses. She seems to like most people and children, too. She prefers to sleep on the sofa or bed instead of a crate. Cornelia needs lots of exercise and would rather run free with her nose to the ground (she's a Hound!), so a fenced in yard is a must for Cornelia. She is currently undergoing treatments for heartworm disease. Until she has completed her treatments and is fully recovered, she is available for adoption only in the Atlanta area; she must be able to come to Furkids' shelter for treatments. Cornelia is 5 yrs. old (est. birth date 5/10/2015), 62 pounds, and her adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Cornelia, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

Potential adopters should know that they are NOT house-trained. Marley and Gizmo are freshly groomed and just received dentals from our vet, so they are all set for a new home! To adopt this adorable duo, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Hello I am Gabby a 3-year-old female blue nose pitbull.  I was a breeding dog until someone picked me up as a stray.  The shelter spayed me after the required 5 day holding period.  After being at the shelter for 10 days, my owner called to claim me but did not want me back because I was already spayed.  I am a high energy gal who is super smart and super sweet.  I love all people and playing ball.  Due to my high energy, it is probably best if I am in a home with older or no kids.  I do need to be the only dog in the house because I never learned to play properly, and I overreact to playing.  In addition, I am a jealous of other dogs and want all the attention for myself.  I am not reactive at all to other dogs while outside on my leash, but I am not going to be a good dog park dog.  If you are looking for a sweet gal with a lot of energy, I could be your gal!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me please apply at www.odaatcolorado.com",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses.

I am a nervous, hesitant boy, but I love food and will warm up quickly with it. Since I am nervous, I would do best in a home with no exposure to children as they will be too much. Basic Obedience would really help me build some confidence. I do enjoy the company of other dogs, but we would have to meet before I go to a home. Fill out an inquiry to come meet me!",

She's not very hyper and would be a great fit if you just want a laid-back companion. She knows how to sit and smile pretty. \n\nUnless otherwise stated, the adoption fees for dogs over 5 months range from $50-$175. Puppies under 5 months are $175.00.  Dog adoption fees include a microchip. \n\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\n\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.org.

It sure is cold here in WI but I'm getting used to it and I love to wear sweaters to keep warm. I also love to snuggle and have a lot of belly rubs! Right now I live with 2 crazy Chihuahuas and cats. I like to play with the chi-chis and totally ignore the cats. I had a sleep over at a friend's house and she had big dogs. We played really well together after we got to know each other. My foster mom and everyone who meets me tell me that I am one of the sweetest dogs ever. Of course I am, after all, I'm a beautiful girl from Texas! I'm doing really well with house training. Foster mom has us all in a routine but some times it's just so cold and I don't want to go out. She makes me though, that bully! ;-) She says if chihuahuas from TN can do it, certainly a girl from TX can. I love car rides, squeaky toys, I play fetch too, and know that 'give' means to drop my toy so it can be thrown for me. I sit super nice for treats and IF I can say so myself - I have THE cutest head tilt! I am learning that being in a loving house is so much better than being pregnant and living behind a dumpster.\nI need someone who wants to continue my training along with giving me belly rubs and lots of cuddles! If you are looking for a smaller bundle of joy to complete your family, I am your gal!\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.",

When I got here I was a little nervous and scared but I have really opened up. I love treats and peanut butter so you can give me some and I know we'll be friends. I'm very soft and love being pet so much that I'll give you lots of kisses in return. I will need lots of practice on learning good manners and would benefit from obedience classes. I'm looking for a patient family who can help me settle into my new life & make sure that I learn my manners. I'm hoping my new home comes with lots of soft places to relax. Think you have the right home for me? Come meet me at Woodford Humane or call 859-873-5491 to find out more about me! \n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 43.6lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

He does love to play fetch, but you have to be careful as he will jump on you and do whatever he can to get the ball. \n\nOpie responds very well to correction and will need an adopter that can stand their ground with him. He does very well with correction. He also knows a couple basic commands. He has proven that he is a smart and knows how to \"sit\"! He sat beautifully for his picture as you can see! \n\nHe does need some work, but with the right adopter he will go far! Opie is very housebroken when taken out regularly. \n\nOpie loves treats and will do anything for them! His cage presence is a little overwhelming when people come to visit, but he is a great dog outside of his cage. We think that he would be okay with older children, but he is just too strong for small children.",

Due to unfortunate circumstances and covid, they are now up for adoption. They will be approximately 2 years old in March and originally rescued from Mississippi by Red Rock. Lady Mary has the curly thicker hair and Lady Edith has more of the lab appearance. They are bonded sisters and do everything together - eat, sleep, and play. They are great with cats, children of all ages, and love to run and play outside. This fun loving pair would be a great addition to just about any home.\n\nThe girls weigh about 50 pounds each . 2/1/21 5:30 PM",

She has the prettiest honey brown eyes and is a major snuggler. She loves nesting on top of piles of laundry and following me around the house like a little shadow. She\u2019s housebroken, great on a leash, and doesn\u2019t have any major behavioral issues we\u2019ve encountered thus far. She definitely gets along well with other dogs but is quite an independent young lady. I think she\u2019d do well in a household with or without dogs, with or without children. Overall, this gal is super easy going and is so sweet, no doubt whoever meets her will fall in love with her. This sweetheart is ready for a forever home! \n\nThis dog is a Benefactor Dog. His/her increased adoption fee will allow them to act as a benefactor to other dogs in our care that require special medical care and a better chance at adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (that application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\n The adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale:\nBenefactor Puppies under 12 months - $500\nBenefactor Dogs over 12 months - $400\n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for.

If you elect to contact us via e-mail it may take several weeks for us to get back to you.  Renters must provide proof that you are allowed to have a dog.  Please be prepared to provide a vet reference prior to adoption. \n\nIs there room in your heart for this sweet little dog in need? Helen is diabetic and being held in a vet clinic after being surrendered by her owner.  The owner could not afford treating her diabetes so just ignored it.  Diabetes is not something that can be ignored without consequences and the consequence for this little girl is she has very limited eyesight.  She does best in familiar places where she knows where things are.  The people at the vet clinic say she is just the nicest girl and they are hoping we can find a home for her.  She is about 6 years old and weighs about 35#.  She is in South Dakota and will be transported to Saint Paul if we can find a home for her.   PUP will cover the cost of insulin for Helen for two years.   \n\nHelen has been vet checked, wormed and vaccinated. PUP will have her spayed prior to placement.",

            "description": "Mustang Sally came to us in January 2021 from a partner shelter down in Georgia. She was found as a stray, but due to multiple failed attempts to catch her, she evaded capture for over a year! Due to her lack of socialization, she can be very timid and easily startled with new people and situations, so she'd do best in a home with very little activity level. Once she warms up and becomes more comfortable, she is the sweetest girl and tends to get very playful! She loves treats and big fluffy blankets, and will be your absolute best friend if you happen to feed her french fries! Mustang Sally is said to be dog friendly, but would need to meet another dog in the home prior to adoption.\n\n*Heartworm Positive*\n\nIf interested in adopting Mustang Sally, please submit an online adoption application! Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment. Once we receive and review your application, we will contact you to schedule an appointment. Thank you!",

Stu can be a bit grumpy at times but we can't blame him! At almost 8 years old, Stu came to us very overweight and clearly had not been taken care of in a long time. \n\nStu has proven to be more of an independent type guy, who doesn't solicit a whole lot of attention from his human pals here at the shelter. He also would love a home where there are no children under the age of 16. As far as doggy friends, any families interested in Stu, would have to participate in a dog meet and greet at the shelter to ensure a good fit. \n\nLooking for a Netflix and Chill kind of guy? Look no futher!\n\nIf interested in adopting Stu, please fill out an adoption application at www.lebanonhumane.org and email it to info@lebanonhumane.org",

            "description": "Bowie is a female approximately 8-10 month old 45 lb mixed breed (possibly catahoula, lab, heeler) found after being dumped on the side of the road. This sweet girl is a little shy at first, but after a few minutes getting to know you, she is the friendliest pup. She loves fetch (seriously, she will play for hours if you don\u2019t get tired), going on walks, and snuggling on the couch. She wants to go everywhere with her foster family and LOVES the car and sticking her head out the window. She does not chew, but definitely benefits from having a few toys around to play with. She is great with other dogs and has been around a cat and was curious, but not reactive. Unknown how she would be with kids, but given her calm nature, she would likely do well. Due to being abandoned, Bowie does not like being without a companion or left alone, so she would do best with a family who can give her lots of love, attention, and play time. Bowie is spayed and heart worm negative. This amazing girl has had a tough first few months of her life and is ready to settle down in her forever home!This sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

You know that saying...more to love! He definitely loves people. And treats. He was an absolute perfect model for his photo shoot when promised a treat at the end of it. This young man would love to have a family to share their time with him, love him and of course give him yummy treats, too. Email humanesociety@hsscg.org for an application for this gentle soul. He is neutered, microchipped, current on core vaccines and has tested negative for heartworms.",

I am housebroken.\u00a0 I love car rides, playing with my foster sister, toys and I especially love my bones.\u00a0 In my downtime, I enjoy being on my person\u2019s lap or lounging in my bed.\u00a0 I am still a little itchy because of my skin condition and I am looking for someone that will continue with my weekly medicated baths, ear wash and ear drops.\u00a0 I do take Apoquel daily. If you have room in your heart and home for me, the link to fill out an application is below.\u201d\n\nOur adoption process starts with our application. Once the application is approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home visit usually last 1-1 1/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the 2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and all except $100.00 {$75 if Senior} of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial, you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION FEE's:\nPuppies under 6 months:  $199.00\nAdults:  $150.00\nSeniors (over 7 yrs):  $99.00\n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please fill out an application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/193425528783165",

Scooby has a goofy, gregarious personality, and will definitely keep is people laughing with his puppy antics. He would love for his new family to take him on long walks at the park, and throw the ball for him in the backyard each day. Scooby loves to play fetch, and does a good job bringing the ball back after each throw! \n\nScooby is an active, rambunctious fellow who needs a family ready to spend the time and energy needed to teach him all the things \"grown up\" dogs need to know. He is a clever pup, and would benefit from training classes to help him channel all his energy into becoming a model canine citizen. This sweet boy is treat motivated, and eager to please. \n\nHis foster reports, \"I would say Scooby is definitely a people person - he loves being next to his me at all times and loves physical touch. When sitting on the couch, he loves to lay on my lap or sit next to me and be as close as possible. Scooby likes to have naps during the day and will do so either on the couch next to me or on his dog bed. He also LOVES to cuddle with me in bed.\"\n\nScooby is reported to be house broken, and his foster reports he has good home manners. Because Scooby's manners around people when he gets excited are a work in progress, he will do best in a home with teenage children. His foster says, \"Overall, Scooby has surprised me at well behaved he is. He is a very loving dog and just wants to be with me at all times during the day.\" \n\nWith a bit of time and patience, this dashing puppy will be a fantastic canine companion to whichever family is lucky enough to adopt him. If Scooby sounds like the right fit for your household, schedule an adoption appointment today!",

She arrived to the shelter after being found as a stray and unfortunately, her family never came looking for her. \n\nSince being here at the shelter, Larayna has shown just how sweet and loving of a gal she really is! Staff provide praise for her manners and her wonderful behavior, despite the busy shelter environment. \n\nLarayna is looking for a family who has plenty of time to spend with her. She would enjoy an active family, with lots of time to give. If your family is interested in Larayna and has another dog, a meet and greet would need to be completed in order to ensure an appropriate fit.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application on our website at www.lebanonhumane.org and email it to info@lebanonhumane.org",

I can be a scared of new people at first, but with a little patience, I'm in your lap giving kisses. I also love to play fetch and am even really good at bringing the ball back and dropping it! I don't have a sense of personal space and don't seem to know my size, so I would like to meet any children in the home prior to adoption. I am also interested in other dogs, however, just like I don't know personal space with people, I don't know personal space with other dogs. For this reason, I would like to meet any dogs in the home prior to adoption to make sure they tolerate me. If you would like to add an affectionate snuggle buddy to your family, make an appointment to meet me today!",

Our understanding is that once hunters no longer need the animal or he/she isnt hunting properly they leave them in the woods to fend for themselves :( \nBurt is estimated to be about 10 years old, 42 pounds and fully vetted.\nBurt loves to play with dogs and kids. He doesn\u2019t mind cats. He runs up smiling for pets and his missing bottom teeth pop out adding extra character to this gentle elder.\nBurts days consist of playing and napping. He is a wonderful family companion. Burt does have a tendency to dig so a fenced yard is preferred with a family who will oversee him at all times. He was so happy to show his foster dad how he got into the neighbors yard :) since he does so well with cats, dogs and kids, those applications will be considered first.\nBurt will counter surf so basic training classes are highly recommended.\nOur application can be found on our website on the available dogs page.\nThank you!",
