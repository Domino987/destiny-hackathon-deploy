They are ready to play at the drop of a hat but happy to hang out on the couch when they are done.  They will be a loyal devoted companion and exploring buddy.  We ask for a secured dedicated fenced yard and someone who has \"at home\" time during the day to further their training and socializing.  Please email 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net to receive our pre-adopt form which starts the process so you can meet her.\n",

            "description": "Here is Isla!\n\nIsla and her sisters, Cordelia and Lana, are about 4-5 months old and they are very special pups.  They spent the first 3 months of their lives outside under their owners porch. Luckly, someone called animal control and they were seized. The siblings were taken to an over populated shelter and the shelter called us to help.  FHDR transported the pups to NJ to live in foster homes.  They are very happy to be in a foster home where they are getting healthy food & treats, soft beds and lots of love. Something they never experienced before.  The pups are very shy but so very sweet and they are learning to trust people. \n\nIsla foster mom says\u2026.\u201dIsla is gorgeous.  She has beautiful haze eyes and a beautiful brown coat.  Isla was very shy when she arrived at our house but she is making a lot of progress. She will now will come over to us and she will give us puppy kisses.  Isla spends her days playing with all sorts of toys (ring toys, rope toys, sneaky toys, stuffed toys and kong) and she loves her balls (small, large squishy ones).  Isla will toss her toys up in the air and then chases after them. She will also play fetch with her the balls and return them.  Isla will follow us around and she likes relaxing on her doggie bed or sitting outside in the sun. She is very silly puppy who runs around the house when she has the zoomies and getting into stuff. LOL!  Isla rolls over for belly rubs all the time.  And, she does this cute thing where she slides from a sit position to a laying position. LOL!  Isla sleeps through the night without having accidents and she is doing really good with house training. She already know the comands sit, paw, down, come and no. She is food motivated and very obedient for a puppy.  Isla is a vocal puppy, she has a little whine that sounds like a bird chirping. She is very cute and the sounds are adorble!!\"\n\nIsla needs a home that has the patience to make her feel comfortable and that can spend time teaching her that they are safe.  (No children under 15 years old.) are sure if you adopt her, she will be devoted, loving companion.  She just need the right person to call their own. Isla is just a Love!\n\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

I haven't had the most stable home situation for a while and I'm really hoping that will change soon. I know my forever family is out there, looking for a sweet girl like me. It may take me a few minutes to warm up to new people, but once I know you, I am playful and affectionate. I'd love to continue working on my confidence in my forever home, I just need some love and praise. I am treat motivated as well and have already learned to \"sit\" and \"shake.\" I love to play with toys and one of my favorite toys is a Kong stuffed with goodies. A fun fact about me: I'm bilingual and know my commands in Spanish! Please call the Humane Society of North Iowa at 641-423-6241 for more information.\n\nAdoption fee covers the following veterinarian\u00a0services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriate\u00a0vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, and heartworm test for dogs.",

            "description": "Say Hi to Cordelia!\n\nCordelia and her sisters, Lana and Isla, are about 4-5 months old and they are very special pups.  They spent the first 3 months of their lives outside under their owners porch. Luckly, someone called animal control and they were seized. The siblings were taken to an over populated shelter and the shelter called us to help.  FHDR transported the pups to NJ to live in foster homes.  They are very happy to be in a foster home where they are getting healthy food & treats, soft beds and lots of love. Something they never experienced before.  The pups are very shy but so very sweet and they are learning to trust people. \n\nCordelia\u2019s foster mom says she is shy and very sweet.  She is doing well in their home and getting to know everyone. Cordelia will now come up to them on her own and she will take food from their hands. She isn\u2019t a cuddler but she will lick their hands and rolls over for tummy rubs.  She lives for tummy rubs!! She is so cute!  Her favorite special treat is scrambled eggs and cheese!  LOL! Cordelia enjoys being outside and she loves the snow!!  She is a playful puppy who enjoys playing with their dog and playing with toys and balls. She will toss her toys up in the air and run after them! Cordelia is so funny when she runs\u2026.she gallops! Cordelia sleeps through the night without having accidents and she is doing great with house training.  She has a beautiful brown coat with such pretty hazel eyes! Simply adorable!\n\nCordelia needs a home that has the patience to make her feel comfortabale and that can spend time teaching her that she is safe. (No children under 15 years old) We are sure if you adopt her, she will be a devoted, loving companion.  She just need the right person to call their own.  When you met her she will melt your heart!\n\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

            "description": "\nBeautiful, big boy Atlas is just over 1yrs old and currently weighs 95lbs.  He is a skinny boy and needs to fill out so we expect him to exceed 100lbs when fully grown.  He is a very friendly, social boy that will be a wonderful family dog.  He loves long walks, hiking trips and playing in the yard so an active family is required.  He is a typical shepherd so can be somewhat protective of his family when other dogs visit in the home so he must be the only dog.  When outdoors and away from his home, he does love to play with other large dogs.  He has great house manners and has some basic obedience but additional training will help him continue to be a well balanced pup.  Because he is such a large boy, kids must be over 14yrs old and he MUST have a large breed, German Shepherd experienced home.  He must also have a 6ft securely fenced yard... the bigger the better! If you are interested in meeting Atlas please email info@k9rr.org and include your phone number.",

            "description": "This is Lana!\n\nLana and her sisters, Cordelia and Isla, are about 4-5 months old and they are very special pups.  They spent the first 3 months of their lives outside under their owners porch. Luckly, someone called animal control and they were seized. The siblings were taken to an over populated shelter and the shelter called us to help.  FHDR transported the pups to NJ to live in foster homes.  They are very happy to be in a foster home where they are getting healthy food & treats, soft beds and lots of love. Something they never experienced before.  The pups are very shy but so very sweet and they are learning to trust people. \n\nThis is what Lana's foster mom says\u2026.\u201dLana is shy but warmed up to us quickly. She loves playing with our dog and she will lay right next to him. Playing with toys is fun for her and she will carry them around.  Lana likes to be with her people, she even sleeps in bed with us.  When you aren\u2019t giving her attention, she will let you know with a soft whine.  This pup is a big time puppy kisser! \n\nLana needs a home that has the patience to make her feel comfortabale and that can spend time teaching her that she is safe.  We are sure if you adopt her, she will be a devoted, loving companion.  She just needs the right person to call their own.  When you meet Lana, you will fall in love with her!\n\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

House-trained.\nHW-\n\nPhoenix showed up at the rural home of a Good Samaritan, who took pity on this sweet girl! She had wounds that covered her legs, shoulders and underbody. The Good Samaritan took her to the veterinarian, where she was vaccinated and given medication for infection of her wounds. After a professional assessment, it is believed that Phoenix was the victim of a horrible dog attack or possibly used as bait dog. The scarring on her legs and belly is consistent with a scenario where she was attempting to submit, but was attacked unmercifully anyway. Phoenix is an amazing girl, because she is so loving in spite of her past and wants only to please her humans. She loves interacting with people. Phoenix has truly risen from her ashes and is looking for a forever home where she will be loved for who she is, with or without the scars.\nPlease note: We only accept adoption applications through our website or in person (Facebook and Petfinder inquiries are not considered applications).",

I was found as a stray by some doggy catcher and they brought me to a dark and scary shelter. They said I was not friendly and couldn't walk. Thankfully that didn't stop Houston Animal Rescue Team from saving me.\n\nAs it turns out, I was abused by humans and both my back legs have sever injuries. Surgery is possible but will cause more bad than good. So, with lots of love and care, I started to walk and to open up. I am now one of the sweetest pup out there. I love to give kisses and cuddles. I walk funny, my face has a cute twist but I am one kind of a dog. I am potty trained and super friendly with other dogs.\n\nMy ideal family would have a yard and would be mellow and like to watch TV with me.\n\nTo meet me, please apply on https://www.hartrescue.com/adoption-foster-application-formTo meet me, please fill out an adoption application on https://www.hartrescue.com/adoption-process",

But in the hands of a loving YHT foster and a good vet, the unsavable leg was removed, infection resolved and she has now healed into a lively happy puppy who is unstoppable on three legs .  She lives with other dogs and a cat and her motto is \"girls just want to have fun\".  If you want to have some fun too, please contact us for a pre-adopt form that starts the process for meeting her.  We ask for a secure attached fenced yard and some \"at home\" time during the day to devote to her training and socializing.  Please email 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net to receive our pre-adopt form which starts the process so you can meet her.\n",

So enough about statistics, here's who I am -- a bright, energetic, friendly dog. I love to take walks. My specialty is taking squeekers and all the stuffing out of toys -- I do love that activity! If there is a strange noise in the yard, I like to let everyone know that Ollie Brown is on patrol! I love to chase balls or other thrown things -- not that I will return them to you, but I love to chase them. I am not a clingy lap dog, but I do enjoy sitting beside you while you read or watch TV. Do you think I could fit into your life? I'd love to hear from you!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

            "description": "Brodi is a 3-year-old Saint Bernard. He is 125 pounds of sheer love. Brodi loves to give full-body hugs and once you're in his arms, he likes to squeeze to let you know how much he loves you. True to the breed, he loves all people big and small. So why would this perfect love end up on rescue? Life sometimes has different plans than you expect and his family came upon hard times. So they asked Angels to help find a better situation for Brodi and his sister (Didi).\n\nBrodi'e perfect home will have a fenced yard. This big boy is just too big for an apartment, and have larger kids just because of his size. Brodi also has the classic case of \"I know my size and can use it to my advantage\"- as sweet as he is, he is also stubborn. Brodi does what Brodi wants. So his best family will continue to work with him and will understand if he doesn't want to get a bath, you just may not be able to give him one or get really creative. He would do well with a fenced yard, although not extremely active, he does need to stretch those long legs! As with any giant breed, any new family will also have to understand having a dog of this size, everything costs double (prevents, medical care ).\n\nSince Brodi is still new to his foster family, they will be doing some additional dog evaluations (so far so good). For example, leash evaluations and just spending time with him, getting to know him better to best understand his best future home. Stay tuned for updates. We have found that a lot of dogs are intimated by his size, so we will need to evaluate each potential home with dogs based on how comfortable they are sharing it with the jolly green giant!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Nelly arrived at NCCR on 1/8/21, surrendered due to  separation anxiety.  Her family wasn't able to be home as much as Nelly needed them to be.  She had originally been adopted from NCCR in 2019 after being pulled from an overcrowded shelter. She is a spayed female, thought to be a Labrador Retriever mix, approximately 2 \u00bd - 3 years old. Nelly had cherry eye, which was repaired prior to her arrival. Nelly is very friendly toward people, including children, and most other dogs. She is house trained. Nelly could use some obedience training to improve her manners, as in her excitement to meet people, she does sometimes jumps up.  Nelly cannot be safely crated, as she panics and may hurt herself trying to escape the crate. She does not like to be alone  but that might possibly be helped by having a doggie companion to spend her alone time with.  She gets along great with dogs at the Rescue and loves their playtime together.  We believe the right family for her will have another dog, not be gone long hours and have the patience to work with her anxieties.  She's really a very sweet and lovable girl who will flourish in the right situation.  \n\nNelly is spayed, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nNelly is sponsored by Robert Tipton, Sandra Pavlock, Jill Reese, Elaine Tschari and Ron and Brenda Johnson, Lucinda Gelsmino, Randy and Debby Ruhland and Will and Cindy Hepfer in memory of Skye and Rosa McDonald. Thank you everyone!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

I'm a body positive influencer waiting to find my forever home. Not to toot my own horn, but everyone that meets me says I'm very beautiful. My hobbies include: playing with stuffed animals, getting belly rubs and sleeping in. I love playing with toys and can occupy myself for quite a bit of time. I'm ok with other dogs, but would prefer that they leave me alone to play with my toys by myself. My foster fur siblings keep calling me an attention hog, whatever that means. I also like going for walks, will you take me? I can pull a bit, but foster mom says that I get into the rhythm eventually. I am on the larger side, and do require my people to be confident in their ability to handle me at times.\n\nMy new year's resolution is to eat healthier and to get more exercise. Is that your resolution too? Maybe we can work on it together?\n\nMaggie's foster mom here: Maggie is sweet, playful and most of all loving. Maggie is very attached to her people and will follow you wherever you go. Maggie knows basic obedience and is potty trained. Maggie is so sweet; she is sure to win you over. Her striking good looks help too. It has been so easy having her in our home, she is very settled and adapted easily to our routine. Seriously though, how can you resist her underbite?! Does she sound like the girl for you? Apply today!\n\nBit.ly/WHBRadopt\n\nwww.Wigglinhomeboxerrescue.org\nEmail: wigglinhomeboxerrescue@gmail.com\nPhone (360) 723-0219",

She came to us after living her first six months of life outside during the day and in an outdoor shed at night.\n\nShe is currently living in foster care with other dogs and kids and she is super affectionate and playful. She's learning potty training and crate training for the first time now.\n\nDespite her innocent looks, this little girl has discovered that she can dig under the fence to get to the neighbors chickens... So a fenced in yard is definitely required for her and she should not be left alone unattended outside because she is a digger!\n\nAlthough she has not been around cats with us, she previously lived with them around and we don't see her being aggressive to one. \n\nLeta is now spayed and fully vetted and chipped. Her adoption fee is $400. \n\nTo apply to adopt Leta please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

She has ignored cats but does take a very intense interest in squirrels. \n\nPlease call or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more info on how to meet Lady.

            "description": "Here is what my foster mom has to say about me: Two year old Taz (also known as Razzmataz, we have already nicknamed her) was hit by a car in November 2019 and surrendered to Pacc shortly after. Her right hind leg was amputated and is fully healed from her injuries and adapted to the tripod life- she gets around like she has 6 legs! Her positive energy and happy-go-lucky personality shine brighter than the Tucson summer sun. The words cuddle bug, teddy bear, snuggle bunny, sweetie pie, can't describe just how incredibly sweet she is. I have fostered many dogs over the years and she is truly special and one of a kind. Taz is potty trained- not one accident since she's been with us! She loves to play with other dogs, however can be pushy during play, therefore an equally playful dog is recommended. She would thrive as an only dog in the home, which I believe to be best. Not sure if she would be ok around cats, but she is calm around my chickens. Taz loves and craves human attention. She doesn't show signs of separation anxiety at this point. Does ok in a kennel, but we haven't had a need to use it much. She loves walks. She gets so excited that she has a tendency to pull. Having only 3 legs doesn't slow this girl down, so she'll need a little leash training. Taz responds to her name and comes when called. She knows sit and we are working on down. Her eye contact is on point and she is eager to please. She likes toys and fetch and plays very gentle with people, young and old. She takes treats so gentle it's as if she doesn't have teeth! She is respectful of boundries like the kitchen table, couch, bed, however we enjoy her loving company so she is allowed to join us in these areas. Car rides are a treat and she does well during the short drives we've taken so far. She is the perfect mix of playful and chill. I think she would make a wonderful therapy dog and is a perfect family dog- a diamond in the rough.",

            "description": "As is the case for most everyone, 2020 was a bit rough on Iroh. This big, beautiful boy came to PACC in a pretty neglected state, needing major surgery and a lot of TLC. He went through a lot both before coming to PACC, and while recovering from surgeries in the shelter environment. Despite everything he's been through, Iroh has kept a positive attitude- everyone who's met him says he's the sweetest, friendliest boy ever! Iroh recently returned from a stay in his foster home- here is what his foster had to say about this big teddy bear: - Iroh is very easy to walk and well behaved in the home. - He is housebroken - He slept in the living room on a dog bed and doesn't tend to jump up on furniture. - He enjoys chewing on rawhide bones and likes ropes for tug of war. - He is very cuddly, friendly, and definitely a couch potato who snoozes the day away. - He LOVES belly rubs and enjoys rides in the car (he needs a little boost to get in). - He dislikes stairs and would likely do best in a single level home. Iroh is an affectionate, easygoing, sweetheart of a guy who is a definite shelter favorite. He would likely do best as an only pet, but he's so loving that he'll be enough! Ask to meet him today!",

She is more mobile but still needs assistance with getting around. Here is what her foster mom had to say about her: Ponyo is very affectionate and loves to cuddle! She loves to play but has very limited mobility so tends to spend most of her time chewing on toys but be careful, she likes anything with fringe and will occasionally steal a shoe or two! Her activities are limited by her condition, but she is as active as a dog like her can be. She has a silly expression, her eyes are very tender and she is full of love. She is the perfect mix of Goofy, playful, loving, and clumsy! She gets so excited to see her humans that she wiggles her butt in a very funny fashion. Because she's a medical needs dog, she will need someone who is willing to offer yoga mats, traction to aid in her walking, willing to work on physical therapy and give her lots of love. A home without cats would be preferable and one that can slowly introduce her to other dogs as well! She is perfect for someone who is nurturing and enjoys taking care of others. She is not an independent dog and needs her person to be okay with that. If Ponyo is tugging on your heartstrings, make an appointment to meet her today.",

The shelter environment has been very overwhelming for this quiet guy, so he spent some time getting special attention in PACC's decompression program for shy and fearful dogs. Doc is learning that people coming to visit him is a good thing, since he gets to go outside to the park, and he gets lots of snacks. His favorite is cheese, please! Doc has made major improvements since being at PACC, but needs a foster or adopter who will continue to work with him on socialization and gaining confidence. Doc has shared his kennel nicely with other dogs while at PACC, so would likely do just fine in a home with other pets. Ask about Doc today- it's a prescription for happiness!!",

Butch came to PACC as a stray in need of medical attention for some pretty serious wounds, but after spending some time in the clinic, he's on the mend and ready to get out of the shelter and into a home. Because of his wounds, Butch hasn't been to play group with other pups yet, but during his behavioral evaluation he was easy to leash up and walked nicely. He's friendly with handlers and staffers tell us he's a happy and easygoing boy. Butch doesn't react to other dogs in the kennel and is a really laid back guy. Volunteers say he enjoys pets, scratches and treats (who doesn't) and is a very sweet boy. If Butch has already won your heart, don't waste any more time and make an appointment to meet him today.",

After spending some time in our clinic, her glucose levels are now under control and she's ready to find her forever home. Sasha's former owners said that she lived with other dogs and has experience with young children. Since coming to PACC, she's been sweet with volunteers and staffers, but a little bit unsure about the other dogs (the kennel can be a bit overwhelming.) While she can be a little nervous, Sasha is definitely friendly and does well with calm dogs and a little bit of time to warm up and get comfortable. Sasha was mostly an outdoor dog in her former home, but given her great manners, we know she'd make a great in-home companion. Sasha has spent some time in a foster home, and her foster said the following: -\tShe loves to play ball and will give the ball back -\tShe likes to chew on cow hooves and antlers -\tShe walks well on a leash -\tShe cuddles -\tShe is house and crate trained",

            "description": "WORDS FROM KARMA'S FOSTER MOM :) The worlds biggest brightest smile belongs to... Little Miss Karma!!!!! But this is not the happy Karma I have always known. Karma found her self at the shelter sometime ago. She did so poorly there she had stopped eating and was walking in circles in her kennel. Before that she had been a yard dog, so shelter life was a really tough adjustment. She was completely shutting down, like she had given up all hope. She needed out desperately! In a home she changed quickly and dramatically. She became this silly,happy,smiling girl. And then she found herself a new home. But unfortunately, this home was not to last. Her person had to give her up for health reasons. I just couldn't let her go back to the shelter, so once again she has come back with me to look for her forever home. At four years old (OK -pushing 5) you would think Karma would be starting to slow down, but that is hardly the case. She is such a super happy, high energy, playful little wiggle butt. She just loves chasing a ball and playing tuggies, but her favorite thing is water. It can be a sprinkler, a hose or the pool. But she's not keen on taking any high dives off the end of my big pool. She much prefers her kiddie pool! When she does blossom, she can be a little bit of a diva. Karma is just starting to be a snuggle bug and she lets you know how happy she is with her full body wags and little bop kisses. She wants to be with you all the time and would probably be happiest as your one and only. Though Karma has had quite some troubles and disappointments in her life, you can tell by the smile on her face that she is an optimist. Both she and I are both determined to find her perfect home. Bonus- she is cat tested and approved! To learn more about Karma please email her foster mom Robin at rldaniels18@gmail.com or pacc.foster@pima.gov.",

At 7 years old, she's past all the puppy shenanigans and spends her days relaxing and napping. Looking for a calm friend to binge the latest Netflix true crime documentaries with? Look no further! Chiquita enjoys heading outdoors for a stroll through the park, taking her time to stop and smell the roses. A speed demon she is not! When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Chiquita was easygoing and tolerant of other calm dogs, and asked for her space from the rowdier pups. She generally kept to herself and preferred to hang out with the people in the yard. Chiquita would like to meet any resident dogs before heading home to make sure it's a good fit. Ask about this mellow lady today!",

Words from her Foster family! : Poppie is house trained, enjoys waks, she lets me put the harness and leash on her and does wheelies and spins around in excitement. It's really cute! She is pretty good on the leash, she stops to sniff, like normal dogs. She keeps up with my other dog. We have not had a need to use a crate. She has not gone potty inside, she uses the dog door if she needs to. She doesn't chew anything up. She seems to know come and stays by me when I want her to. She is great with the kids that meet her on walks, but she is not currently living with cats or kids. Every day she gets more affectionate as she gets more comfortable living with us. She rolls on her back when I walk by sometimes for pets, she will lay by me for pets as long as I pet her when I'm on the couch, when I'm doing yoga she tries to get involved and walks under me to be involved. She really wants someone to sit with her and cuddle all day and take her for walks! Poppie is a calm, gentle companion who walks well on leash. Ask about adopting or fostering a senior pet today!",

            "description": "Dino-mite!! Dino is a handsome boy with the most beautiful markings and a perfect round spot on his back. Dino is a nice boy with a fairly calm demeanor who enjoys treats and is very polite and gentle when taking them. FOSTER Q and A: Housetrained? Yes. Details on training: He pulls a little. He's great in his crate. He is super calm when he is in it and we cover it. He seems to like going there to relax for short periods of time. He's really good at sitting and gentle taking treats. He likes to chew on flavored bones. He walks around the dinner table for a minute when we are eating dinner but once he is ignored' he just goes back to his bed. Describe cuddling behavior/affection level: He absolutely loves to cuddle and loves to give kisses. We can put a pillow on his butt and lay there with him. He doesn't mind. Describe play behavior and favorite toys: He likes playing alone or with a person. He likes a squeaky duck. Describe activity level: Medium Look into the dog's eyes. What is he/she telling you?

            "description": "We know from experience that blind dogs not only survive, they thrive! Meet sweet Seline. She's back at the shelter now, but she spent time in a foster home and here is what they had to say about her: Seline is truly one of the sweetest and well behaved dogs that I have been around, and she is such a character! She is blind but since we have had her since April, she has learned to navigate around the house and backyard (but definitely still bumps into things but she handles it like a champ! Lol). She is diabetic and requires insulin twice a day, but it is so easy to do and she sits like a perfect angel when we're giving it to her. She has been around cats at her last foster and I believe did well with them. She has been living with my dog who is a smaller Beagle/Dachshund mix and they get along and will play occasionally. I did introduce her to my mom and sisters dogs, both males, one is a pitbull and one a German Shepherd - and she seemed a little nervous around them, so maybe a house with smaller dogs or no other dogs would be best for her. We do not have her in a crate ever, and she is great in the house and has never destroyed anything other than her toys. She gets on the furniture only when invited on, but absolutely loves her orthopedic bed I, and will lounge on it and chew on her toys all day long. She does prefer to be in the same room as you when you are home. She also loves to go on short walks, but is strong on the leash. I have also learned that she loves to play in the water! When Seline met others dogs at PACC she was social, appropriate and tolerant. She explored the play yard on her own but was also interested in the other dogs. She also enjoyed playing in the water! Plase ask about fostering ro adopting this very deserving dog!!",

She is trusting with humans and has so much love to give. She is an incredible dog. 8.\tWhat are your favorite things about him or her? Cute behaviors? Sufi has the cutest snore and she has the funniest lean - sometimes she'll lean back to try to lay closer to you and just falls right over. It's so funny and adorable! 9.\tWhat is/are your favorite physical characteristic(s) of this of this animal? She has absolutely beautiful eyes and coloring - and her EARS are SO SOFT. 10.\tWhat would the ideal home look like for him/her? Sufi would probably love a home where she can have lots of people to love her and shower her with affection! We guess that she would thrive with kids or a family, and she probably wouldn't mind being the center of attention as a solo dog or with a resident cat. 11.\tAnything else that would make this animal stand out to an adopter? We cannot stress how sweet this girl is with people - everyone that meets her falls in love with her gentle personality. Medical/Behavior Issue 1.\tAny medical issues? Sufi is going through the process of getting a brace for her back leg with A Loyal Companion! She has been fitted and shoud receive the brace at the end of January. This will help her with a calcified joint/previous injury on her right back leg. She is currently on CycloSPORINE. She gets around well despite her joint and leg issues and is overall a very happy gal. 2.\tAny behavior issues? Sufi is picky about her dog friends and must have a meeting at PACC if there is another dog in the home. Her notes also included a mention of resource guarding, though we haven't experienced this ourselves first-hand.",

He is quite the dog!\n\nSirus is about 1 year old and weighs about 40 pounds. He had a home but sadly his owners surrendered him to a over populated shelter in NC because they could no longer care for him.  Sirus is now living in NJ in a nice foster home and he is having fun! Sirus\u2019s foster family says\u2026..\u201dSirus is very friendly with everyone and he is good with other dogs.  Sirus likes to play with toys, walk on a leash and run in the yard.  Sirus has a lot of energy but he also will just chill out when we can\u2019t play with him.  When you talk to Sirus he will do head tilts.  He is so darn cute! Sirus is just an awesome dog!\u201d\n\nAnyone looking for a happy, active dog, come meet Sirus!If you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

            "description": "This is Simon!\n\nSimon is about 3 years old and weighs about 45-47 pounds.  As you an see Simon is very handsome with beautiful coloring.  What you can\u2019t see is his sweet personality.  Simon\u2019s foster family said he is an all around good pup.  Simon enjoys being with people and other dogs. He has a very sweet temperament and true to his breed he enjoys running in large open grass areas.  Simon can be timid at first, but warms up quickly when you give him a treat and a pet.  He doesn\u2019t like playing with toys at all but he will carry a ball in his mouth.  Simon wants to be with people. And in the morning Sinon will run around the house looking for everyone so he knows where they are!  He is a big time cuddler (he will sleep on the sofa or bed with us) and he loves belly rubs.  Simon does this cute thing where he will come up to you and put his head on your lap. He is so cute!  \n\nSImon had a family in NC and when they could no longer care for him, they surrendered him to an over populated shelter.  When FHDR found out about this special dog we transported Simon to NJ to live in a foster home.  \n\nSimon wins everyone\u2019s heart within 5 minutes!\n\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

            "description": "Lulu is a sweet and calm love bug. She can be shy at first, but her wagging tail gives her away almost instantly! She is a one-year-old, 62 pound, black and white boxer mix, looking for a new home! Could it be with you?\n\nHer favorite place to be is sitting right beside you, with her head on your chest or in your lap. She does fantastic when riding in a car and sits like a little human! She is crate trained AND potty trained! She also knows the command \u201csit\u201d. Way to go, Lulu!\n\nShe walks on leash surprisingly gently for her size, but a confident handler would be a great plus for her to become even better and reliable on leashed walks.\n\nShe is great with people and kids. Lulu LOVES men!!! However, she will show reactive behaviors around other dominant dogs, so she will do best in a home with a very submissive dog or as the only dog in the home! If you do choose her as your one and only, she\u2019ll never stop saying thank you with butt wiggles & sweet kisses and will make you a wonderful companion!\n\nLulu is very calm. She does not jump up unless invited, and maintains cool and collected when new people enter her space. She settles down nicely and can enjoy a long nap with the best of them! If you are looking for a couch potato, love bug, she might be the gal for you!\n\nIf Lulu attended Hogwarts, we believe she would be a Hufflepuff. She has kind eyes, loyalty to her people, and has a tenacious spirit that we think her future forever home will admire most of all!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lulu please go to our website to get the approval process started by completing our online pre-adoption application http://www.southernskiesrescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "\nMeet Pepper!\n\nPepper is an absolute sweetheart!  She is about 4 years old and weights about 35-36 pounds.  Pepper was found as a stray in NC and   was taken to an over populated shelter. She was adopted there, but unfortunately she was surrendered back because of the owner's allergies.  Poor Pepper was back in the shelter.  \n\nFHDR transported Pepper to NJ to live in a foster home and she is now waiting for a furever home.  The one word to describe Pepper is loving.  Pepper\u2019s foster family says\u2026\u2026Pepper is a happy, energetic, sweet dog who gets along with everyone!  She spends her days going for walks, playing with toys (squeaky) and hanging out with the family.  We find her toys and treats in the corners of the room or under the sofa because she likes hiding them!  Pepper is very easy going and playful.  She listens very well and knows the commands sit, no, lay down.  Pepper is on her way to being house trained. She loves laying down for belly rubs and she likes giving kisses. This sweet dog  gets along well with other dogs. Pepper has a faboulous temperment!\"\n\nPepper can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

            "description": "Max is such a cuddly guy. He wants to be with his people! He has such a sad story to share, but he's living in the moment and is a great pet! Max came into rescue after his person passed away from cancer. He was an animal lover and when he passed there were seven living together - Prince, Lady, Daisy, Bo, Roscoe, Brutus, and Max. They are not bonded to one another but enjoy the company of other pets and so far, all have tested great with cats, (respectful) kids, and all adults. They appear housetrained, crate trained or crate tolerant, and enjoy some snuggles on or near your lap! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application becasue a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair to our foster and the pet so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption! The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

            "description": "Meet Siri! She is an about 2.5 years old, 88 pound ridgeback/plott hound mix. She came to us as a puppy with mange (she has a few tiny scars but is BEAUTIFUL and fully healed years ago) and was adopted but through no fault of her own is back with Maxx & Me looking for a forever home. She is a very smart girl who knows basic commands, loves to be cuddled, and play with her toys. She is potty trained and behaves nicely in the house. She pulls a little on leash but is easy to redirect and just needs a little work. Siri needs a 6' fenced in yard to play in. She has medium energy so would be great to go for walks or adventures then just chill next to her people. She loves everyone she meets!! She is good with other dogs but fine as an only. No small animals or small kids because she doesn't seem to understand that she is quite a big girl and really wanted to play with a chihuahua she met so we don't want anyone to accidentally get hurt. Siri spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption applications can be found on www.maxxandme.org. Adoption donation is only $250!\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue. 1/29/21 11:55 AM",

In the familys home that found him he slept and ate with another dog, met her 3 year old niece and was such a good boy.  He's played well with nearly every dog that he's met here since we have gotten him, he is unneutered still and has only shown a dislike for another unneutered male.  \n\nBogie loves to run in the fields, he has a lot of energy to burn off!  He is a bit of an escape artist though and has escaped 2 crates while here so now he gets to relax and sleep in one of our suites.  Bogie loves to be around people and isn't keen on being alone still, would do best with someone who is home frequently (at least in the beginning) until he gets used to his new routine.  Bogie will be ready to go home and will be fully vaccinated and neutered by mid February, but he is ready to meet his forever family today!",

I am 2 years old and about 42lbs Shepard Mix. \nOriginally from Vermillion Parish and confiscated from a cruelty case, but me and some friends hitched a ride back to New Orleans with my foster mom. I vaguely remember my past life because I have been getting so much love at my foster home where I have made some friends. \nI must say that I love everyone and every dog. I\u2019m very charming and no dog can resist me. I can\u2019t help it! My wish list includes: an active home with other dogs preferably. I don\u2019t really dig cats, but kids are my jam. \nIf you enjoy running, well I would love to run with you! If you enjoy throwing balls for me to catch we will get along so great. \nI am being treated for heart-worm and already scheduled to get neutered on 1/28/2021. \nI am really looking for my forever home, and I\u2019ll tell you a secret I like wearing costumes. When it\u2019s cold I won\u2019t mind wearing sweaters. \nSo now just go fill out an adoption application so we can meet soon. \nI must warn though my foster mom says you will fall in love with me on the spot. So be prepared!\u201d\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

ORANGE\u2013 Dogs in the ORANGE category are commonly timid and will need some confidence building at first. Once dogs in the ORANGE category are comfortable, they will most likely be energetic and needing similar guidance to dogs that are in the YELLOW category. Dogs in the ORANGE category sometimes benefit from another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

She needs a family who will be extra patient with her, and who preferably has previous experience with dogs. The NMDR Behavior Manager will talk to prospective adopters to explain the work we've done with her, and what will be the best home situation for her. To submit an application to adopt Phyllis, visit https://nmdr.org/our-dogs/adopt/\n\nPrior to being rescued, many of our dogs have experienced minimal socialization. As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt dogs to homes with young children. Homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

I love to run and play and would do best with resident fur-friend. My foster family says I am getting better at learning how to play with toys, and I am learning my manners. I have also improved with my treat guarding. I currently live with cats, and 2 have become my friend. I am definitely interested in the other 2, however they are not interested in me. I let my foster family know when I hear a strange sound, or if someone is at the door. I am such a happy and loving boy and would love to find my forever home. I have become best friends with my foster sister and would love to have play dates with her.\"  Rico is a mix, long bodied & short legged. He weighs 25lbs at a year old. He is all puppy, very sweet and energetic. Must come to Baltimore to meet/adopt Rico.  Adoption fee is $275.  Want to know more about Rico? Email DRNA representative at klpndml@comcast.net.

            "description": "Netherwood is a 1-2 yr old Pit bull mix. She is loose, wiggly and happy! Netherwood is high energy which means she would need plenty of exercise and playtime. She pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. She is food motivated. Netherwood knows the sit command. She is NOT a fan of cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642 I AM SPONSORED!

They are 5 yrs. old (est. birth date 10/7/2015) and since they have spent their entire lives together, Furkids is committed to keeping them together in one home. Briana P weighs 12.75 lbs. and Blake P weighs 13.5 lbs., so they won't take up much space in a home, but they'll fill the home with a lot of love. The combined adoption fee for both is $800. If you want more information about these siblings, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

They are 5 yrs. old (est. birth date 10/7/2015) and since they have spent their entire lives together, Furkids is committed to keeping them together in one home. Briana P weighs 12.75 lbs. and Blake P weighs 13.5 lbs., so they won't take up much space in a home, but they'll fill the home with a lot of love. The combined adoption fee for both is $800. If you want more information about these siblings, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

He gets along with other dogs, a calmer dog would be best but Archie also seems to be content with some toys and his people. He is housebroken and crate trained but still needs coaxing to go in. He will require a fenced yard as he is still not comfortable walking on a leash. If you have a quiet home, patience, and a lot of love Archie is your man.",

FHDR rescued the siblings and we  transported them to NJ to live in foster homes.  The pups are about 5-6 months old, about 25-27 pounds and they are very friendly. Paul'ss foster family says\u2026..\u201dPaul is the best dog ever!  He is joyful, cute, energetic and loyal.  Paul just loves people! This cuddle bug loves hanging out with us and will follow us everywhere. He loves to lay next to or on top of us. LOL!  Paul does this cute thing where he will wrap his paws around our neck when he is sitting on our lap. And, he will also cock his head when you are training him. He is so very cute!  Paul already knows the comands \u201c sit\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, comes when he is called and he is 90% house trained.  He enjoys playing with toys (bones, balls, rope toy and his squeaky duck) and playing with our dog. They run around jumping on each other and play bow.\u201d\n\n\nPaul will bring smiles to your home!\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

George\u2019s foster says\u2026.\u201dGeorge is very sweet and he loves people! He likes to play with toys, play with my dog and go for walks. I think he would love being in a home with another dog. On his walks, George enjoys meeting new people! He is energetic, yet one of his favorite things to do is cuddle! This pup is very happy hanging out with the family while lounging in his doggie bed. And he loves belly rubs! George knows the comands sit, no wait, okay\u201d.\n\nGeorge is looking for a family to share his life with!

            "description": "\nJohn is one of the Beatle Pups!\n\nJohn and his siblings were dropped off at an over crowded shelter in TN.  FHDR rescued the siblings and we  transported them to NJ to live in foster homes.  The pups are about 5-6 months old and they are very friendly. John\u2019s foster family says\u2026..\u201dJohn is a sweetheart!  This cuddle bug loves hanging out with us and will follow us everywhere. He loves to drape himself across my lap just to be close to me.  John is an energetic, easy going puppy who joys playing with toys (snuggle bear and chew toys) and playing other dogs. He totally loses it when he sees himself in the mirror (see video)!  It\u2019s so funny!  John is well behaved and wants to please.  He already knows the commands..sit, down, no, potty.  He has so much energy it\u2019s joyful to see his enthusiam and grace!\"\n\nJohn will bring smiles to your home!\n\nIf you have a furever home for this pet, please e-mail Furever Home Dog Rescue at FureverHomeDogRescue@gmail.com and request an adoption application. \n\nThe breed and age of this pet is listed as is our best guess.  We have no background info on who the mom and dad are.\n\nPlease note we do not adopt puppies/dogs to homes where they will be left alone all day. \n\nWe do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.\n\nPlease read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!",

            "description": "Bo is a fine fellow! He has such a sad story to share, but he's living in the moment and is a great pet! Bo came into rescue after his person passed away from cancer. He was an animal lover and when he passed there were seven living together - Prince, Lady, Daisy, Bo, Roscoe, Brutus, and Max. They are not bonded to one another but enjoy the company of other pets and so far, all have tested great with cats, (respectful) kids, and all adults. They appear housetrained, crate trained or crate tolerant, and enjoy some snuggles on or near your lap! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application becasue a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair to our foster and the pet so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption! The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

Wendi came into ODAAT completely feral. She is still fearful and cautious with people, cars, and noises. But she is looking for a home of her own! Her ideal foster/adopter would be someone that is home most of the time. She needs someone that is willing to spend quality time with her. She needs patience, structure, boundaries, and most of all- human interaction. A home that understands she will need time to build trust with them is also important. Once she does she will be committed through and through. Leashed walks, even in a fenced yard for a while, will be a must! Wendi is a sweet girl that will make a great addition to a family!

A Good Dog Rescue took me in and got me my shots and neuter and I will now live, and come to NY this week in search of a real family and a real commitment.  \nI\u2019m 40lbs and 3 years young.

Koda loves to snuggle with his people especially at night he loves to be near you in bed.\nKoda is house and doggie-door trained, but will use a pee-pad if offered & needed. He loves everyone he meets especially other dogs, but plays roughly and is learning how to play calmly. He also doesn't mind cats but need a lot of 'entertainment\" so he doesn't get into mischief. \nKoda still has a lot of puppy energy & will jump on people to greet them, so he'll do best with kids 8 years & older. Also, he'd love to have at least one or more playful K9 siblings.\n\nKoda is fully vetted, microchipped, current on all shots and flea and tick prevention. His adoption fee is $200.\n\n To adopt, please fill out the attached application.\nhttps://form.jotform.com/202415148836051",

            "description": "Meet Bear! This 8 month old Boxer mix is all legs with the wiggliest butt we've ever seen! He loves getting attention from people and practically bends in half when he wags his tail. Give him some good pets, and Bear will lean into you in total happiness. This young pup needs a little training up, but he knows how to sit politely for a treat and is eager to learn more manners. Bear would be great in a family with kids or other dogs - he's playful, likes to wrestle, and really loves chasing and kicking balls - he's a soccer star in the making! Let us know if you're to meet sweet, lovable Bear!\n\n-----\nIMPORTANT: To protect the health of our staff and volunteers, ARF is currently conducting adoptions by appointment only.

Someone to snuggle on the couch with? Poppy is your girl!\n\n\n\nPoppy is a well-rounded girl of 7 years. Her hobbies include walks, pets, begging for snacks, and napping. Her signature move is to walk up to you, sit on your feet, and look up at you over her head with big puppy dog eyes, begging for a little love. She is a sweet girl who can get excited and chase you around the living room. She'll crawl right up into your lap and let you hold her like a little baby (she doesn't realize she is 80lbs). Though she's not interested in toys, she is interested in you goofing around the family room floor. But if you're looking for some quiet time, she quickly gets the picture and will join you in that nap. When she sleeps, she is an active dreamer. You'll catch her chasing after squirrels or whimpering at the moon in her sleep. She might wake you up with her chasing paws if you're sharing a bed!\n\n\n\nInitially she is interested in your tasty human food, but quickly realizes it is not for her and will go lay down while her humans eat. Poppy is a quick learner. She just wants to follow her humans around the house helping with whatever she can. Whether you're vacuuming, cooking, attempting yoga, or watching TV, Poppy is by your side (or in your downward dog) lending her support! She is the perfect example of a dog's unconditional love.",

He is house trained, neutered, and up to date on his shots.\nWe think he would do best as the only pet in the house.\nBecause of corvid 19, Please call the shelter for a appointment. Adoption fee is $200.00.",

            "description": "JAIME: 15 week old, 26lbs (as of 1/10), Lab/Hound Mix, Neutered Male (Estimated to be about 50lbs Full Grown), HIGH ACTIVE\n\nHe's got a ways to go physically and emotionally before he grows into those dinner plate sized feet. Jaime is a little timid and cant imagine hell be big and strong one day soon. Hes quickly set atremble by noises on the street, hes intimidated by the city and a wallflower around new people. Behind closed doors where hes comfy though, this 4-month-old lab/hound mix melts into a cuddle puddle. Boosting his confidence and minimizing the stress triggers will be key to helping him grow into a well adjusted young buck, so hell need to join a family with primary pup ownership experience out of the city or in a suuuuuuuuper quiet area. Jaime is smart, playful, and good with other dogs, but hell need some guidance on trusting the world around him. A little pro training could help. Hes around 24 lbs now and will likely hit 50 to 60 lbs, possibly more, when hes done growing. Hard to say. Hes got a big brain and lots of energy to burn, so tons of exercise and games (90 minutes a day plus) will be crucial. Intrested in adopting? Please go to www.socialteesnyc.org \n\nHis Foster Says: Jaime has so much love to give but isn't confident enough to show it just yet. What he does live for are soft cuddles and loving head rubs, specifically right behind his ear - that's the sweet spot! He feels most comfortable cuddled up on his dog bed or his favorite place, the couch! Head propped up on a pillow is where he likes to take his naps. Even though Jaime has a lot of energy, he isn't a city boy just yet so short walks is what he feels the most comfortable with, so he really likes to play at home with his favorite tennis ball, lamby, or bone. Overall, Jaime is also one of the smartest (and cutest) puppies I have ever met, and has already mastered going up and down flights of stairs! \n\nPlease welcome JAIME and his siblings to NYC. These puppies are our latest litter of working breed heartbreakers. You might look at thier faces and be like OMG I need that ASAP. But due to thier breed mix these babies need a very particular home. They need a home with primary dog experience (meaning that you have owned or been solely responsible for a dog as an adult). Growing up with dogs is very different to being fully responsible for a dog as an adult (sorry to burst your bubbles/dreams so early in the year). These guys are very fast learners which means they need adopters who are going to be up to the task of keeping thier little brains active and stimulated so that they don't become bored trouble markers. As full grown adults you can expect these babies to need a minimum of 90 minutes of outdoor exercise. Hound mixes are notorious for wanting to walk for days. Walking is thier love language. They are working on potty training skills and basic commands. They are good with other dogs and cats. They are not a good match for families with young kids as these guys are going to be going through teething. JAIME did come down with a cold when he first arrived in NYC but he is doing great: saw the vet, went on antibiotics and his appetite and energy level hasn't been affected :) Interested in adopting please go to www.socialteesnyc.org \n \n\nWhat is a hound?: Hounds were originally bred as the first hunting companions. They are known for their ability to track by scent and are a high energy kind of pup that need to practice using their nose. We can't think of a breed more excited to go for a walk than a hound. They love to be able to get out daily and have a good sniff. Hounds are known for being highly intelligent and fast runners.\n\n\\What does owning this dog entail?: Tons of socialization, exercise, and mental stimulation is crucial. This dog is considered a working breed since their original purpose was to do a job. It's going to be very important to keep this pup busy both physically and mentally -- that includes a minimum of 90 minutes of outdoor time every day for this high energy dog. A perfect walking, hiking, and running buddy. We strongly recommend a basic training course to get a more solid feel for this pup's individual needs and how to best communicate with each other. A well trained dog is a happy dog. Hounds are the best snugglers in our experience, and they are great dogs for active outdoorsy people. Heads up they tend to have high prey drive though, so adults are often quick to go for small animals like squirrels and not great choices for homes with cats or other small animals. They can also be very stop and go walking buddies sometimes because of that crazy nose of theirs, so some hounds require extra leash training -- they literally want to stop and smell every little thing. They are also quick to take off if they catch a scent, so you have to be extra careful with hounds off leash because they will disappear if you haven't done enough recall training with them -- or even if you have sometimes, their instincts just take over. We strongly recommend not having them off leash in an unenclosed area.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org.

            "description": "JACY:15weeks old, 22lbs (As of 1/9), Lab/Hound Mix, Neutered Male, HIGH ACTIVE (Estimated to be about 50lbs Full Grown) NEEDS HOME IN SUBURBS\n\nPlease welcome JACYand his siblings to NYC. These puppies are our latest litter of working breed heartbreakers. You might look at thier faces and be like OMG I need that ASAP. But due to thier breed mix these babies need a very particular home. They need a home with primary dog experience (meaning that you have owned or been solely responsible for a dog as an adult). Growing up with dogs is very different to being fully responsible for a dog as an adult (sorry to burst your bubbles/dreams so early in the year). These guys are very fast learners which means they need adopters who are going to be up to the task of keeping thier little brains active and stimulated so that they don't become bored trouble markers. As full grown adults you can expect these babies to need a minimum of 90 minutes of outdoor exercise. Hound mixes are notorious for wanting to walk for days. Walking is thier love language. They are working on potty training skills and basic commands. They are good with other dogs and cats. They are not a good match for families with young kids as these guys are going to be going through teething. JACY would do best in a home OUTSIDEof the city. (think suburbs)And he would be thrilled to have a doggie sibling to learn from as he is on the shyer side.Interested in adopting please go to www.socialteesnyc.org\n\nHis Foster Dad Says: \"It takes Jacy a while to come out of his shell, hes still relaxing into the city and his personality is doubling every day. In the first three days he went from a skittish pup who wanted no attention to playing with toys and exploring the apartment. Going outside is still a lot for him though. He is absolutely obsessed with tennis balls and treats and is wicked smart. We dont have the puppy pad training perfected, but thats just an aiming issue. He figured out he was supposed to go on the pad the first day. Were also working on making him comfortable on a leash inside and learning basic things like sitting and waiting. New people need to go slow because he gets nervous. Whoever is the lucky person to adopt him may have to be really patient at first and let him open up, but when he does hes an incredibly sweet, playful, and goofy pup.\n\nHis Instagram Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CKPsphXASoI/\n\nWhat is a hound?:Hounds were originally bred asthe first hunting companions.They are known for their ability to track by scent and are a high energy kind of pup that need to practice using their nose. We can't think of a breed more excited to go for a walk than a hound. They love to be able to get out daily and have a good sniff. Hounds are known for being highly intelligent and fast runners.\n\n\\What does owning this dog entail?:Tons of socialization, exercise, and mental stimulation is crucial. This dog is considered a working breed since their original purpose was to do a job.It's going to be very importantto keep this pup busy both physically and mentally -- that includes a minimum of 90 minutes of outdoor time every day for this high energy dog. A perfect walking, hiking, and running buddy.We strongly recommend a basic training course to get a more solid feel for this pup's individual needs and how to best communicate with each other.A well trained dog is a happy dog.Hounds are the best snugglers in our experience, and they are great dogs for active outdoorsy people. Heads up they tend to have high prey drive though, so adults are often quick to go for small animals like squirrels and not great choices for homes with cats or other small animals. They can also be very stop and go walking buddies sometimes because of that crazy nose of theirs, so some hounds require extra leash training -- they literally want to stop and smell every little thing. They are also quick to take off if they catch a scent, so you have to be extra careful with hounds off leash because they will disappear if you haven't done enough recall training with them -- or even if you have sometimes, their instincts just take over. We strongly recommend not having them off leash in an unenclosed area\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org.Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best.

His family can no longer care for him so he is looking for a new loving family so he can continue his beautiful life journey! \nBatman is a wonderful young pup, who loves to play and human attention! He is dog friendly (including small dogs) and kid-friendly. He enjoys running around in a yard but also likes to be inside to curly up with his hooman. Only 10 months old, Batman is already a big boy at 62lbs! He is quite obedient, he knows sit and stay, like his current family says, \u201cI can leave the back door open and if I say.....sit batman....he sits. Then I say Stay! And he will stay right there with the door open.\u201d Batman is very loving and affectionate! He does not like to be left alone and does require more house training as he is still a puppy but he is fully potty trained. Batman will be the perfect addition to an active family with a yard, who can take him on daily walks and exercise. \nBatman has been neutered, microchipped and current on vaccines.

I was found on a highway and a really nice man stopped his car blocking traffic to save me. I am now in a foster home and I am loving life. I love my doggie and kitty brothers and sisters. I really love my crate and dog bed and can find me always lounging in there. I love food!! Don't let my tiny physique fool you, I will take down a Buffalo and eat it whole if i could. I love meal time and may whine a bit if you're not fast enough but i never bark!! I don't think foster mom has ever heard me bark.\n\nI am potty trained and love going outside to explore but i won't go far as I like being close to my human. I am allergic to fleas so I'll need monthly prevention to prevent me from breaking out and scratching myself raw. I am a lover not a fighter and love giving my human kisses. I am looking for a forever home where I'll be cherished forever and and kept safe. I will love you forever!!!\n\nNiko is utd on vaccinations, on flea/hw preventative and scheduled to be neutered and microchipped.\n\nNiko's adoption fee is $400 - obedience training is required after adoption\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups.

She is the messiest drinker and after a few slurps, the floor is a sloshy pool of drool. She is needy and does not like to be crated at all but she does not have separation anxiety to the point of destroying things. She is just happy to be with people. She does need a bath every few days at least until she is 100% over her skin infections or she does develop quite a strong smell. She is totally sweet as sugar though and very funny. Foster mom labels her as very high maintenance.\n\nPLEASE READ: Adopters will not be considered without completing an application. Please visit www.AmericanBulldogRescue.org to apply! Remember - Adoption is always the best option! If you can't help by adopting a homeless pet, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to American Bulldog Rescue, 4 Terry Drive, Suite 1D Newtown, PA 18940 or paypal AmericanBulldogRescue@verizon.net. We cannot place dogs in homes with children under 10 unless that dog has lived with kids or is in a foster home with kids. Thank you.\nTo be considered for adoption, you must apply using our free, online application. Our dogs are fostered in our volunteers' homes, not in a central shelter/location. Only approved applicants are put into contact with the foster family to setup a meeting with the foster dog. Visit our Adoption Policies web page for more information and a link to our application: http://americanbulldogrescue.org/adoption-policies/. 2/2/21 10:31 AM",

Love to go for long walks on the beach or hiking mountains? I'm the pup for you! Ok, so we don't have many beaches or any mountains nearby, but the point is I want to be with you every step of the way! I need a home where any children are at least in the teens, since I can be pretty playful. I need to meet any children and dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Bruno will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Bruno 1360387 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

I'm big and fluffy and SUPER shy, but once I get to know you, I'll let you pet me, especially if you have some of my favorite treats. I'm also attending some classes that work on shyness and fear.\n\nHere are some things that need in my new home:\n\n1.) A big fenced in yard where I can roam and play with my new canine siblings.\n\n2.) Other dogs as they help me relax.\n\n3.) Patient and calm human(s) who will let me acclimate at my pace.\n\nI recently started to get playful with my foster dad. Sometimes when he comes in the room, I'll turn a circle a couple times, go up to him, and playfully paw at him. I'm still nervous around him and will occasionally run out of the room when he enters, but I'm doing a lot better thanks to my foster siblings, my patient human, and my shyness classes. If you think we might be a good match, please apply to adopt me.\n\nWhen we meet, I may even let you pet me!\n\nI can't wait to meet you!\n\n~Madonna\n\nDate of birth (estimated): 6/22/20\n\nGood with Dogs: Yes\n\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nHouse Trained: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $425\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting this animal, please read the following before submitting an adoption application on our website - fureverhomerescue.com. Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, 4Dx test (covers tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis , Lymes, Ehrlichiosis) as well as heart worm) & de-worming.

His favorite things are getting pets, sleeping, rolling around in the yard and he gets very excited about breakfast and dinner. While Hamlet cannot see, he doesn't let that dull his spirits or stop him from getting around just fine. He also gets along well with other dogs in his foster home. Don't miss out on his big smile and his adorable little excitement hops, they're the best!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

To begin the process please fill out an application here:  http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\nThis is my foster dog...if you or anyone you know is interested in adopting this dog please contact: www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nName: \t\tAndy \nGender: \tNeutered \nColor:\t\tBlack/White\nDOB:\t\t02/07/2020\nBreed:\t\tGreat Dane Mix\nWeight:\t90 lbs  \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog's age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon't forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com/DogGoneInn",

Coming from a rural shelter in NM, she was terribly frightened and confused.  Her other companions were taken by another rescue, so are safe.  Mimi's distress caused her to come down with kennel cough, even though she was only in the shelter 1 day, but she is now healthy after treatment and ready to meet her new family.  Mimi has the beautiful long-legged and slender form of an Italian Greyhound but the pixie-ish face and head of a Chihuahua.  At 9 pounds, she is all legs!  She loves her new foster home, especially Dad, whom she snuggles with every morning while he enjoys his coffee.  She learned the doggie door very quickly, sleeps quietly in a crate, and has nice manners in the home.  She loves to bark at her neighbors dogs, so it is not recommended that she live in an apartment, but she would love a quiet home with a secure fence & yard, especially with another playful doggy companion.  We have learned this little girl can jump, so her yard needs a 6 ft. fence and gates that cannot be breached.  At 3 yrs. old, she still has plenty of energy and playfulness, and she loves to go for walks every day.  She is perfect for an active retired couple who can give her the love, attention, and security she needs.  Children under 10 are not recommended.  She cannot be spayed until 1/28/21 due to a backlog at veterinarians right now, but if the right family is found, she could go into a Foster-to-Adopt home with NMAF covering the cost of her remaining medical needs.  An APPLICATION is required to arrange a meet & greet.  Her adoption fee will be $195 which covers all shots, microchip, spay, & heartworm test.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

I was so glad to get off the streets and into the safety of the shelter. After waiting my allotted time I am now up for adoption.  The shelter gave me all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered. I am a ten-month-old terrier mix.  Now the folks here have noticed that I may have some hearing issues!  If you adopt me that means you will have to take extra special care of me by making sure I don\u2019t go outside unsupervised, that I have a fenced in yard, and I don\u2019t leave the house or yard except for a leash walk! That\u2019s not too hard! Hey you take care of me and I will do the same for you!\n",

This is the reason why an EXPERIENCED owner is a must, even better if you have experience with feral dogs. I would do best in a home with other dogs and with an owner who is very patient and willing to work with me to gain confidence and trust people.\nI love other dogs and really open up around them. I am quite the couch potato and always try to snuggle with my foster sibling. I enjoy being outside as well and playing chase. I LOVE the leaf blower and will get major zoomies while chasing the leaves. Hopefully I can find my furever home soon, with a little bit of effort i will be the best dog ever! Come meet me soon!",

She was not spayed, had no microchip, and was terribly frightened.  The shelter was unable to give her any shots as she was so terrified, so NMAF has started that regimen and will complete it with a spay, microchip, rabies, and heartworm test on 1/20/21.  She will be able to go to her new home by 1/25/21 if healed sufficiently. Cutie appears to be a mix, having lots of freckles on her skin and a few brown patches on her fur.  We love the one brown patch over her eye!  Possibly some Jack Russell in there!  She is small, under 10 pounds, very sweet, and responding well to affection and cuddles.  She gets along with the other dogs in her foster home and is adapting well.  She is fostered in Los Lunas and arrangements can be made to meet her in advance of adoption with an APPLICATION.  Her adoption fee will be $195 and include all shots, spay, microchip, and heartworm test.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

            "description": "Murphy is a 25lb neutered male sable & white Sheltie. Our vet estimates that he is around 2-3 years old. Murphy got a rough start in life, and he is a very reserved guy who will need a patient adoptive family experienced with fearful dog rehabilitation. He suffers from the autoimmune condition dermatomyositis (or DMS). There is no cure for DMS, but the symptoms can be controlled with medication, a low-stress household and great nutrition. Shelties with DMS can live long, happy lives with understanding and supportive families. Murphy seems to prefer women over men, but he can be won over with treats. A very securely fenced yard is required for Murphy's adoptive home, and his adoptive family should be prepared to leash walk him inside of the fenced yard for additional safety for the first few weeks after adoption. If you're interested in meeting or adopting Murphy, please fill out an application via our website scsheltierescue.com. His adoption donation of $300 includes neuter, all vaccinations and microchip.

She was not spayed, had no microchip, and was terribly frightened.  The shelter was unable to give her any shots as she was so terrified, so NMAF has started that regimen and will complete it with a spay, microchip, rabies, and heartworm test on 1/20/21.  She will be able to go to her new home by 1/25/21 if healed sufficiently.  She is under 10 pounds and responding well to affection and cuddles, which she enjoys.  Coco is a sweet girl but, like some of her breed, not good at sharing her person or persons and should be an ONLY dog.  Cats are an unknown at this point but, due to her size, it is expected a bigger cat will determine the rules of the home and should not be a problem.  While she lived with Cutie, we do not believe this is a bonded pair, so they can be adopted separately.  Arrangements can be made to meet her in advance of adoption with an APPLICATION.  Her adoption fee will be $195 and includes all shots, spay, microchip, and heartworm test.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

            "description": "Baby Girl was found cowering in a garage on New Year\u2019s Day. The person who found her tried to locate her family but was not successful. She is now available for adoption. The vet thinks Baby Girl is 3-4 years old. She weighs 52 pounds. She is a very sweet girl, but she is also timid. She is afraid of loud noises and takes a while to warm up to people. She needs another dog to play with and most likely a fenced yard. She would probably do well with older children but not younger ones. We are unsure about cats. Our adoption fee is $175 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay and a microchip.

I'm a perfect vacuum for under the table if you let me or I try to sneak eat the things you drop. I'm super rambunctious and love to play and run and play and run. I am kennel trained. I know what \"kennel\" means when my foster momma tells me its night time. Haven't had an accident in my kennel overnight. And i do good on going potty outside too!! I do whine if I'm in my kennel and hear and see everyone outside of it having fun or walking around. Cuz I wanna do that too!! I do know how to sit. And I know how to \"take it nice\" when I'm told and given treats. If I am in the kennel overnight I need to be covered and it be almost completely dark. But have I said I love to run and play? I came from Georgia so this white stuff is fun to eat! Taste like water though.  If you would like to adopt me I need lots of space to play and run. Am I repeating myself again? Ugh. I am $350.

            "description": "Are you looking for a Little love in your life? Look no further than the Little puppies! These sweet girls are playful, snuggly and just a bit mischievous. They came to Labs and More without a mom or dad so we aren't quite sure what their breed mix is or how big they will get. We are guessing they will stay on the smaller side. Smidge bounces around like Tigger and loves to play! Smidge is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

Speck is very playful and always wants to be in the middle of everything. Speck is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

Special thank you to SO SO many people that donated and supported this girl. Call out to Tom and Laura House that funded a large portion of her treatment \nBio from Julie Neville her AMAZING foster \nVery sweet older girl looking for a retirement home! Scrap is just about the perfect dog. Scrap very quiet, and she is a very happy dog. She is about 12 years old. She loves attention and wags her tail so fast when she is near you. Scrap is also housebroken. Scrap has two minor issues which any potential adopter would need to be willing to accept. First of all, Scrap is blind. Once she learns the layout of your house, she gets around very well and can even do stairs. Second of all, Scrap is diabetic. But please don't think that her diabetes is a daunting issue. Two meals a day and two insulin shots and she is good to go! Scrap does require a special food due to her diabetes which is a prescription food you can get from your vet's office. It is estimated that the total cost for her insulin, syringes, and prescription food would amount to approximately $130 per month. Scrap would love a quiet home (maybe with another older dog?) to spend her retirement years.Please submit an Adoption Application here: www.rocthedogsrescue.com",

Ready for the perfect hospice home/adoption.\n\nIn rescue the hardest thing can be saying goodbye to some of the most precious souls. If we don't do this, we deny another animal in need the space and care it also deserves .\n\nTiny Tim has roughly 1 year to live based on the doctors diagnosis. With that said, he is doing quite well on all his medications and the doctors have him comfortable:)\n\nAt 5.5lbs...he is very much like a little baby. I change his diapers a 5-8 times a day. He poos on a pee pad and needs cough and pain meds every 8 hours. His other meds every 12 hours. He begs for food. Prefers fresh pet for his meals and can get raging jealous of his siblings . He loves to snuggle and requires quite a few deep sleep naps during the day.\n\nHe suffers from severe mitral valve disease and his back has been broken and fused together. His heart ailment will eventually take his life.\n\nOur goal is to keep him comfy, as pain free as possible and happy as long as possible. We are looking for a compassionate, quiet home where he can be spoiled rotten and give you soooo much love in return .Please submit an Adoption Application here: www.rocthedogsrescue.com",

            "description": "Name: Howie (fka King)\nSuspected Breed: Bulldog Mix\nApproximate Age: 10 years old\nApproximate Weight: 76 lbs\nPersonality: Friendly and sweet\t\nObservations with Dogs: good with other dogs\nObservations with Cats: not yet tested\nObservations with Kids: not yet tested\nCurrently Living at: DMV-area foster\n\nCheck out Howie's adoption video here: https://youtu.be/yd4bQyqmuKs\n \nWho can resist that silver muzzle? Howie is a senior fellow whose owner was moving and surrendered him to the PG County shelter. He would like to spend his golden years in a warm and loving home. Howie is friendly and affectionate. He considers himself a lapdog and will attempt to sit in your lap despite his 76lbs! He is not very tall but is built like a tank. Despite his age, he is spry and loves toys and playing fetch. He was calm and cautious when introduced to other dogs. We have not tested him with kitties yet. \n\nHowie is a smart boy eager to please. He knows \"\"come\"\", \"\"sit\"\", and \"\"speak\"\". He's done well with crate training and house training and has good manners. Howie loves to sleep on the sofa curled up next to his foster and snores like bulldogs (and old fellas) often do. Despite having been left at a shelter in his old years, he maintains a very friendly and happy disposition. He's excited to find his forever family so that he can live out his golden years in a loving home. \n\nLike most shelter dogs, Howie may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS' fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.\n\nThe adoption fee for senior dogs is $200. If you are interested in adopting Howie, please submit an adoption application at https://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/adoption-application-dogs/ABOUT US & IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPlease note that you must use our official adoption application in order to be considered for adoption. Applying through other sites (i.e., Petfinder) will not work. The following are our applications:\n\nDog application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=1\nCat application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=6\n\nDC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.\n\nOur shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and are completely transparent about any known issues prior to adoption finalization. \n\nABOUT DC PAWS RESCUE\n\nOur rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based dog and cat rescue in the DC area. We rescue locally from Prince Georges County, MD, and from rural shelters in the south (presently Pickens County, Anderson County, and Greenville County in SC, and Raleigh County, WV).\n\nWe partner with a local rescuer in Pickens County, SC, who saves adoptable cats and dogs from the three area shelters. For the animals in this rural area, rescue is a critical lifeline, and often the only lifeline. Our rescue partner not only works with DC PAWS to save as many dogs and cats as possible, but she has also established a successful spay/neuter program in the community to decrease the number of homeless and unwanted animals over the long term.\n\nFOSTER AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFosters make it possible for DC PAWS to save and care for homeless, neglected and abandoned animals! To learn about fostering dogs or cats for DC PAWS Rescue, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/volunteer/fostering/foster-application\n\nSPONSOR AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFor any of our animals! Sponsors help us provide critical medical care, food, boarding, and other support for animals facing euthanasia. Individuals who sponsor a dog or cat receive special recognition on the animal's profile. Sponsorships can also be made in honor or memory of a loved one, and you may designate to whom DC PAWS Rescue should provide notice of your gift. Sponsorship levels of $250 and $150 include \"\"naming rights\"\" for a future dog or cat (respectively) that we rescue.\n\nTo learn more about sponsorship, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/donate/",

You cant be this hunky without being a little chunky. I'm certainly not the shy type either, I love to play with everyone. I will probably do best in a big backyard, where I will have room to run and play. If you are looking for big boy to share your home with call the shelter at 972-377-1898 and make a appointment to meet me!!!The adoption fee for this pet is $75.

His previous owner passed away and he has been stuck at a shelter for the past few months, so we had to rescue him! He is about 10 years old and weighs about 85 lbs, but he is extremely calm and mellow. Casper is house-trained, kennel trained, and is very well behaved. He's also super smart and knows sit, stay, and come. He loves to just laze around the house, get pets and he plays very gently with his smaller foster sibling. He enjoys going on walks and exploring, and has excellent leash manners. He is great with children (even toddlers)! He gets along with dogs and cats of all sizes/ages. Casper is recovering from a reaction to a grain allergy, so he will need to be fed a grain-free diet. Casper will be the best housemate youll ever have!\n\nDonate at codysfriendsrescue.org to help us save more lives! https://codysfriendsrescue.org/donate",

I am high energy and would love a family that is active but also loves to cuddle. I require an experienced owner as I can be protective of certain things of high value and can like my space at times. I love love love other dogs, however I would do best in a home without kids. I have seen a cat before and I am not sure what to make of it. \n\nI have to find my new forever home because I am a retired star from Sea World and due to COVID my show was canceled. \n\nAdoption requirements are as such: \n\n\n\tNo apartments\n\tNo children under 16 \n\tA home in Orlando \n\tNot a first time dog owner \n\tResource guarding experience \n\tNo cats \n\n\nPlease note, Rocco is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program.

I havent had any accidents in the house since I came to Buffalo. I do awesome in my crate to sleep and when my foster parents leave for a few hours. When I first got here I didnt really understand what toys were but have caught on quick and now love playing ball (I doesnt always return it) and chewing bones and stuffed toys. I understand when you say no and am learning sit, leave it and other commands. My foster dad says I walk pretty good with a harness but love to look at everything and walk back and forth in front of his feet. I dont seem to mind the cold and love flinging the snow around. \n\nMy foster mom gave me this thing called a bath when I first got here because I was really stinky and my pretty white coat was very dirty. I didnt like that much but have since stuck my head in the shower when shes in there so maybe water isnt that scary. \n\nI love to snuggle on the couch with my foster family and watch tv. I havent been around any little kids or cats but may be a little too much for either since I still act like a puppy. I get excited and sometimes jump. Im working on getting better. I seem to love other dogs but am still learning my boundaries. \n\nMy foster families favorite things about me are my sweet puppy kisses and my smushy cute face.\n\nIf you are interested in Dale please apply at https://www.nickelcitycaninerescue.org/adopt-a-dog or message the rescue if you are already pre-approved.",

She also is happy to give kisses! Sasha enjoys walks and does well on a leash. She is great with other dogs and kids. Sasha is very smart and already knows some basic commands. Sasha would do best in an apartment as she jumps fences. Please come and visit me at the Adoption Center inside PetSmart in Midland, TX! \n\nCheck out all the currently adoptable pets on www.midlandhumane.org/adoptables",

Ralphie is not good with livestock or poultry.\n\n$40.00 cash adoption fee (includes a microchip).\n\n$80.00 good-faith deposit will be collected at the time of adoption. If paying this fee by check, the check will be cashed. This added spay/neuter step will help stem the tide of animals that end up in shelters, many ultimately facing euthanization. Once sterilization has been completed, take or mail proof of surgery to the Humane Society of Calloway County, 607 Poplar St. (in the Weaks Center), Murray, KY 42071. Your $80.00 deposit will be reimbursed, typically within one week. \n\nPlease visit: murraycallowayanimalshelter.weebly.com to fill out an application.

            "description": "Gorgeous 3 year old purebred male rottweiler. Great with kids. Grew up with young children in the house. He likes female dogs but hasn't been around too many males so we don't know how he does with males. He needs basic obedience training but is a well behaved boy in general and wants to please his owner. He will need to be neutered on the 25th of January, before he can be adopted. If you llive in the East valley then you might be able to foster him until you can adopt him on the 25th. \nOur Adoption Process... If you are interested in adopting one of our fun loving not so rotten rotties, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that will allows us to get to know you better and to make sure the dog you are looking at is a good fit for your family and lifestyle. You can access our questionnaire by going to our website, www.rottenrottie.com click on the forms tab, and fill out the questionnaire and submit it online. After we review your answers, if we feel that the dog that you are interested in, is not a good fit for you and your family, we may recommend a different rottweiler companion. After we determine which Rottweiler(s) is the best for you, we will set up a time so that you can meet him or her at their house, where they will feel most comfortable and act as they normally do. An adoption contract will be signed to finalize the adoption and we do ask for a rehoming fee of $400 for most adults, $250 for most of our seniors 6 years and above for any rottweiler mix of any age (except puppies) . Our fees for puppies fluctuate depending on how much we had to invest into them or their litter, and weather they are purebred or a mix. These funds are necessary so that our organization may continue to rehome rottweilers. ALL of our dogs are sterilized, fully vaccinated and microchipped, heartworm tested negative and come with a collar and a leash. We have also addressed any injury or illness that they had when they came to us, or received in foster care. These problems will be disclosed to the adopter prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Update: Nakoma is with a foster,  he is potty trained and sleeps all night snuggled in bed with him. He's a good boy, still anxious and decompressing after 6 days of freedom. He is scared of loud noises, becomes very anxious and jumps in a loud city environment when going for walks. He's being fostered in LA and needs a quiet neighborhood and setting to live in so if you don't live in the hustle n bustle areas, reach out for this deserving boy! \n\nThis gorgeous blue eyed boy is one of our favorite and special rescues. He was just rescued after 7 months, yes I said 7 months of being locked up, passed up and was fed up of being kenneled. His name was Ren, he was depressed, mad and had given up! He was reported as hard to handle and no hope in sight until Alljoy4paws came and had faith in him that he was a good boy and just needed to trust again,  feel loved again and treated with kindness and respect. With this new chance comes a new life with a new name and he was named Nakoma which means great warrior and great spirit which he earned for making it out of the shelter after so long, especially for a husky. Nakoma was nothing that the shelter described, he walked out a little nervous and unsure what was happening but quickly realized he was saved and free. He jumped right into the car as fast as the door opened in the backseat and he raced to the passenger seat and called \"Shotgun\"! He road like a gem in the car and he smiled the whole way too! In fact, he never stopped smiling the 3.5hrs we were together. Check his pics! He might be a little cautious at first but warms up very quickly.  He wants that loving wonderful life that you can give him! He loves dogs and people and just wants to be part of the pack. He walks like a dream on a leash although given the chance to get loose from his collar, he was all about wanting to feel free and just run, I don't blame him after what he's been through. By the end of our time this hard to handle 5yr old was jumping up to give me gentle hugs and kisses. When he saw his new collar and leash, he gave them kisses, awwww!\nHe's decompressing right now and getting back to his fun self and ready for a great husky savvy foster or adopter to make all of his doggy wishes come true! Could that be you? We can't wait to hear from you!",

He is a beautiful 70lb, brindle believed to be a mixture of possibly Mountain Cur, Catahoula or Terrier, whatever he is, hes absolutely stunning with one blue eye and one brown eye! He is still working on his manners and may get a little excited when you first get home or wake up in the morning, but he relaxes pretty quickly and can lay on the couch with you with you all night long. He gets along wonderfully with other dogs and cats, and is a quick learner! If youre looking for a dog that wants all of the love then hes the one for you! Better he has a home without kids.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

Now, they're in foster and looking for a new forever home, hopefully together again. Lennox is a rottweiler/border collie mix with short legs. He's a little overweight, but on a diet in his foster home. He also appears to have some arthritis, but loves to go for walks with Mo and never slows down his hippity hop. At home, he'll sit on his foster's lap if she's on the floor, but can't jump up onto the couch to do it. He loves to lie in the yard and watch the world and squirrels go by. He's a well house-trained boy, very alert and always ready to go outside. He sleeps through the night on the carpet, and he sits on command! There's never a discouraging word out of this boy. He and Mo roughhouse at least once a day. Come meet him and Mo, they'll grab your heart!",

T-Bone was abandoned by his owners and was not cared for very well. He needs a refresher course in house training, but he's very smart and should be house trained in no time. T-Bone lives with another dog in his foster home so he would do great in the home with other dogs, but he would prefer a cat-free home. T-Bone does fine when he's left on his own to roam in the home, and is not destructive in any way. He does well in a crate and is quiet and calm, which means you can relax knowing he is safe in his crate while you're out and about running your errands. T-Bone is very well mannered and it took him weeks to finally get up on the couch or bed with encouragement from his humans. He is very polite when accepting food. does not beg or steal. He will jump on humans only when he is very excited, but does this rarely and can easily be trained to stop this behavior. T-Bone loves human attention. He only wants to love and be loved! He enjoys being near you, touching you for affection. He enjoys meeting new people, and is very friendly and enjoys receiving pats. He likes to snooze on the bed or couch or on the deck in the sun. He's not much for toys, but is very playful. He is very calm and gentle and enjoys chilling and relaxing. T-Bone is mellow and patient and is willing to be trained. He would love a home with another dog to play with. He would love a calmer and less active home. He has cancer and is heartworm positive which means he will need low key activity and rest while he recovers from his heartworm treatment at APA's! expense. Are you able to teach T-Bone that humans are good and can be trusted? Come meet this sweet and loving boy today!",

He may be part Shepherd, part herding breed, we aren't sure, this is all speculation. But Elfie is young, and very active and has what seem like some herding instincts.\nElfie is sweet and affectionate and a great dog but he will need a household that can help him live out his activity drives, plenty of activity, motion, walks, dog park, etc. It would be ideal for him to romp around with another dog if possible or eventually. He does need a fenced in yard, he needs to move around and explore freely.\n\nElfie is @ 36 lbs, and @ 8 -9 months old.\n\nOn Elk Hounds:\n\nElkhounds are famously fine companions and intelligent watchdogs. Agility and herding trials are good outlets for their natural athleticism and eagerness. Reserved until introductions are made, an Elkhound is a trustworthy friend ever after. These strong, confident dogs are truly sensitive souls, with a dash of houndy independence.\n\nIf you are interested in Elfie see below, please fill out our form.\n\nredemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll dogs age appropriate vetted:\n\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@8 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

Ore is a one year old pitbull-bullmastiff mix, with a sweet, but inexperienced and nervous disposition. \n\nHe loves snacks and toys, and respects tall gates. Ore can be crated, but should also be able to be left out with ease. \n\nOre has had limited testing with other animals so far - he seems unfamiliar, but friendly. \n\nIf you are ready to help Ore catch up on his socializing, reach out!

            "description": "My name is Winston and I am a 4 year-young stunning pit bull with a great smile!  My hazel eyes drive the ladies crazy.  Woof, woof!!  I love to go on hikes and I also love long car rides.  Being scratched on my shoulders and butt are my favorite things in the whole wide world!  Woof!!  I also love spending the afternoon curled up on the couch watching TV next to my human.  Unfortunately, things haven\u2019t always been easy for me.  My previous living situation was not the best and I wasn\u2019t always treated well.  I heard my former dad was going to drop me on the streets because he got evicted from his home and he couldn\u2019t keep me.  Luckily, that didn\u2019t happen.  Grrrrr...\n\nEnough about my past.  I\u2019m looking forward to a bright future with my new family and friends.  I currently reside in Tustin, CA with my foster humans and foster brother Oz.  I get along with the mellow yellow kinda dogs with proper introduction and guidance, but please no puppies or dogs with high energy...or cats.  Oh yeah, don\u2019t even get me started with cats!  I don\u2019t want to live with an animal that poops in the house... yuck!\n\nMy personal trainer, Katie, is my BFF and has helped me a lot in just the month I\u2019ve been living in Tustin.  She keeps telling me what a good boy I am.  I really am a good boy and love to please.  I don\u2019t get bothered by skateboards or bicycles when I got for walks.  In fact, the lady that is taking care of me lets me trot next to her while she rides a razor... so cool!  Woof!!  \n\nI really need someone with dog experience who can show me the ropes and show me true love.  Are you that special someone for me??  Please contact Shelli Dall with any questions at 619.818.0054.  I hope to meet you soon!  \n\n\nPlease help us get Winston into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Winston, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

SUCH AN ANGEL, SHE IS ALWAYS READY TO PLEASE HER HUMAN. CRATE TRAINED, HOUSE BROKEN, LEASH TRAINED, AND IS ALMOST OBEYING THE \"SIT\" COMMAND CINNABON WILL NEED SOMEONE WITH TIME TO DEVOTE TO HER TRAINING AS SHE IS A PUP. FURTHERMORE, SHE WILL NEED PATIENCE AS SHE WILL NOT INITIALLY TRUST A NEW HUMAN BUT WARMS UP VERY QUICKLY!

Mia is a really sweet girl and doing well in her foster home.  She loves people and is great with the older children she has been around.  While she likes to play with other dogs, sometimes she seems to play a bit too rough for some of them.  We assume she  probably had never been around other dogs  prior to coming to the rescue and with guidance will learn limits.   Mia is about year old and 40lbs.  She is potty and crate trained, does well on a leash. This girl is so cute with her short legs and little boots.    Our Mia would love nothing better than to have a best friend(s) that would love her as much as she would them.  If you are looking for a cute, happy, lovable new mate,  look no further than our sweet girl Mia!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting our sweet little low-rider , please visit our website at www.littleraysofsunshineanimalrescue.org and fill out an application.

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nRamon is a little chihuahua mix born around 7/2006.  This little man has a sad story and we are hoping for a happy ending for him, even if its not for long.    Ramon is all of 7 lbs with very long legs.   Ramon's owner decided that she could not care for him because of her pregnancy, we are not here to judge but its pretty sad.   Ramon is sweet, calm and pretty easy to get along with.  His labwork shows that he is in early stages of kidney failure, has a severe heart murmur and bad dental disease (unfortunately because of his heart and kidneys he is not an anesthesia candidate).   So, we are looking for someone special to provide a forever home for Ramon, even though it likely wont be for long considering his health.  He will need special food.  We do have a foster for him in the meantime, but a forever place would be even better.   Ramon likes to play with toys, enjoys other small dogs and is sweet with everyone he meets, what a nice little man.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 1/13/2021\nAdoption fee:  To be discussed, we just want to make sure that whoever adopts him his the means to continue his special diet and vet visits if needed.\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

She gets her name from the chomping sound she makes when she gets very excited. Allie weighs about 70 pounds and is about two years old.  She was found running down a highly trafficked street. She is extremely loving and wants nothing but pets and attention. \n\nPet Friends' staff will socialize with her and give her some leash training.  Allie's high energy will need to be channeled through regular exercise and playtime with her owners.\n\nIf you're interested in large breed dogs and are an exercise enthusiast, Allie might be the dog you're looking for.  Call our office for a meet and greet if you are interested in Allie.  Your application will be sent for approval after you have met Allie.  \n\nOur office number is (831) 634-1191.  We are located in Hollister CA, about 100 miles south of San Francisco.  Sorry, we do not ship our animals.  See all our animals on our website http://www.petfriends.org.",

I am crate trained, know how to sit, and I sleep on a dog bed or my humans bed at night if allowed. I could use work on my house training. I have learned a lot this past year but I just need some more help because I am very energetic and just want to play outside!

            "description": "Phoenix is a 4 1/2 lb 3 yr old male Chihuahua. River is a 6 lb 6 yr old female Chihuahua. We believe River is mom. This duo is COMPLETELY bonded and will not be separated. They were surrendered by an owner that kept them in the backyard without attention or enough food. They are both still working on gaining some weight. The owner only had them about 4 months -- we do not have any history prior to. River is quite social and very affectionate. Phoenix is a bit timid and takes him longer to trust. Both are so adorable and incredibly gentle. Neither are barkers -- River does bark at and chase cats. This duo is now pad trained and doing great with going outside to potty thru the dog door. Their ideal home will have the human/s home more than not. No cats. Any other dogs in the home will need to be very gentle. These 2 are incredibly affectionate and love to sleep with their foster mom at night.\nIf you are interested in this duo please fill out an adoption application at www.casadeloveanimalrescue.org \n**Adoption fee $550\n***If post is up they are available",

If you have a specific question that is not covered in the profile, please send us a message. \n\nClara grew up in a home with way too many dogs and is now learning how to appreciate the company of people. She absolutely loves to be held and cuddled but sometimes hides until she is reminded how much she likes it. Clara is fearful when she first meets and would prefer a quiet home with one or two adults and not a lot of social functions. Her ideal home would be with someone who would take her for short daily runs and has a backyard to explore. She is small, not even 8 lbs, so you won\u2019t have to run far to meet her exercise needs.\n\nClara has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and had her teeth cleaned. Her adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Clara, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: http://wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

His smile is to die for and a day will never go by without a smile on his new family's face. Fitz does well with other dogs, but can become affection jealous so would do best with a dog who doesn't mind sharing the attention and will back off if Fitz gets jealous. Does Fitz sound like he can be the one for you? He is about 9-years-old and a Terrier mix.\n\n*Please complete our online application for further consideration. We do best fit for both dog and family, and completing an application is not a guarantee of approval.",

If the dog is posted it is available for adoption! Once adopted or applications are not being accepted, it will be removed from this page! \n\nThis happy little girl 30 pound girl, Aurora, is a puppy herself but also a mama to seven little ones. As soon as she has completed nursing her babies and they are off to their new homes our sweet little  Aurora gets to start her own life! She will be able to go to her new home around the second week in February but she can be pended now!\n\nAurora is a 1 year old little lovebug that wants her own attention and her own family and home. She loves to play with other dogs, children and is good with cats! She's curious about life and wants to share many adventures! Are you looking for a life long buddy?

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Sugar Mama, a 2-year old, 75-pound Labrador/ American Bulldog mix young lady.\n\nIn an all too common story, Sugar Mama's parents have decided to divorce and neither feels they can take her into their new situation, leaving her homeless.\n\nSugar Mama is a sweetheart. Because she spent her whole life with one family where she knew nothing but love, so she is full of love herself. \n\nSugar loves people and kids, gets along great with other dogs. She does make exceptions for cats, however.  She didn\u2019t grow up with them and doesn\u2019t want to include them in her friendship circle. \n\nSugar loves her treats and would benefit for a home where she gets regular exercise as she is a bit chunky. \n\nSugar cant wait to find her forever home where she can lay her doggie bed down, gets lots of attention and love\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Sugar Mama*, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

Most of your questions will be answered in this biography.\n\n*Housetrained\n*Doing Well on Leash\n*Crate Trained: \n*Good Option w/Older Children\n\nSNICKERS  is a sweetie seeking her forever family! \n\nThis affectionate girl would love to be chilling next to you with her head on your lap. And then curl up on her dog bed for a nice long nap. She loves her naps! She has a mellow, laid back personality. But she also enjoys playtime, especially playing with squeaky balls. Throw the ball to her and watch her catch it mid-air. This girl has got skills! \n\nShe\u2019s house trained and crate trained. She is great with kids. She walks nicely beside you on a leash though sometimes she gets excited and jumps around when she sees other dogs. She\u2019s working on that! Snickers doesn\u2019t do well with other dogs in the home because she gets possessive of \u201cher\u201d humans. So she must be an only dog. It\u2019s not known how she is around cats though a test can be arranged.\n\nSnickers and her foster mom have worked together with a professional trainer ton basic obedience and those tips of the trade will be passed along to the adopter.  \n\nWe believe SNICKERS to be a HOUND/SHIP mix. Her estimated DOB is 10/12/2019, and she weighs 41 pounds.\n\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit our website at www.youluckydogrescue.org and read our Adoption FAQ's and Before You Adopt documents. You can complete an online adoption application from our website. You can also email info@youluckydogrescue.org for additional details that are not included in this biography.\n\nPRIVATE MEET & GREETS: Submitting an adoption application is required before a private meet & greet will be scheduled. We will complete a pre-screening first to make sure that the dog you are interested in is a good fit for you. That way, we don't unnecessarily waste your time or the foster's time. \n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay or neuter and microchipping. All of our rescue dogs are heart worm tested annually beginning at 9 months of age, and they are kept on monthly heart worm and flea preventatives.\n\nThe breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog. We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue. \n\nWe are located in the metro Atlanta area. We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.\n\nwww.youluckydogrescue.org - Adoption Application can be found at this website.",

            "description": "Rock on with Rocky! Rocky is an awesome dog, with a charming, happy personality to match his handsome looks. Rocky has a little fan club among volunteers and is regularly described as happy-go-lucky, friendly and easy-going. This is in spite of seeing some hardship in his life - he arrived at the kennel heartworm positive, and with a badly broken tail that unfortunately had to be amputated. Despite this, Rocky seems to have an upbeat outlook on life and is looking to be someone's best buddy! He has a playful, silly spirit and a big affectionate side; given the chance, he will drape himself over your lap for pets and cuddles. Since he is heartworm positive, Rocky will require treatment. The cost is covered by Friends of City Dogs Cleveland, Rocky just needs to find a home where he can rest and recover for a while before getting back to normal fun dog stuff! Rocky is around 4 years old and weighs close to 50 lbs. Visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to set up a meet with Rocky and find out more about him!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.4 Lucky Dogs has no facility in which to view dogs. All of our dogs are in loving fosters homes throughout West Central Florida. To be considered, please apply for our dogs at www.4luckydogs.org. As a general rule we do not adopt outside of the state of Florida unless the person/family is known to our rescue.\nIt's time to find Willow her forever home. She has some home requirements so please read before proceeding. Willow came to us as if she had never seen a human before. It was obvious her experience with people was not positive. She is timid and afraid of almost everything. A month later and she allows her foster mom to touch her and has even wandered over to initiate touch. This is a huge improvement for her.\nHer new home will need to be extremely patient with her. Allow her to adjust and decompress. This could take months possibly.\nShe requires a fenced yard. This is for her safety. If she were to escape, she will RUN and as scared as she is of everything, it would be hard to catch her, and she would put herself in grave danger.\nShe requires another dog or two in the home. Preferably a confident medium to larger size. She has been initiating play especially in the morning. (Shes an early riser.)\nShe enjoys her crate. She feels comfortable in it. Currently the door is left open so she can retreat if needed. However, she will spend ALL day in it if allowed. She has also presented with some resource guarding of it when her foster siblings got too close and growled. It is important to help her engage in life outside the crate.\nShe is very treat and food motivated. Has been known to counter surf to get to those bag of treats you may have left laying around.\nShe sneaks toys. She seems to like the antlers and is so cute watching her chew on them. It's likely she never had anything like that before.\nShe appears to be housetrained and has not had an accident since the first couple of days in her foster home. Most likely she learned this from her foster siblings. She has full run of the house at night and when her fister mom is home. She does go in her crate when her foster mom isn't home but again, it's for her safety as it's unknown what she may try and get into when not being supervised.\nNo little kids. Fast movements frighten her, loud noises frighten her, too much going on at one frightens her. Also small toys could easily get destroyed or consumed resulting in major problems.\nShe is not leash trained. The outside world is terrifying for her which is why the fenced yard is required. She will bolt if given the opportunity and a double leash would be recommended when leaving the home if she must. Dog parks and outdoor venues are not recommended for her. (At least not at this time.)\nShe does love attention. Although nervous, she has never attempted to bite or snap at anyone. As your hand goes closer and closer, you can see the fear, however, once the ear scratches and rub down begins, she relaxes and seems to enjoy it. Her foster mom has also placed her on the sofa with her and immersed her in pets and she fell asleep on her lap.\nAgain...slow is key.\nShe is a great girl and in time will make a perfect companion. Even one month in she is a different dog. It's important to get her to her new home so she can acclimate to the change. She has been an easy dog to foster. Willow's adoption fee is $400 and she comes spayed and microchipped and fully vaccinated for a year.",

Not only does he enjoy being near you, but he also likes spending time running around our play yards. Ricky will do well with an active family and can\u2019t wait to go on countless adventures with you! He is friendly with other dogs, but seems a little unsure about cats. Ricky is available for pre-adoption while he waits for his visit to our vet at the end of the month.\nHe weighs 60 pounds and is 1 year old. Before adoption, Ricky will be neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, and take preventive flea/tick/heartworm medicine. \nAs with all of our dogs, Ricky must be an indoor dog. If you are interested in pre-adopting Ricky, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com. If you cannot attend your scheduled visit, kindly text or call the volunteer you are meeting with before your scheduled visit. They are taking time out of their day to meet with you. Thank you!",

She\u2019s very gentle however a home without small children may be the best fit for her as she learns to trust and acclimate to new surroundings. She is an absolute gem. She came in with her brother Clyde and anyone interested in the pair, will jump to the top of our applicant list. They are bonded but are fine separated and are currently as we await their scheduled spay/neuter. She came in with a mild fever and is currently on medication, though it appears to be nothing serious. She has recently had a litter but she is still very young.\nIf you are interested in Bonnie, please check us out on Facebook at Project Cecil Rescue Ranch or fill out an application at Projectcecilrescue.com under the adoptions tab.",

            "description": "Hello, everyone!  My name is Jackie (HWTH#21020A).  I am a Siberian Husky mix, born 1/20/20 and I weigh 37 lbs.  I was found by a good Samaritan in Palmdale.  My owners never came to get me so I was relinquished to Halfway to Home to find my forever family.  I am a friendly, energetic girl who hopes to find owners who enjoy an active lifestyle.  I like going for long walks, and other outdoor activities such as hiking and camping would be right up my alley!  I need a big yard with a tall fence to run and play when we aren't out on our adventures, so I would not be a good fit for an apartment or condo.   Obedience training is important so that I learn what is expected of me, and it will help me bond with you.  I have not spent much time around other dogs or children, but I am a playful girl so I would probably enjoy having one or both as playmates to keep me entertained.  Cats are also an unknown for me, but cats and Huskies are generally not a good match.  Huskies do shed, so regular brushing will keep my coat shiny and clean. More than anything else, I want to be treated as a member of the family, and in return I think you will find me to be a loyal and loving companion.  If you would like more information about me, or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele# 661-824-4495 (this is a landline phone).  Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and I hope to meet you soon!",

Now he's spending time with Furkids so he can find a forever home. He is a high energy young pup that needs someone experienced and willing to work with him to be the best dog he can be. We believe he was previously abused, and needs to learn that humans can be kind. Also, Bullseye's home must be without children or small animals (in residence or visiting). Bullseye is almost a year old (est. birth date 2/15/2020) and his adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Bullseye, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only.

            "description": "This especially sweet, extraordinarily handsome boy is Clyde. He is probably no more than a couple years old. He came to the rescue with his sister Bonnie and his friend Cupcake, who may or may not also be related. He is very bashful, to the point of appearing almost fearful but absolutely loves people and attention once he warms up. He is very bonded with Bonnie and preferential treatment would be given to any family interested in adopting the pair together. They have never been separated, however neither is currently fixed so they\u2019ve had to be separated here at the rescue until they\u2019re spayed and neutered. Clyde deserves a lot of love and bonding time. He may need a home without small children due to his bashful personality. Please message us if interested, check us out at Project Cecil Rescue Ranch on Facebook or send in an application today! You can find the applications at Projectcecilrescue.com under the adoptions tab!",

As such, he's discovering what it means to be in a loving home with food, water and toys to play with. Huxley's foster family has been working on some basic training and is happy to report that he understands \"sit\" and \"no\" and also goes into his crate nicely. Huxley is a strong boy weighing in at 80 lbs and pulls quite a bit on his leash. Huxley would be best as an only dog in the home and one without children under 16 and cats. Huxley loves to play with toys and go for car rides. He also likes to play ball in the backyard. He's only been in his foster home for a few months and come a long way, but he's fearful of meeting new people, and is being crated anytime a visitor comes to the home Huxley's owner will need previous Weim or large dog breed experience who can commit to helping Huxley become the great dog he has the potential to be. Patience and positive reinforcement will be needed and of course - time.",

They were likely not well socialized by their previous owner, and as a result, they are very protective of each other and MUST be the only pets in the home. But if you are looking for fun, loving companionship-Chautza and Pongo will fill your heart and home. They would be fine with older children and would love a fenced-in yard to run and play.

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName: Tyke\nSize: ~Large range: 61-100 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Neutered Male, Vaccinations current, Microchip, Older considerate children only, Not Apartment-friendly, NO Cats, NO Small Dogs\n\nTyke is such a ham! You're going to love him!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nNO Cats; NO Small dogs\n\n*\nOlder considerate children only\n\n*\nTyke needs to go to a home with another large-sized dog - he needs a dog buddy his size to help him feel comfortable and confident!\n\n1/13/21: If you have been thinking that there is too much extra space on your couch, Tyke is the dog for you! He can be skeptical of new people at first (and is selective about men), but once he warms up, he loves being around his people! If you are thinking about adopting Tyke, know that it takes him a couple of weeks to start to settle in, and he needs slow introductions to new people. If your home is a busy place with lots of people coming and going, Tyke isn't the dog for you. He also seems to do best on a fairly predictable schedule. The good news is he loves his kennel, and he often goes there voluntarily to get some alone time.\n\nThis sweet boy has had quite the journey over his 9 months with me. In August and September, we went through a positive reinforcement training program to work on his reactivity (using a clicker and lots of treats) and we have continued to use this training to help Tyke. We hope his new home will be willing to continue this work. Tyke is very treat-motivated, so he enjoys practicing with the clicker!\n\nIn November, Tyke had surgery on his knee, his recovery went really well.\nWe have been working on taking longer walks to keep building up his strength, and he does love going on walks of about a mile. He has also loved being able to play in the snow. Tyke has done really well living in an apartment, but I think he would love having a backyard to play in.\n\nAdopting Tyke will require patience and a commitment to keep working with him, but the reward is great! He is such a loving boy and has been working hard to get ready for his new home.\n\n6/12/2020: Tyke spent a few days in another home and he struggled to adjust to the new noises and the new people. He doesn't like surprises! If you are interested in adopting Tyke, know that it will take some time for him to settle in. If you are in an apartment where noise is an issue and you need to be conscientious of your neighbors, Tyke may not be a good fit.\n\nWhen he first came to stay with me, every new voice that he heard outside my apartment got him up and moving (and barking). Now that Tyke has settled in, he is so calm. There have been many apartment showings in my building over the past week, and even though we can hear the voices of people coming in and out, Tyke is content to just relax and listen. The only time he has barked recently is if I am trying to sleep in and he wants his breakfast. He likes his food and his treats!\n\nTyke is doing better and better with new people. I took him to the lake with my parents and he went right up to them right away with no growling. He loved the long car ride out and back, and all the hiking that we were able to do.\n\nI have learned so much about Tyke over the past month - he is really a special guy and is looking for a forever home!\n\n5/21/2020: I have had Tyke for almost two weeks now and he has been a fantastic addition to my home. If you are looking for a snuggle buddy, Tyke is your guy!\n\nHe does pretty well on his leash, but he is easily distracted by all the fun things to smell. Tyke handles running into other dogs really well - he is able to calmly walk by them even if they are barking. He has gotten many comments on how well behaved he is.\n\nI haven't tested him out with other people beyond the people we meet on our walks. He can (rarely) growl and lunge when new people approach him, and he will hide behind me if there is a large group. Tyke is the friendliest dog once he warms up to you, but it may take some time. I would recommend that he not go to a home with younger children as he can lunge when he is startled and he doesn't always realize his strength. I hope that Tyke can go to a home that can make him feel comfortable and safe, and that will have the patience for his quirks!\n\nTyke is potty trained and crate trained. I leave him out at night and he sleeps quietly (aside from occasional, adorable snoring) on his bed.\n\n4/22/2020: Tyke is such a sweetheart, who's favorite things to do are going for walks and cuddling with his humans. Once we get back from a walk he will jump up on the couch and nap until he's ready to go again!\n\nWe have had absolutely no accidents and he hardly ever barks! The only time we've heard Tyke bark is when he meets men, so slow introductions would be best with new people (especially guys). Once he realizes that they will give him lots of pets, he loves them and warms up quickly. He would do best in a home where there isn't a lot of people coming and going. He also loves the company of other dogs and would love to have a dog buddy to show him that people are not scary. Tyke is an awesome dog who just wants lots of love!\n\n4/10/2020 Volunteer Feedback: Tyke just came to the rescue today, and I've spent a bit of time today getting to know him. He is a super sweet boy; very well mannered, affectionate, and kind of goofy! He knows how to sit, although he is very treat motivated so he can't sit still for too long before he starts getting wiggly because he wants the treat! He met both of my dogs and did great with them. He likes to play but is also content just to follow them around. I took Tyke and my two dogs for a walk - he is great on a leash! He sometimes pulled a bit if he really wanted to sniff something, but he by no means was dragging me around.\n\nTyke seems kennel trained and potty trained. I met him at our facility early this morning and hung out with him for a bit. I left for about 4 hours and came back. He went into his kennel fine when I left, and it was clean when I got back. I had put a blanket and some bones in his kennel and when I returned, the blanket was still intact and it appeared he had kept busy chewing on the bone! He waited to do his business once we got outside. We are still getting to know this handsome fella, and will hopefully get him into a foster home soon to learn more about him. Check back for more feedback soon!To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org 2/2/21 1:34 PM",

His owner took good care of him but unfortunately died suddenly and the family did not want to keep MJ or his sister Bailey.\n\nMJ's sister was a labradoodle and was adopted very quickly. Being that MJ is older, he is still looking for his for the rest of his life home.\n\nMJ's foster loves him and says he is the sweetest dog you will ever meet. He likes other dogs and loves to wear clothes. MJ has an outfit for each day of the week and loves to play dress up.\n\nIf you are looking for an older, more relaxed companion, take a look at MJ.\n\nMJ has a special senior adoption fee of $200.

            "description": "**This dog has a bite record-- Please read below thoroughly before applying!**\n\nCalli was thrown from a truck on a freeway, and immediately afterward was clipped by oncoming traffic. A good samaritan stopped to try to catch her, and once he did he rushed her to an emergency vet where luckily they found she just had superficial scrapes and a bruised lung which would heal on it\u2019s own. Calli's all healed now, and is ready for adoption! \n\nCalli\u2019s background is a mystery, but the vet confirmed she\u2019s about a year old, 42-ish lbs (she should be around 45-46 lbs once she puts on more weight). She\u2019s timid at first with new people, but warms up quickly (especially with women) and easily becomes a velcro, cuddly, dog. She\u2019s young and energetic, and would benefit from a family that can give her a good amount of exercise and basic obedience training.\n\nShe needs slow introductions to new dogs, and can be defensive (gives warnings by showing her teeth) if cornered by a pushy unfamiliar dog. If she\u2019s in a home with other dogs, she should be separated at meal times and when she has something high-value. She has gotten into tussles and a fight with her previous foster sibling over chews, and her foster mom was bitten and scratched up in the process of breaking up the fight-- no puncture from the bite, but it did break skin and warranted her label as having a 'bite history'. In her new foster home, she has had zero incidences with the resident dog and humans.\n\nCalli is not kid-tested. She is OK with dog-friendly cats but should be supervised at all times around cats, because she does try to play with them. She will need obedience training and structure in her new home to make sure she matures into a great canine citizen. So far she\u2019s good in her crate overnight and between walks, knows 'place', sit, and 'wait', and is working on her loose leash walking and recall. On walks she only reacts to other dogs if they bark at her, but it's easy to get her attention back on her handler. \n\nIf you want to give this sweet girl a second chance at life, apply at harasf.org/application!",

She's between 5-6 years old but is a spunky, sassy and sometimes stubborn, but very entertaining medium-energy dog. She is very sweet and loving once she feels comfortable and truly loves spending time and being with her people. She enjoys running/playing/being chased and spending time outdoors, but is equally content snuggling and binge-watching your favorite program. She knows basic commands, is house and crate trained.\n\nShe would do best in a home with an experienced pitbull owner (who knows how to be the alpha), a fenced-in yard and as an only pet, but she does do ok with more submissive male dogs with a slow and proper introduction. NO CATS, SMALL DOGS and older children only. She will not do well in an apartment environment and we will not consider an application unless it meets the description above. \n\nIf you can give Gracie a foster or forever home, please send an email to jerseygirlsanimalrescue@gmail.com for an application.\nAdoption fee $300",

            "description": "Here's what my foster family has to say about me! Hi there! My name is Gravy, and I am quite the heartthrob! Are you looking for a couch companion? A walking buddy? Someone to split that turkey sandwich with? Well, then I'm your guy! They say I'm nine years old, but I am young at heart. Wherever you go, or whatever you do, I'm just happy to be by your side. Humans are my absolute favorite. I don't particularly like the resident kitties at my foster home, so I would prefer to live without felines. I like to lunge at other dogs on the street (no barks or growls), so I might also do better being in a home without any other dogs. My foster parents have been working on my lunging behavior and they think I'm getting better. When I'm not out walking or hiking with my foster parents, I love to lay on the couch and get my belly rubbed. If you let me sleep in your bed, I'll let you sleep until 10am. I do well in my crate if need be, but would prefer to be next to you! I've been known to be a picky eater, but nothing a little bit of wet food mixed into my dry kibble can't fix. I can't wait to find my forever home! As long as I get some turkey and lots of love, I'll always be there for you. Interested in learning more about Gravy? Contact his foster directly at msbarker@ucdavis.edu !",

            "description": "Oh, Louie. If you are looking for a roly, poly, opinionated ball of fur - Look no further! Louie is your main man.  All 27 pounds of him.  He is a chihuahua mix, about 8 years young. Louie came to us very sick, but recovered quickly and is doing well. He is a bit of a spit fire, and likes to keep his world small. He enjoys short walks, and sitting outside if it isn\u2019t too cold for short amounts of time. Believe it or not, he can run - but it reminds us of the cutest waddling duck you could ever find. He likes comfy beds, and is learning about toys. He enjoys stuffed toys, and will chase them a little bit while grunting and growling playfully like a little piggie. Louie does like to beg his foster mom for food, though we are working on convincing him to take a more active role in the lifestyle change we have bestowed upon him.  He is looking for a calm home, without small children. Louie takes some time to warm up to new people, and can be easily startled. He is looking for a patient home to help him continue to build his confidence, and help him feel safe. While he may disagree, we are also looking for a home who will be committed to helping him work towards a healthier future with a diet and exercise plan. Louie has lived with other dogs his entire life, however he is not a big fan of sharing attention, food, or toys with them and may do best living out his golden years as the only dog in the household. Given Louie\u2019s nervousness with new people, we would also be open to a foster to adoption home for him, where he would remain in our foster program for a few weeks while our trainers provide any support needed to ensure a smooth transition. We know he may be looking for just the right home, but trust us - he is worth it!  He is snuggly, sweet, and can we say adorable!!! \nThe adoption donation for Louie is $100.  This donation helps to cover veterinary expenses including spay/neuter, microchip and vaccinations.\n\nWish Upon a Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit, foster based animal rescue. If you would like to meet\tLouie, please complete our adoption questionnaire at www.wishuponarescue.org/adopt. We will review your responses and be in contact to schedule a meet and greet at a time and place convenient for your family and our team members.\n",

            "description": "Jethro is just over a year old and 50 pounds. He's a bully mix and absolute lover! He likes to play after eating and loves tug-of-war and fetch (although he doesn't always give the ball back). He is quite chatty when he wants to play.. he'll let you know exactly when it's time for you to throw the ball. He also gets the zoomies when he first goes outside and boy is he fast.\n\nJethro knows basic commands (sit, stay, down, paw) and he also knows \"watch me\". We use this on walks a lot. He walks well on a leash but sometimes gets excited when he sees lizards and other people walking. He is good with other dogs but doesn't understand that cats are friends. He's also crate trained and potty trained. Ok with older kids and no smaller dogs, needs dogs his size.\n\nAdoption fee includes DHPP vaccine, Rabies vaccine (if age appropriate) heartworm testing, spay/neuter surgery, deworming, wellness vet visit, one month of pet insurance and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application at https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/ if you would like to adopt or meet this dog, and we will be in touch right away!",

If you would like to try a Foster to Adopt trial, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nIf you are only interested in temporarily Fostering one of our rescues, please fill out a Foster Application.\n\nMeet Marley (fka Eddie)!Marley (fka Eddie) was adopted from ARWOB in October 2019. Sadly he needs to be relinquished back to ARWOB. We received detailed information from his previous adopter about some of his challenges and as such, we are looking for the RIGHT match for Marley. Therefore, please read his biography thoroughly and if you believe he would be a good match, you are welcome to consider a foster-to-adopt trial before finalizing his adoption.NOTE: We are looking for the right temporary foster home for him ASAP and would love to have him situated as soon as 1/20/21. All foster supplies are provided by ARWOB. His previous owner was not interested in crate training, but he was crate trained when in foster care with ARWOB in 2019. We can provide his new foster family with a crate for him, but we do know he is house trained and does not necessarily need a crate. It would be up to the new foster if they would like to use one. Marley will need to be in a home with NO dogs. If the home has cats, he must be supervised when around them and not left alone as a precaution. Marley's development with his previous owner is not clear, but we believe there was a lack of leadership and training. Unfortunately, his previous owner also became physically unable to handle a large breed dog. We are waiting for more information about Marley and have requested videos, but as a foster you will have access to a behaviorist to work with Marley. This would require the foster to drive to Carmel Valley likely once a month to meet with the trainer and/or do Zoom meetings for ongoing sessions. Marley will need to work on his leash walking/reactivity and quickly corrected when he comes into the presence of other dogs. If you have any additional questions, please email us at animalrescuers@sbcglobal.net. However, the first step in the process would be to submit an online application through our website. If you would like to ONLY foster Marley, please complete an online foster application. If you are interested in foster-to-adopt or adopting immediately, please complete an online adoption application. These applications can be found at: https://www.arwob.org/forms/ORIGINAL RESCUE STORY:Meet adorable Eddie! First thing that comes to mind when you meet Eddie is Teddie Bear! He is a large boy with a big heart. He was pulled from a high kill shelter in Ensenada just as he was ready to be euthanized. He was fostered by his rescuer in Ensenada for a month. She has 2 dogs his size and he did well with them. She would also take him to work and he would hang out in her cubicle and he did great. He is not a big leash puller and tends to walk next to you. We do not know how he will be around with cats. He is a great dog and he has been learning to play fetch with a tennis ball and frisbee. There are many things he has not been exposed to and we would love an adopter who can show him the ropes. As always, dog training will be a must, especially for larger breeds.If you would like to meet one of our animals, PLEASE fill out an adoption application.\n\nDog Adoption Application\n\nCat Adoption Application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nIF YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY\nplease fill out a short questionnaire in addition to the adoption application.\n\nMilitary Questionnaire\n\n1/31/21 2:30 AM",

            "description": "Hi there everybody! My name is Zeus! I\u2019m 8 months old, about thirty pounds, and I am just learning what it means to be a pup. When I hear \u2018good boy\u2019 I get so excited I can hardly control my wiggly zoomy body!!! It\u2019s so fun to learn new things! \nI had a bit of a rough start down south, but since I moved to Wisconsin I\u2019ve learned that I love the snow, I love to play, and I LOVE to cuddle. If I could be attached to my foster mom all the time, life would be perfect. \nI\u2019m still learning how to walk calmly on a leash and how to greet new friends without being too excited. Don\u2019t worry though, I know lots of good stuff! I potty outside, I know how how to sleep quietly in my crate when you leave, I can spin, sit, lay down, shake, come, wait, and I\u2019m pretty sure I know what \u2018off\u2019 means sometimes....\nI think new people are a bit scary, and I would do better in a house that doesn\u2019t have lots of friends over all the time. Once we are friends though, man do I adore you. I love other dogs, but low-energy dogs might not be a big fan of all my jumping and running. I think I would love the energy of kids, but I get so excited and love to jump up and say hello- so smaller kiddos might not be a fan. \nOverall, I\u2019m looking for a calm home where I can play play play and then snore around for a bit. I\u2019d love to show you my tricks and learn some more, and I\u2019d love to be allowed to sit with you on the couch and play with you in the snow. I will need lots of good structure, and a human who is willing to help me keep learning. Does this sound like you? If you think we could be Furever friends, let\u2019s meet. I\u2019m wiggly all over just thinking about it!\nZeus is fostering in Cudahy, WI.  To apply, please go to www.ruffluckdogrescue.com.",

To have your home considered for adoption, read about our adoption process or fees, and find out about interstate transport, please visit our website, www.LongWayHomeAdoptables.org and click the adopt tab!\n\nOur adoption fee is $200 for dogs, $100 for cats, and it includes spay/neuter, all vaccines, heartworm testing, fecal testing, deworming, flea/heartworm prevention, and a microchip. \n\nNATIONWIDE TRANSPORT available for an additional $200 fee. See our website for more info!\n\nPlease note: breed listings are based on educated guesses. Shelter animals and abused pets do not come with DNA profiles, so breeds listed on the profile are based on size, coat, markings, and body shape, but are in no way guaranteed. \n\n_______\n\nLong Way Home is a volunteer organization, comprised of a network of foster homes.

According to owner Neena is housetrained, sweet and friendly. loves to ride in a car. Neena loves to lay on the sofa and when let out will return on recall. Owner said she did have 1 littler of pups this past Nov.  She will be spayed upon adoption so that there are no more litters. Neena has not shown  aggression to other shelter dogs thus far and has been around other dogs while in her previous home. For any meet and greets, we recommend potential adopters bring their dog to test with Neena.She will make someone a great companion. Shelter will be taking applications, checking vet references and will want to do more about home environment of potential adopters.

            "description": "This sweet boy is Sterling.  He is a 2 year old German Shepherd mix who weighs 46 lbs but should be more like 65 lbs.  Sterling was found on the street extremely underweight.  He has gained a few pounds in his foster home but needs to gain a lot more weight. Despite being a stray who was hungry and lonely, he has fallen in love with his foster humans and their dogs immediately and have quickly picked up potty training and crate training.\n\nSterling is a big lovable goofball who has lots of energy. He plays hard and loves hard. Sterling loves to run and play chase with his foster dog brother.  He loves snuggling on the couch with you and would also love sleeping in your bed snuggled up next to you if you'll let him. He is loyal to and protective of his people and definitely wouldn't let any pesky squirrels sneak into your backyard.  \n\nBecause he was such a hungry boy,  he can be protective of his food and sometimes of toys.  Therefore, he likes to eat his food in the safety of his crate and chew his most favorite toys in his crate.  The first couple of days he would defend his belongings from the other dogs and his foster parents but with a little bit of reassurance and trading he no longer guards his things.  \n\nIn his forever home, Sterling will need another very playful dog and a fenced yard.  He will need a 6ft fence as he would easily jump a shorter fence.  Because of his resource guarding, we would prefer he be in a home with older kids (16 and up).  \n\nSterling is leash trained, crate trained, mostly house trained if taken out every hour for right now.  HIs foster mom says he walks perfect on a leash and doesn't pull or drag her along. He sleeps well all night long in his crate, but come 6:00 AM he is ready for breakfast. \n\nSterling is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Sterling and make him a part of your family, please apply at FYDRadopt.com!",

Poor Brody was languishing in a kill shelter suffering from a painful skin infection and he was severely emaciated. As soon as we heard about Brody, we immediately scooped him out of there and brought him to our veterinary partner for medical treatment. Brody is now being pampered and loved and he will soon be ready to take his place in his forever family! Brody is a super-friendly pup who loves everyone. If you would like Brody to join your family, please apply online to adopt Brody at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

It doesn't last long but it sure is cute to watch!\n\nIf you're looking for a super low-maintenance pup that loves naps and cuddles, then look no further! This short and stout lady has proved to be the perfect houseguest in her foster home. Princess greets you with the biggest smile when you get home, but until then this sweet potato happily spends her day lounging and napping. Being the proper princess that she is, Princess has no interest in chewing up anything she shouldn't.\n\nWhile she prefers spooning with her person at night, she's also content to sleep on her own bed. As long as Princess's close to her people, she's a happy little girl! Napping isn't her only hobby though. Princess also loves the great outdoors and while out on walks, her tail never stops wagging, regularly looking back at her human with that big smile on her face, snorting and snuffling with glee.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $100.00\n\nAdoption Criteria:\n- Keep mentally & physically active\n- No children under the age of 12\n- I am not an apartment dog\n- Single family home is a must\n- please No doggy siblings\n- I am not a dog park dog\n__________________________________________\n\nDue to COVID-19, adoptions are by appointment only.

At SDHS:Moose has been microchipped, neutered, and is up to date on vaccinations. Our medical team also removed several masses with mostly complete excision. They would like to speak with you prior to adoption of Moose in order to answer any questions you may have! Why this pet is the one for you:Moose is a sweet, chonky pittie boy looking for a loving home to call his own! He arrived in care as a stray, so we are still getting to know him, but so far he's been a darling. Sometimes when he gets excited meeting new people, Moose can enthusiastically jump up to greet them. With his considerable weight and excitement about life, Moose pulls a little on leash. His adopters should be prepared to walk him on a front-clipping harness and continue his positive reinforcement training. Does Moose sound like the pup for you? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started!\n\n\n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: Black Weight: 70.5lbs Age: 5yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Mason is 4 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. Mason is good with people and other dogs. We found Mason in a kill shelter where he was brought in in a completely emaciated condition. This poor boy was starving to death. We busted Mason out of there, brought him to our vet and now he is safely working his way up to his ideal weight. Mason is a super cute, sweet, friendly boy who can't wait to put the first 4 months of his life behind him and start the rest of his life. And this time that life will be happy. If you would like to be the happy in the rest of Mason's life, please apply online to adopt Mason (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

When his owners could not be found, they contacted Doberman Underground to ensure that he would find the perfect forever home.\n\nDasher is a handsome boy, about 7 years old. He's a laid back boy with great house manners who will be happy to be an only dog where he gets all the attention. He would also do well with a large, calm older dog with a slow introduction. He doesn't like small dogs and no cats. Kids over 13 would be okay. He takes an inexpensive thyroid medicine to keep him healthy.\n\nDasher crates well and just loves his dog beds, however he is getting very used to curling up on the couch with his foster parents\n\nHe is ready to find his forever family now. Is it yours?

She is just under a year old, weighs 48 pounds, and she sports a pretty black tri coat and a full tail.  Fran is housebroken, crate-trained and knows some basic obedience commands.  She walks nicely on leash and does well in the car.\nFran can be a bit shy at the first meeting, but she does love people!  She is a high Velcro, lower energy girl who loves to be wherever her people are.  Walks are fun, and so is hanging out watching TV or just napping in the sun.  Fran also enjoys the company of other dogs, and she is always up for a fun romp in the yard.  Fran has not been cat-tested.\nThe ideal home for Fran is friendly and laid back, shared with a family who is looking for a happy, easy-going young girl to share in their adventures.  A fenced yard is important, another dog or dogs is fine with her, and children over the age of 10 are welcome.  If you are the right family for this great young girl, apply today!  Fran is fostered in Columbus, GA.\n",

Unfortunately, things aren't progressing like they had hoped and caring for him properly has become a challenge. Murray struggles with change - trips to the vet, car rides, visitors, baths - and it's tough to keep things consistent and change free with kids in the home. So Murray has rejoined the AAVA family. Murray would do best in an older, calm household with a consistent routine. Murray loves, and thrives, outdoors so a home with a fenced back yard, maybe even a dog door, would be ideal. Murray has a bit of a prey drive so no cats, chickens, or other small animals is recommended. Murray also loves other dogs; he does better with a calm, confident friend. We know their is a home out there for Murray! Is that you?",

When no one came to claim her, we took her and she went right to a wonderful foster home where we have been able to address several issues.\n\nHer x-rays show that she has a bad hip and arthritis in her other legs. We have her on pain meds, which has greatly helped her mobility, but she still needs a little help sometimes. She also has heartworms, which makes her breathing a little labored at times. We have an easy heartworm protocol and she should do fine with it. She also had some head tremors when she came in and had a seizure a couple of weeks ago, but meds seem to have stopped that. Geraldine has a myriad of issues, but she has made herself at home with the foster and all of her dogs. She seems to really enjoy her time with the foster and will sometimes bark softly at her when she wants some company. She is a total sweetheart and we would love to find a quiet home for her where she can get caught up on all of the love and attention that she seems to have missed in her life. Were not sure how long she has got, but we will keep her as a foster and cover the vetting if someone will just LOVE her. If you have a quiet home and would like to help this deserving girl, please email info@atlantalabrescue.com.",

I have lots of energy and love to play! Including my patented zoomies, I love to play with frisbees and tennis balls and also enjoy playing with my foster fur sibling!\n\nI am almost 100% house trained and am nearly crate trained! I am still working on enjoying my crate time, but knowing I will get lots of playtime afterwards helps the time pass by quickly! I do well with other dogs who can match my energy and understand I am a rambunctious, clumsy girl who is happy to have a buddy! I have not met any cats. After a good play session, I especially enjoy a good snuggle and nap! I am leash trained and enjoy taking walks around the neighborhood!\n\nI would fit in best with an active family that can take me on fun walks, challenge me mentally, and take me on adventures!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the adorable, Brita, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee: $250\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older\nChildren must be 5 years old or older",

            "description": "1220606 - Hi! My name is Ferris and Im a very special little guy looking for a very special family. Im a 10 months old and 12 pounds chiweenie mix from Texas.\n\nWhen I first arrived to my foster home I was very territorial. I finally started relaxing after a week there. I specially enjoy being around my foster mom and dad, their kids stress me out because they are kind of loud so I would definitely do best in a house without kids. I love their dog (a super friendly male Russell terrier mix), hes my best friend and we play together all the time! But I can be mean the other dog (a little Chihuahua puppy) even though we were together at the shelter, and I'm not a fan of the cat. Im getting a lot better at hanging out with all of them, though. Socializing has certainly helped me improve my behavior, but I amy be best as an only dog or at least I shouldn't be with dogs smaller than me.\n\nI am very sweet when I feel safe and relaxed. I love to cuddle and give kisses. Im an active puppy so I love to chew on my toys, play and go on walks. Im getting really good at walking on the leash!\n\nIm almost fully potty trained and as long as yiu take me out every 4 hours during the day I have no accidents in the house. \n\nIm looking for a forever family who has the time and kind heart to keep training me. Itd be easier for me to adapt to a family with no kids, no other dogs and no cats. I like to have all the attention! But I also need someone who can teach me to socialize little by little. Itd be really helpful if my new family could take me to a Puppy Training. Im really smart and willing to learn good manners, I just need love and patience to be able to do it!\n\nIf youd like to meet me and are ready to have me in your family for the next 15 years or so, please fill an application at www.sloppykisses.org/adoptions! Ill give you my unconditional love and company in return.",

Fawn is still adapting to her new Colorado environment, so she is a bit shy, but when you go on walks she stays close by and occasionally looks back to make sure you're keeping up! She's an only-pup in my home with no kids around but she's curious and during her temp test she eagerly approached other dogs to play. Fawn is half way through her heartworm meds, but she'll be ready for a relaxed home soon enough as she seems to be a very chill dog and comfortable hanging out in her favorite chair, with her blanket and dinosaur, while you work.\n\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\t3 Puppy combo shots (Distemper/Parvo)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicro-chip\n\tRabies\n\tDe-worming",

I love lounging on the couch and watching tv. If Im not getting enough attention I like to get really close and then paw you for pets. I love playing and chasing my fur siblings around in the backyard and playing tug of war with toys. I am very well behaved and learning my basic commands like sit and stay. Sometimes when I get really excited I do little bunny hops and make cute grunting noises. I am good in a crate and dont even make any noise when Im in there. I cant wait to meet my forever family! \n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\t3 Puppy combo shots (Distemper/Parvo)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicro-chip\n\tRabies\n\tDe-worming",

He happens to also be deaf. Knowing he was shelter bound I'm his owner reached out for help. The situation was super sad being that Haskell also lost his brother and littermate to a inoperable tumor. His owner, a young mom of a young child, was facing losing her home if he didn't leave as the landlord changed his mind on having pets. A mutual friend posted his story and we watched to see if any would take. Unfortunately with Bull Terriers being frequently surrendered most breed specific rescues can't afford to take mixes. His future wasn't looking very bright and knowing he was deaf he wouldn't likely make it out of a shelter situation. He has an amazing foster who reached out and offered to help so we stepped up and he arrived to her Monday. He was fully vetted yesteday and it was confirmed he was deaf. He is doing awesome with his 6 foster siblings and we will be working on teaching him signs so that he has the best chance of success in the future. \n\nWe would really like Haskell to go to a home with Bull Terrier experience as well as hearing impaired experience. We realize this may be hard to find so we are hoping to at least find someone with experience with hearing impaired dogs. \n\n $250.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible.

The family has eight children so Buddy is great with kids and earned his name as he was the kid's \"Buddy\". This handsome boy used to live inside but as the family grew they didn't have room for him indoors so he spends his days out in his dirt yard. The family says he prefers to be outdoor - who knows? They tell us he is a white german shepherd mix who does great with their small livestock incuding lambs, goats, and even chickens. Good with dogs too but oddly he does not like cats. Buddy weighs around 100 lbs according to his family. Buddy is accustomed to eating his meals alone and undisturbed so we recommend continuing that practice at least for some time. We will arrange a ride for this gentle fellow if you are interested in adopting. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $200 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

            "description": "We just cant believe this sweet boy hasnt been snatched up yet! Frankie (male) is a fun, snuggly, goofy, smart 2 year old best guess pointer/pittie mix. He is a young boy and still has plenty of energy, but he also thoroughly enjoys his cuddle sessions when playtime is done. He weighs around 60lbs and does well with other dogs of all sizes...but he does like to play pretty rough and tumble, so another dog his size (or larger) in the home would be best. It is currently unknown how he does with cats. Frankie ADORES people! He does tend to get excitable and can be mouthy during playtime (note: he is never mean, just overly playful), so we would recommend a home with older children (at least 12+) and a family who can continue to work with him on his training, manners, and understanding his boundaries. He also gets very excited at his meal times (to be fair, dont we all?!), so a slow-feeder bowl would be a good investment. Frankies foster family says he is a smart boy and a quick learner; he knows how to sit, shake, and lay down, and is working on how to stay and high five. He is fully potty-trained (no accidents at all!) and crate-trained. He is a social boy and would make someone an awesome walking, running, or hiking buddy. He cant wait to find his forever person/family. Please share this handsome boys face far and wide so Frankie can find the happily ever after hes been searching for! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Frankie, please submit a general adoption application at https://newleashdogrescue.com (or private message us if youre already preapproved!). \n\n**Frankies $200 adoption fee includes his neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test, and microchip.",

            "description": "This is Claire, a beautiful 1-2 year old, 35lb, Springer Spaniel Mix. Claire came to Heartland very afraid and very broken. Somewhere in her past, she has been severely traumatized by unknown sources and because of this, she is very slow to trust her surroundings and the people handling her. Claire's potential adopter must understand that she still needs a lot of work, training and dedication to help her though this recovery period. \nDespite her traumatic past, Claire has shown her foster mom that with a large amount of patience, understanding and time, she is full of love and thoroughly enjoys being loved on once she has begun to trust you. It took roughly TWO MONTHS for her foster mom to gain her trust and start to see the darling dog Claire has the potential to be. She does well in a crate, she prefers it to being out at first. Claire currently does not do well in cars. She may urinate, defecate or vomit out of fear while in them. She is not comfortable with leashes and will need a dedicated human to gently train her to be leashed. The perfect forever home for Claire would be Local to northern Indiana to reduce travel anxiety, full of patience, have a calm and encouraging environment where she can learn to trust at her own pace without fear of negative reinforcement or stern punishment and her humans understand that this gentle girl needs A LOT of time to adjust and feel comfortable. She may not let you pet her until she trusts you but doesn't mind if you're nearby with some tasty treats! She does well with other gentle and playful dogs and will follow their lead. Claire would do best in a home with no small children or children that can be relatively relaxed and quiet while she is figuring out if she is safe or not. She needs a safe quiet place to retreat when afraid such as a covered crate, under a bed or her own room. Claire does require 2 medications daily for life for her anxiety costly roughly $65.00 a month. A yard with a physical fence is also a requirement at this time. If you think you have the dedication and heart to let this beautiful dog learn to love you, it will be worth the potentially long wait!\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

He came to us quite terrified but he's is getting better with time.  We've noticed some quirks with this cutie. He does not like children, takes a few times being with a person before he will open up to them, and he's nervous while walking on a leash, so he needs a good collar and harness for walking. Due to the fear issues, we are requiring a physically fenced in yard for this gentleman. If you would like to meet him, please fill out an application today! Please note this guy is going to need you to come for at least three visits for him to feel comfortable. \n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

I am tolerating my foster mom flopping them around saying they are the \u201ccutest baby ears ever.\u201d  Insert eye roll here. \n\nI actually think of myself as a tall hunky boy in search of a forever home.\n\nI came to the rescue as a pup with my siblings and found myself back in the loving arms of the caregivers at BCRR, in the North Eastern part of the Dallas area. \n\nIf you question the border collie in my lineage, my sister had her DNA tested and came back dutch shepherd, border collie, lab and others. \n\nI am a curious neutered boy of 2 years, approximately 60lbs, house trained, and crate trained. I was not tested with children but am well behaved with cats and other dogs. I love a good run and seek a spacious backyard to romp and play. I know a few tricks and am very food motivated. I learn quickly and hope to find an assertive dog savvy human to call my companion! \n\nDue to my size, I don't believe I'd be good in an apartment setting. If you think you fit the bill of my dream forever home, please send in an application! How can you say no to this mug!?",

I carry my ball around with me the entire time I'm outside. I'm a power chewer for sure, so I'll need my toy bin to always be fully stocked!\n\nI love to be outside with my humans. I'm a pretty chill girl and prefer to hang out and relax on the patio with you instead of going for walks. I don't mind being around other dogs, but I haven't played with my foster brothers very much.\n\nI haven't been around cats or kids yet, but I'm low energy and don't jump so I shouldn't have any issues with them. I know all of my basic commands and go into my crate very easily... as long as I get a treat afterwards!\n\nMy perfect day looks something like this: fetch, eat, sleep, repeat. Does this sound like your family's lifestyle, too? Apply to meet me!",

            "description": "Linus in search of a new home through no fault of his own.  His people split up and the parent he stayed with was irresponsible and did not take care of him. Linus is a beautiful boy who was born in March of 2018.  He is housetrained, gets along with other dogs,  and loves human attention.  He is unproven with cats, as the only cat he knew was an outside cat and did not enter his space. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nLinus will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

            "description": "*****Belgian Malinois Adoption requirements*****\n\nThe dog you have selected is a Belgian Malinois.  This is a breed that has very specific needs for an adoptive home.  Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  \n\nMeet beautiful Sarah!\n\nSarah loves playing with large dogs and enjoys chasing them. She is always happy and eager to please, but can also be a bit timid, submissive and a complete follower. Because she is so eager to please, she will learn very quickly. Sarah is about 3 years old.\n\nBeing a malinois, she would definitely benefit from other large dog(s) to keep her mind and body occupied, or lots of people activity, or she may resort to destructive behaviors if she's not mentally and physically challenged. Sarah is crate trained, as well, and loves playing with toys.\n\nIf you can give Sarah an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organziation.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving a life!",

I first want to share with you that I recently found out I have a collapsing trachea, which can be easily managed with continuous medication, and bladder stones that will eventually need to be removed if they start to bother me\u2026 much like children. I certainly don\u2019t mind other dogs but, you know, I really hate children. I would prefer to be in an adult-only household. I may be a little bit guarded when we first meet, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to be very good friends! I don\u2019t necessarily need a fenced-in yard since I am a master in the art of leash walking, but it may help to perfect my house training. I am also crate trained and come when called.\n\nIf you think we could be a good, pure-blooded family, then submit an adoption application for me, Dolores!\n\nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nApply to adopt Dolores here:  https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AGAR/Dog\n\n\u2022 \u2022 At this time we are only adopting in the state of TN due to CDC recommended travel restrictions involving COVID19 ? Applicants personal pets must be current on vaccines & heartworm/flea prevention and be altered ? All applicants are subject to a thorough screening process \u2022 \u2022",

My name is Bert and I am a fixed, 2 year old male and approximately 60lbs. I came into the Rescue with my littermates and was fortunately enough to follow my brother, Ernie, into my previous home and now and into my foster parents' care.\u00a0\n\nBut let's not dwell on the past!\u00a0\n\nI am a fun loving, easy going guy who thoroughly enjoys taking up space on a couch.\u00a0\n\nFeet cold? No issue. I'm actually a lap dog. Too big? No, never. Just think of me as a space heater! Full body pillow! Your best companion ever! I am super smart, house trained and crate trained.\n\nIf you doubt my border collie heritage, just ask\u00a0 my sister!

We have not had him around kids but his prior owner reports he is kid friendly as well.\nHe would love a dog more his size and age to roughhouse with, he is always ready for play and isn\u2019t aggressive towards other dogs.\n\nRJ lived with a kitty and 2 Chihuahuas previously, but the foster\u2019s and neighbor\u2019s outside cats are very INTERESTING and seem tasty.\nHe really tries to reach them and will circle back until the kitty is out of sight.\n\nHe is house trained and crate trained.\n\nRJ does bark at things outside and likes to run window to window or room to room for a better look.\nRJ needs toys, he loves nylabones and strong rubber balls. \u00a0He will do his best to catch anything thrown towards him and will fetch, but doesn\u2019t understand if he drops it, you will throw it again.\n\nRJ is a strong puller and needs someone with a STRONG arm. HE also requires good fencing. \u00a0The foster has 4 board wood fencing, but if the gap is enough he will try to go under.\n\nIf you have a good fence and no cats, RJ would be a great pup for you!\n\nAll of our dogs are in foster homes and are available to meet by appointment only and only after an application has been completed.

After getting off to a rough start in an environment of abuse & neglect, I was rescued a year ago and have been enjoying the good life. I love to have fun and be silly. When I am not chasing tennis balls and frisbees, I enjoy belly rubs and naps in front of the front door. I love playing with my humans and never tire of learning new games. I am very smart and pick up quickly on the things that please the humans in my life. I am housebroken and careful with things inside the house but am not fond of other dogs or cats. I also walk great on a leash and love to hike and jog. I am eager to please - I just need the right person to have patience with my anxiety towards other animals and humans that I don't know well.\n\nPlease contact Quentin Estime at 323-327-8391 or dedheh489@gmail.com\n\nThese dogs are looking for homes through private parties in the Los Angeles CA area.

It appears he hasn't had many opportunities to play so he will need a family to help him learn to trust and how to play.  \n\nIt appears that his front right leg was broken at one time and healed on its own. He does not seemed bothered by it and walks just fine.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this adorable canine, please FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION on our website www.safehavenforpets.org.

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull/Labrador Retriever mix\nSex: Female\nAge: Between 5 and 6 years old\nWeight: Approx. 60 lbs.\nColoring: Gray brindle with white chest and paws\nSpayed: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\nShots Up to Date: Yes\nHouse Broken: Yes\nKennel Trained: Yes\nLeash Trained: Yes\nFood Aggression: None\n\nActivity Level: Moderate. River is happy to snooze the day away on a couch or in a dog bed, but the moment you grab the leash, she's ready to go! She is accustomed to being in an enclosed yard during the day while her owners are at work and sleeping in a kennel at night.\n\nAdults: River loves people and has never met a stranger. She likes to press herself against people's legs and wag her tail so hard her whole back end wiggles. She is well-mannered and never gets \"mouthy\" or jumps up, no matter how excited she may be. She also hardly ever barks - she prefers to snort, cuff, and chortle.\n\nChildren: River currently lives in a house with a baby and has spent time with toddlers. She is very patient with children and has never snapped or growled at them. If a child is rough or overly attentive, she moves away or (if the child is persistent) retreats to a different room.\n\nOther Dogs: River does not tolerate other dogs well - I suspect due to bad experiences as a puppy or during her time on the streets. She would do best as the single dog in a household.\n\nCats: River has an active prey drive and views small animals as something to chase and catch. She would do best in a household without cats.\n\n\nIf interested in River please email her mom to katherine.a.mcmillen@gmail.com\n\nRiver is located in Texas but can be adopted out of state.",

            "description": "A GENTLE COMPANION AWAITS YOU:  9 years old / 55 lbs. and needs to gain a little more weight.\n\nHello, my name is Conner.  When I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control, I was in rough shape \u2013 very thin, with infected skin and fur loss - from long term neglect.  With great vet care and lots of love in my foster home, I have already gained over 10 lbs.  and my fur is coming back in.  I still have a way to go, though I am filling out and healing more each day \u2013 ready to meet my new family!    \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  There are two friendly dogs in my foster home who greeted me nicely when I arrived and \u2013 though I was initially scared, I have come out of my shell and get along famously with both now.  So, if you have a nice gentle doggie at home already, let\u2019s meet / Cat\u2019s unknown / I met kids once in my foster home, and I did enjoy them.  They were very sweet and gentle with me and I with them. I was especially fond of the little girl wanting to spend lots of time with her. They were 6 and 8 years old - so calm children this age or older could be a good fit in my new home, let\u2019s meet and see!  \n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  My foster describes me as the \u2018epitome of a Velcro dog\u2026 but in a good way\u2019.  I respond to love and kindness and want to be with my people.  I am a curious guy who always wants to know what my people are up to.  I even brave the vacuum cleaner to follow my foster mom as she vacuums.  She says it is as if I am watching over her.  I wait patiently as she goes up and down the stairs to let me outside.  So sweet!  I have such a kind nature; my foster says that whoever adopts me is going to be very happy.  How about that! / My energy level is 3-5.  \n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am well-behaved, and I will come when my foster mom calls me.  She is working on other commands with me, and \u2013 since I take treats graciously and gently - I bet you can too / I don\u2019t need a crate in my foster home, as my doggie bed is my safe place / I have good potty habits in my foster home \u2013 giving signals like pacing around and going to the door when I need a potty break.   I also understand the phrase \u2018gotta go potty?\u201d\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I enjoy being out in the yard with my people and like to explore and wander around (though I am always keeping my foster mom in sight) / I can\u2019t think of any dislikes, though I need a few minutes to get used to new folks.  I have suffered from neglect in the past, so I would not be happy if I did not get the love, good care and attention all doggies deserve!\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered.  I am continuing medicated baths 2/week to help my skin heal and my fur to continue to grow back in and these can be done in my new home. \n\nI am looking to add lots of love to my new home with a wonderful family!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

            "description": "Meet Bailey! \n2-3 year old female Shiba Inu/Doxie mix (that\u2019s our best guess)\nThe sweet loving girl gets the worlds best mom award. She delivered 6 puppies back in September and was so devoted them. \nSadly her family at the time was not as devoted and they dumped her and her 6 puppies at the shelter. \n\nConfused and hurt by this upheaval, Bailey found herself in a new foster home. A home that wanted to take care of her and her pups. Took a few days for Bailey to come around and understand that not all people are bad, not all people will abandon you!\n\nBailey is a love! She\u2019s a lap dog, who likes to sleep under the covers with you. She\u2019ll nuzzle her way under the blankets and warm you all night long. \nShe\u2019s great with other dogs, and cats!\n\nBecause of what Bailey has gone through, she is very nervous around strangers and new situations. With all the COVID precautions, we have not been able to work with her on socializing with new people as much as we would like to. \nShe has visited the dog park and is slowly venturing out, but mainly just likes to stay right by your side. She had the chance to visit a family members house and she was visibly scared (shaking) at first, but thankfully she was able to start making herself feel like home after a short time. \n\nBailey\u2019s potential adopter will understand that she will need a little time to warm up to her new home, but we believe that due to her need and want for human affection, that won\u2019t take long at all! \n\nAll potential adopters are expected to complete an application and provide pictures of their yard, patio, and/or balcony making sure we can see the fence line and/or railing.  The application can be completed and submitted from our website - throwmeabonedogrescue.org - the link is found of the Adoption Process page.  Applications will be reviewed for approval before setting an appointment to come meet and possibly adopt the dog of interest.  In addition, those who live in a rental property are expected to provide proof that they are allowed to have a dog where they live.\n\nEach of our rescued dogs has been de-wormed if necessary, de-flea'd (with topical treatment if old enough, and by medicated bath if too young), spayed/neutered, microchipped, is up to date on shots, and has been fully examined by a veterinarian.  In addition, each adopted dog comes with a starter baggie of the food it has been eating, a few treats for training purposes, a rawhide chew, a lead and collar, and a folder containing pertinent records.",

Lily is great with kids and male dogs, but she does not get along with female dogs.  She will need a home where she is the only female dog.  She is house trained and kennel trained.  Lily likes to be petted, to have her belly rubbed, and to sunbathe in the backyard.  She likes to play with toys and she loves her dog bed.  She does not bark or whine.  She dislikes snuggling right next to you, but she still likes to be on the couch or bed with you.  She is up to date on all her shots.  Please contact Emily if interested in her please email her mom to \n\nLane.Emily0@gmail.com\n\nThis girl is located in Texas but can be transported out of state.",

Some stairs are difficult for her to manage, others are not, she may just be stubborn. Dusti is a small cuddly lap dog in a large dog body. She has adjusted to a cat in her foster home, but is still curious. She has shown resource guarding with other dogs, specifically when her human is eating and more mildly with human attention. Ideally, she'd like to be the only dog and get all the attention. Dusti does well in a crate, but it may not be needed since she seems house broken and has not shown any signs of being destructive. Dusti is a sweet cuddle bug, however, she snores!. If she sounds like your gal, put in your application and she'll be happy to schedule time to meet you.",

This boy weights 60 pounds, he is timid around other animals at first but takes very little time to warm up to them. Within a few minutes he\u2019s playing with them.  He\u2019s also extremely energetic and loves to play!! He will play for as long as you can hang with him! He\u2019s very sweet and just wants his head scratched all the time.

            "description": "Meet Savannah, a 1 yr old dalmatian or pointer mix female who was turned into the shelter in Coachella Valley, Riverside County, with her sister, Juno.  She is a friendly lively pup, LOVES to play with other dogs and is enjoying her daily walks.  She was shy when she first came to us but is loving all of the daily activity now. She has not had any training but is smart and can learn whatever is needed.  We are looking for experienced dog owners for this busy girl and a home with another young dog or two she can play and snuggle with.  She can go home with her sister, Juno, but if not, MUST go to a home with another young playful dog.  She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped and is ready to go home anytime to the right home.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Savannah, are not a novice dog owner and have another young dog or two, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email to dalrescue@sbcglobal.net and request an adoption questionnaire.  You should also be able to access the questionnaire on line from our website homepage, www.dalrescuesocal.com.  Once the completed questionnaire is returned, and if it looks like Savannah might be a good fit for you and your family, arrangements can be quickly made for you all to come meet Savannah at the kennel where she lives.  She is loving life now but will surely blossom with a loving attentive family and another k9 buddy to play with.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love seeing posts and photos of life with your spotty friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!",

Bailey Boo is good with kids, cats and other dogs. She\u2019s working on house training, basic commands and her puppy manners. \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

He spent the first few months of his life without getting any love from people. He is a shy pup and because new sights and sounds can be scary, slow exposure to new things has been good for him. Zorro has taken a few car rides and done pretty well and he enjoys stops to eat a Hardees hamburger. Zorro appears to be a boxer mix and is a year old with a birth date of 11/12/19. He is neutered, up to date on shots, and healthy. Zorro needs a calm environment to build trust and gain confidence. We are looking for a home, possibly with a well-adjusted dog, that can work with him and help to expand his world.\n***************************************************************************\nThis pet comes with an implanted 24 PetWatch microchip and free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service. \n***************************************************************************\nThis dog is available for adoption at the Humane Society of McCormick County for an adoption fee. All of our dogs are indoor dogs with outdoor privileges. To adopt, contact 864-391-2349 or HSMC2000@gmail.com. We are an all-volunteer 501c3 organization.

Ella is a dog reactive so she will do better in a home with no dogs and preferably someone with experience. Ella loves being next to humans. If you are looking for a dog to snuggle with please consider adopting Ella. This sweet girl is also great with kids and totally adores them. Ella has suffered a lot and she deserves a great family to love her forever. This beauty will do best in a home with a yard . We are sure she will make her family very happy.\n\nElla is located in Texas but can be transported out of state.\n\nIf interested in Ella please visit our website www.bravebullyrescue.org and fill out our adoption application\n",

I get a little too excited sometimes, but you just have to tell me to calm down and I'm all good. I'm always down to try new things. I'm quite the photogenic dude; it's just so easy when you're this handsome. I really like to be outside, but a night cuddled up on the couch sounds pretty nice, too. Anywhere I can be with you sounds perfect! Thanks for checking in! Due to the Covid-19 virus pandemic, our offices are operating differently than normal.

He will very gently lay his big head on your lap so that you can pet him easier. The best thing for him would be to get out of the shelter to relax and come out of his shell.",

            "description": "Meet Juno, a 1 yr old dalmatian or pointer mix female rescued with her sister, Savannah from the Coachella Valley Animal Shelter in Riverside County.  She is a friendly girl, active and loves to play with other dogs.  She has not had any training but is smart and can quickly learn whatever is needed. She was shy when she first came in but is enjoying her new 2 legged and 4 legged friends.  We are looking for a home with another young dog or two Juno can play and snuggle with.  She can go home with her sister but if not, a friendly playful dog in the home with her is a MUST.  She is a busy dog and should go home with experienced dog owners. Given her breed and age, she will need a fair amount of exercise daily to keep happy and healthy.  She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped and ready to go home anytime to the right home and family.  Perhaps it will be your's.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Juno, are not a novice dog owner and have another young dog or two, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email at dalrescue@sbcglobal.net and request an adoption application.  You should also be able to access the application on line from our website homepage, www.dalrescuesocal.com.  Once we get back the completed application, and if it looks like Juno might be a good fit for you and your family, arrangements can be quickly made for you all to come with your other dog(s) to meet Juno at the kennel where she lives.  She is enjoying the constant playtime with her new k9 buddies but would surely blossom in a new home with a family to love.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love reading stories and seeing photos of life with your spotty friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!",

            "description": "#710978Age: 6 yearsWeight: 50 lbs How this pet arrived:This pet was rescued by the Humane Law Enforcement Team on December 27, 2020. Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Wallace! Aren't those floppy ears just the cutest? Since Wallace came to us, we have seen that he is reluctant to walk on a leash, but LOVES food and treats and can be persuaded to keep going! Give this guy a dog-cookie or two and you'll have his attention. He also has quite the voice and makes a lot of grumbling and snorting noises, but have no fear, this seems to just be a quirk of his and not malicious in any way. Wallace enjoys getting scratches and attention, but he can get overly emotional and amped up. Wallace has a history of aroused and impulsive behaviors directed toward people, including jumping and mounting, but we have had success redirecting him with treats and appropriate behavior. His new owners will need to spend some time working with him in order to improve his manners. Wallace may be most successful in an adult only home, however, if there are kiddos, it is required that they be 8 years or older. If you have room in your family for this hunk, make a phone appointment today.\t Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Black Weight: 49.6lbs Age: 6yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

He\u2019s a true pit in that he always wants to be around you and loves attention. Adopting him at 6, you wouldn\u2019t have to train anything. He is already established in what is wrong and right.

I am looking for a home with another playful dog , preferably a male, cats are a big NO.    I have a lot of puppy energy and love to run and play with my 2 doggie fosters. I would love going to doggie daycare and also training with my new people.  I'm just learning about basic manners and leash skills. I need someone who wants to work on making me the best doggie I can be, and that includes training for the both of us! If you feel I could be a fit for your home, please go to the Blackdog All Breed Rescue website and fill out an application. Must be local to the Chicago land area. \n\nYou must fill out an application if you are interested in MOCHA. Go to https://www.blackdogallbreedrescue.com to get an application. \n",

He is learning to trust the staff and he gets along with other dogs he's with when hanging out in the office.

I had a home and like so many dogs I lost  my home because my family didn\u2019t train me when I was a puppy.   Puppy behaviors became less amusing to them as I became an adult but I didn\u2019t know what I was even doing wrong. Ironically I know all the commands, sit, down, come.  I just get excited.  \n\nSo now I need a family that will  give me love and show me what behaviors they want from me.  Positive reinforcement works best with me. I\u2019m a petite girl, my mom was a pure bred staffy bull and I weigh under 50 pounds. I love people and do well with other dogs but will only be placed as an opposite sex placement. \n\n If you are looking for a beautiful, spirited, happy, smaller girl, I am the one!  If you want to meet me please fill out the application. I am a cross post for another rescue , but everyone loves me so much they are helping!\n\n\nPepper will only be placed into a forever home that is located within 1.5 hours of Lake & McHenry Counties in Illinois...(sorry, NO exceptions).**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an application:at www.aandsrescue.com/AdoptionApplication100109.doc\n\n Once your completed application is received, it will be reviewed, and then a volunteer will contact you. \n\n*We cannot do anything until we receive your completed application*",

            "description": "Meet Pennie, a 2 yr old dalmatian female turned into us by her family. She spent the first two years of her life outside during the day and locked in a cage at night.  So she's due for a fabulous home. She LOVES to play with other dogs and is the usual very very active and busy young dalmatian so she MUST go to a home with another young medium to large size dog or two she can play and snuggle with.  And given that she was bred to run 25-30 miles a day, she MUST have a TWICE DAILY STRENUOUS EXERCISE schedule to keep her happy and healthy. Walks around the block a few times once or twice a day just won't cut it with this busy girl.  Pennie would be best without young children.  We are looking for dog owners experienced  with the high energy dogs, dalmatians, cattledogs, aussies, border collies.  Prior dalmatian owners are preferred. Please do not apply if you do not have another dog or are not  experienced with the high energy dogs.  Pennie is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped and ready to go when the right home and family comes along.  Pehaps it will be your's.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Pennie, have another dog or two and are an experienced dog owner, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern  by email to dalrescue@sbcglobal.net and request an adoption questionnaire. \n You should also be able to access the questionnaire from the website homepage at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  Once the completed questionnaire is returned, and if it looks like Pennie might be a good fit for you and your family and other dog(s), arrangements can be promptly made for you and your family and other dog(s) to come meet Pennie at the kennel where she lives and see how everyone gets along. She loves where she lives now but who wouldn't after the life she had before, but we know she will truly blossom in a home where she gets all of the love, exercise and attention she needs.     \n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, please see our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love seeing posts and photos of life with your spotty friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!",

This guy gets along with other dogs, cats and children!  He loves to take walks and enjoys playing.\n\nSimba is a 4 year old Pomeranian who is heart worm negative, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered.  He will thrive in a single family house because he can get vocal when left alone.  His new family will need the patience to help him overcome some separation anxiety.  He is currently at our Atlas (Queens) location. Please download our adoption application and email the completed form to adopt@bobbicares.org if you would like to meet this adorable pup. Kindly keep in mind that our adoptions are local only (Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan).",

            "description": "Lancelot was born into a large dog hoarding house where he lived outside only. When he was about one year old, all the dogs were set free and roamed as a pack. Lancelot was one of the 13 roaming dogs that were aprehended by animal control and brought to the Palm Springs Animal Shelter.\nLancelot did do well in the home of his initial adopter where he learned commands and was effectionate with his caregiver. Sadly, after two-and-a-half years, the friction between he and another small dog in the home became too large of an issue.\nLancelot will thrive in a quiet home where he is the only dog or with a neutral low energy large dog. In his previous home he bonded with one person more than the others-- so a single owner home maybe easier or experienced owners with fearful dogs. Please submit an application online.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4521195.\n\nThis amazing pup is currently At Risk for Euthanasia! If you are interested in saving this pet, please visit this site: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nHelp! Foster needed or I will be put down 1/20 in shelter!\n\nHi I'm Evan, sadly, I am set to be euthanized Wedn., Jan. 20th, 8 am. One of the saddest reasons a dog can be E-listed is because they are mentally breaking down in their kennel. This is what's happened to me. I am really struggling and it is inhumane to keep me here in this condition....Can someone save my life?\n\nEvan has been the perfect model for social distancing this past year, unfortunately for him in dogs its called \"undersocialized.\" This means our big guy just isn't sure what to do with people or dogs near him. We're not sure what the past 2 years of this guys life has been like, but now he is wary of movement and hates his kennel. We don't blame him! The most heartbreaking of notes, \"dog did not wag tail at all during interaction.\" Poor Evan just doesn't know what to do! He did have a positive interaction with a small dog, but never fully relaxed his skinny muscles. We recommend a very slow, calm transition so he can realize that you and your family don't mean him any hard! Evan is a handsome 2 year old pup looking for his furever home to give him a 2nd chance for the rest of his life.\n\nTo meet me, please call 480 331 4188 or message us here. If you have a dog you need to bring down for a dog intro. Dog Savers has got over 230 E-listed dogs in the last year out of the shelter alive! A small percent of the donations go to our operating costs to help these dogs get out alive. Lets keep working together to save lives!!\n\nMy ID is #A4521195...you'll need that if you want to save me. I am located in Phoenix Az.\n\n#shelterdogs #phoenix #dogsofinstagram #adopt #shelterdogsrock #bugtotherescue #whosavedwho #onedogatatime #pitbull #pit #pitbullsofinstagram #adoptdontshop #doglife #cute #doglover #lovemydog #dogsofig #pet #mutt #rescue #rescuedog #rescuedogsofinstagram #FindYourFido #MaricopaCountyAnimalCareAndControl #TagYourWag #petadoption #adoptionistheonlyoption #adoptadog #rescueme",

He doesn't really like cats, and he hasn't been around small children. \n\nLinus has a cleft palate, but it doesn't affect his ability to eat. It just makes him look a little quirky! He also has anemia and a heart murmur, and he takes prescription medicine twice per day (if it is placed in his food bowl with his meals he will take the medicine with no problem). \n\nLinus is not 100% housebroken but almost! He does best when kept on a schedule. He will also use puppy pads. \n\nLinus loves squeaky toys!! He will occasionally chew on a chew bone. He also loves to cuddle and will just melt into you when he lays on your lap. He is a very sweet low energy boy who just wants to hang out with his person.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks.\n\nCan you say BEAR?!! Duke is a big, handsome, Akita male with a heart of gold. He is a calm boy that doesn't react to other dogs and can be close to good female dog friends. He has a good attitude, walks well on a leash and really isn't a bother to anyone. He would do best with a family with older adult children because of his size, and could do well with a like-sized female. Like all male Akitas, he may need a little time to trust and warm up to you but he does so quickly if you respect his space. This guy is a loyal, lovable bear!! Meet him Duke today!! Email: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information.\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Major knows what being a best friend is all about! He is very sweet and affectionate, loving to be by your side. He can become very attached to his owners, thus protective, therefore he needs to be slowly introduced to new people. Major walks well on leash and is a calm quiet boy unless he knows you are coming to get him, then he wiggles and calls for you, excited to spend time with his friend! He is great with his bath and is just a wonderful boy. He is friendly with other dogs but doesn't appreciate some bossy boy Akita's. Due to his protective Akita spirit he is best in a home with adults and one that has experience with the breed.

            "description": "*********** RESCUE ONLY **********\n\nCLYDE is \"rescue only\" which means that he will only be released to an approved rescue and not adopted out directly from the shelter.\n\nCLYDE was brought to the shelter as a stray and was extremely fearful when he first arrived, so much so that his future was uncertain.  Two of the volunteers worked with him a lot and CLYDE is now becoming the dog he was meant to be!  CLYDE is still a bit timid when meeting new people and unsure in new situations, and considering how he was when he first came in, the shelter staff and the two volunteers who have worked with him think that it's best he go to a rescue organization first to gain a little more confidence before being adopted out to his new home.\n\nCLYDE knows \"sit\" and \"down\" and he seems to be housebroken.  He has been fine with the other dogs, but no idea how he is with kids or cats. CLYDE is very food-motivated, so training should be a snap!  \n\nThere is no pull fee for 501c3 rescues and some transport help is available.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the dogs or the adoption process please visit our Facebook page and our website: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/woodcountydogshelter\nhttp://www.co.wood.oh.us/dogshelter\n\nAdoption Policy:\n\nThe adoption fee for any dog is $89.00.\n\nAdopters will receive a $75.00 spay/neuter voucher. The voucher can be used for veterinary care only if the dog is already spayed or neutered.\n\nAdopters will also receive a current Wood County Dog license.\n\nThe majority of the dogs available for adoption and transfer were found as strays, as a result the shelter does not have vaccination history. Vaccinations or vaccination history is not included unless otherwise indicated by shelter personnel.\n\nState law requires the Wood County Dog Shelter to house dogs for specific time periods prior to the dog's adoption to the public or transfer to a rescue organization. All dogs at the shelter are available for adoption or transfer on or after their available date. Please call the shelter to determine a dog's available date. \n\nAdoption Requirements:\n\nAdopters shall be eighteen years of age or older.\n\nAdopters shall be permitted to own a dog at the address listed on the adoption application. Adopters residing with parents, renting their home or renting their land may be required to provide written, signed and dated permission by the homeowner, landowner or landlord authorizing the dog to reside at the residence.\n\nAdopters shall not breed the dog and shall spay or neuter the dog, at their own expense, within thirty days of the adoption date or upon the dog reaching six months of age unless the spay or neuter is contraindicated in writing by a licensed veterinarian. The Wood County Dog Shelter may provide a spay or neuter certificate to the adopter in an amount determined by the Board of County Commissioners to reduce the adopter's spay or neuter expense.\n\nAdopters shall provide adequate food, water, shelter and veterinary care to the dog in accordance with RC 959.\n\nAdopters shall confine and license the dog in accordance with RC 955.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding available dogs or adoption in general please give us a call at 419-354-9242 or email us at wcdogshelter@co.wood.oh.us.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Fill out an Adoption Application\nPuppy Adoption Policy:\nTo ensure proper house training and socialization, puppies will only be adopted to homes where an adult will not be away more than an hour per day, per month of age of the puppy, up to 6 months.\nPuppies will be adopted out on a 'Foster to Adopt' basis. This means that if/when your application is approved to adopt, you sign a contract stating you are fostering the puppy until the time it is neutered/spayed at your expense. Giant breed puppies should not be spayed/neutered before 12 months of age. All non-giant breed puppies must be spayed/neutered by the age of 6 months, unless otherwise recommended by your veterinarian. We will amend the Foster-to-Adopt contract to make the puppy legally yours, only when we receive a spay/neuter certificate from you or your veterinarian. If the puppy is not spayed/neutered as required, we will take possession of the puppy once again.\nSandy is an English Mastiff pup approximately six months old. At some point in her short life her front left leg was amputated. She was taken in as a stray, so no one knows her history, but the leg is completely healed and does not give her any issues.\nA dog carries 70% of their weight on their front legs so missing a front leg puts a lot of stress on the remaining leg. Sandy is a typical puppy that wants to run, play, and follow her owner but she also tires quickly. To compensate she will lay down often, if she's not moving she's laying down.\nSandy can navigate stairs, but potential adopters need to consider possible mobility issues as she ages. Outside steps may require a ramp at some point and it would be best if she doesn't have to navigate interior stairs everyday.\nLikes: She loves touching. People or other dogs, it doesn't matter, she just loves everyone.\nDislikes: Haven't found anything\nPersonality: Typical puppy. She is friendly and outgoing. Playful and interested in everything\nTemperament: Laidback. She's very calm and tolerant of anything done to her.\nEnergy level: The extra work required to get around tires Sandy out faster than a four-legged puppy would tire. She does enjoy going outside and playing but she also enjoys a good nap on the couch.\nFavorite activities: Sandy really enjoys chew bones. She also enjoys attention from her human.\nGood with: Sandy is great with people, dogs, and children. she is learning how to behave around cats.\nNot good with: Haven't found anything\nHousetrained: Sandy has never pooped in the house. She had a few accidents when she first arrived but after the first couple of weeks, with proper attention by the humans, she not had an accident since.\nCrate trained: She goes in and sleeps well in her crate. She may occasionally bark but not for long and settles down quickly.\nChallenges: Hopping on three legs is tiring and when tired Sandy can become unsteady in her footing. Carpets or secure rugs will improve her footing. Stairs should be kept to a minimum.\nAny Medical issues? As she ages Sandy may need extra joint supplements. A good Veterinarian can help with her ongoing needs.\nSandy is a healthy, young pup that does not know she has a handicap. She will thrive in a home where she is loved and where her mobility needs are met. She would do well in a house with children or dogs and would be just as happy in a quiet house. Sandy is so sweet and loving, she will be a great dog for the luckily family that adopts her.\nSandy is being fostered in DeGraff, Ohio.\nApplication Fees, Adoption Donations and Rescue Policy: Please know that 100% of our funds are used for rescuing the dogs.\nOur rescue policy requires the following:\n\nAdopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina and parts of New York.\nWe will not adopt a giant breed dog to homes where the dog will have access to highly varnished hardwood steps inside the home. Any inside steps to which the dog(s) have access, must have carpeting, securely fixed stair treads, or a non-skid surface. We encourage you to remediate potential safety issues while your application is under review, prior to the home visit.\nMethods or devices using pain or force on the dog to control the dog, or to deter undesirable behavior is prohibited.\nApplications for giant breed dogs must be submitted by the property owner.\nHomes with children under 6 years of age will not be approved for adoption.\nHomes with children should have a fenced yard.\nPets currently in the applicant's home must have a history of appropriate veterinary care. Veterinary records will be checked.\nAll references must be checked before any visitation of the dog is permitted at the foster home.\nAll family members must be present during the home visit to the applicant's home.\nAny dog(s) in the applicant's home must have an introductory meeting with the rescue dog being considered, before any adoption can be completed.\nHomes with intact dogs will not be approved for adoption. Exceptions to this policy can be found on the Adoptable Dog Page.\n\nFor additional information please review our FAQs or contact mastiffstomutts@gmail.com\nMastiffs To Mutts Rescue reserves the right to approve or deny any adoption that occurs through this organization without disclosure. We reserve the right to make exceptions for special circumstances.",

            "description": "Applications now being accepted!! ROCKY is a handsome, friendly young lab mix dog who is estimated around 2 years old. He's come a long way in the last few weeks with leash training with his foster, but is still a work in progress. He is shy around new people (especially men) and takes a little time to get comfortable but once he does, he is the most loving dog.  He loves to snuggle and cuddle but also loves to play.  Rocky has never shown any signs of aggression with food, treats, or when he has been afraid of a loud noise or quick movement.  He is doing well with leash training and loves to go on walks.  His foster mom even takes him for long runs on a leash and he is the perfect running companion!  He does pull a bit on the leash on walks and is working on controlling his excitement to walk by his person rather than running ahead.  He has also learned to sit for a treat.  Rocky would do well with some obedience training as he aims to please.  He would do best in a home with another dog as he looks up to his foster brother for a playmate and companion.  \nHe's not yet cat-tested. Contact us for more details as we continue to get more information from our foster.\n\nAdoption fee covers: all vetting to age (including deworming, deflea etc ), spay/neuter (to be done at 6-8 months of age if not already done and included in adoption fee),  free 30 days of pet insurance, 6 week obedience course (or reimbursement for positive-based classes), and lifetime support of rescue.\n\nPlease fill out an application here for consideration: Tinyurl.Com/appshdr\n\n* During this COVID-19 crisis, we are essentially doing only virtual application processing and meetings are using social distancing practices. We will not have any open hours until further notice and doing meet and greets by appointment with the utmost caution for personal safety. We are not a shelter so there are NO DOGS AT THE SHOP unless we have open hours. All our dogs are in foster care and are available to be seen by appointment.\n\nNOTE: If a dog is listed as Adoptable, he or she is still available at that time. Also, our adoption area is within a several hour radius of us in Rochester, NY (NOT including Canada - sorry!)\n",

We believe he will be on the medium size when full grown as mom was on the smaller side. Rowdy is very social and friendly. He  loves everyone he meets, both human and canine, but might be too much for young children.  Our little guy  is healthy and ready to find a family to call his own.\n\nRowdy's adoption fee is $350 which includes his neuter if done at an approved clinic. Currently he is microchipped and up to date on puppy vetting.

This little nugget is soooo sweet...sadly his previous owners didn't do right by him and when we got him he was missing most of his hair---and the hair he did have was all matted. We shaved him down and now Bubba is comfortable and flea free!!! Bubba is heartworm positive and he will undergo treatment with us after which he will be available for adoption. Bubba has also a growth on his tail which will also be removed by our veterinary team. We will consider a foster-to-adopt situation to the right applicant. but they must be willing to bring him to our vet for his heartworm treatment. Bubba is just a wonderful little guy who loves everyone and is ready to give his trust and love to his human----if that is you please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org ADOPTION FEE: $300.00",

I have the best personality and am laidback! I am good with cats and other dogs. I do prefer the female dogs more than the males. I will need a fenced in yard in my new home too. I have mastered crate and house training. I like to have some space and eat in private, and no I will not share my food with anyone!  Get your own kibble!  You could say I\u2019m a super smart boy! Life is all about the thrill when you spend forever with me, Phil! \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

He's NOT leash trained yet and so will need a home with a fully fenced-in yard for his safety. He was dumped at the shelter with 2 cats and 2 other dogs so has lived with both of them without issue. His current foster also has cats and dogs and he is fine with both. He is shy at first, but then loves everyone. Contact us for more details as we continue to help socialize this dog to a home and people and he gains confidence. Older children who are able to understand his need for learning about a family would be ideal. No children under 8\n\nAdoption fee covers: all vetting to age (including deworming, deflea etc ), spay/neuter (to be done at 6-8 months of age if not already done and included in adoption fee,  free 30 days of pet insurance, 6 week obedience course (or reimbursement for positive-based classes), and lifetime support of rescue.\n\nPlease fill out an application here for consideration: Tinyurl.Com/appshdr\n\n* During this COVID-19 crisis, we are essentially doing only virtual application processing and meetings are using social distancing practices. We will not have any open hours until further notice and doing meet and greets by appointment with the utmost caution for personal safety. We are not a shelter so there are NO DOGS AT THE SHOP unless we have open hours. All our dogs are in foster care and are available to be seen by appointment.\n\nNOTE: If a dog is listed as Adoptable, he or she is still available at that time. Also, our adoption area is within a several hour radius of us in Rochester, NY (NOT including Canada - sorry!)",

She's terrified to get in the car but once she's in she is calm.   That makes the destination all that much more appreciated especially if it involves going to the park to watch the ducks.\n\nYes, Charity liked to watch the duck at the park.    We were quite pleased she didn't want to chase them!\n\nThis is a nice dog.   A sweet dog.   She needs a home where she can stretch out, watch some TV, then take a nice long walk before dinner.\n\nCome on....you know you think she is the cutest thing ever.  Come on.....fill out our application\n\nhttps://dawgsquad.org/adoption-application/",

Her adoption fee is $200 and that will include her spaying and microchip.  For that reason we only adopt to a family within a 200 mile radius of Powell/Cody area.

If you live close by, can you come to Houston to pick me up, please?\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue also requires an established vet history for a dog that you have now or have previously had.\n\nWanna know more about me? OK, here goes! I am a little Long-Haired Chihuahua/Terrier mix girl. I am 10 MONTHS old and I weigh 13 pounds. I have had all of my shots and have been spayed. YIKES! I am crate-trained and house-trained using a doggie door. \n\nI like other doggies! I like cuddling with my peeps. I like adults and children 12 and over.  Since I'm little, my foster peeps don't want me to be around small children. They might squeeze me too hard and I probably wouldn't like it.\n\nI am all set to go live at your house. Uh, how about calling it \u201cour\u201d house, OK? Those funny-looking creatures, named humans, I think they are called, told me that they think that I am pretty darn cute. What do YOU think, huh?\n\nCan you stand hearing more good stuff about me? I love people and I love cuddling......I get along with everyone and I am very affectionate. Just give me a few minutes, if that, and I will be your best friend forever! \n\nOh, how I would love to have my own home and some peeps to cuddle with and they could love me and take good care of me. That is my first dream! My second dream is all about treats and playing and romping with my new family. Ah, I can see it all now!\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com  and she can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  My adoption fee is $350 USD and includes my vaccines, spaying,  and microchip.\n",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nDue to no fault of her own, this sweet girl is looking for a forever home.  She is good with other dogs and loves people.  She will make an excellent addition to an adult family with children over ten.  Her adoption fee is $200.\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

Terrance keeps a clean kennel and is very food motivated which should make basic training a breeze. We think this boy is so handsome, don't you?\n\nTerrance will be available for adoption on 1/15/2021 at 2:58 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

We are Livestock friendly and house trained. I'm 8 years old and my mom is Wendy. I still need to be neutered, but I am vaccinated for Distemper/Parvo and Rabies and treated for parasites.\nIf you are interested in adopting this wonderful dog, call us at 530-695-3814 or you can visit our website at www.sbk9rescue.com, To fill out an application. When you arrive at our website, click the adopt tab on the top of page and you will be taken to the Adopt page, and on the bottom is an online application. If your application is approved, we will contact you.  At times, we receive many many applications for the same dog, and we cannot possibly contact everyone that fills out an application.

She \n\nMissy  is a very strong, energetic girl who is going to need training, work on leash manners, and patient teacher as he is not house-trained. It is unknown what kind of life she and her brother had before a good citizen took them in after they had been abandoned so Missy is looking for a home with a strong, active family who have a securely fenced yard. It is unknown how she interacts with other dogs, but she does tend to be very vocal. While in foster she did not do well with the indoor cat. She is volunteer favorite and adores the kids. \n\nMissy says \"Hello, people! I enjoy lots of cuddles; let's have snuggle time and play with toys too! Please understand I'm still just a really big puppy who is going to need training, including house-training, with my positive-reinforcement patient human(s). Please those with cats know that I really like chasing them and should probably not have them in my new home. I do love friends and look forward to meeting you.\"\n\nActive Family Preferred\n\nIf you have further questions, emails are the only method of communication at this time. We all care about the health of our 2-legged caregivers and the community at large, so as a precaution we are temporarily suspending our public open hours.

She has a typical energetic puppy personality and loves to run and chew on things. She is very friendly and playful and loves everyone. If you're looking for a good running buddy look no further she will keep you active! She can be stubborn and likes to dig but she just needs some direction and maybe a bit of training to help teach her. She was originally a stray and is just so excited about the idea of living in a new home! She will sleep on the floor or outside and loves to go for car rides. She know what sit and treat means and can be touched anywhere. This pet is heartworm positive and new owner would need to get her treated at a veterinary facility after adopting her. She has been started on a pre-treatment during her stay here at the shelter.",

Ivy and I was pulled from Caswell County Animal Shelter just over a week ago. Our owner dumped us at the shelter and said he had too many dogs .The shelter immediately reached out to our rescue because we needed out of the shelter since we were owner surrenders. The shelter was full and our lives was at risk. I am 3 years old and HW negative but Ivy is 5 years old and HW positive. My rescue said they could not pull one and not both of us so here we are. We have both been seen by the vet and and I\u2019m in good health. Ivy developed a cough shortly after help came for us and we found out she has nasty heart worms! She is heart worm positive and we need to get her started on fast kill treatment ASAP. We must be fostered/adopted together because I looks to Ivy for guidance and reassurance since she I am a little timid and shy. We know we are asking a lot for someone to take on fostering or fostering to adopt both of us while Ivy is doing treatment but we know someone out there can help us. We are located in boarding now and Ivy needs a home to rest and recouperate in that isn\u2019t stressful. She needs to remain calm during and after treatment and me be by her side and with her. Ivy has been started on doxycycline and will need to get her shots in 30 days so the clock is ticking for us. Please share in hopes to find us a foster home. Our rescue pays all vet bills and will pay for food etc if needed. We just need help so Ivy has the best chance of recovery. Please help us we are good girls and promise to be on our best behavior.\nLove Holly",

Red Dog adores people, walks, squeaky toys and romping around the yard. \n\nRed Dog is a strong, energetic fellow who is going to need training, work on leash manners, and patient teacher as he is not house-trained. It is unknown what kind of life he and his sister had before a good citizen took them in after they had been abandoned so Red Dog is looking for a home with a strong, active family who have a securely fenced yard. It is unknown how he interacts with other dogs, while in foster he did not do well with the indoor cat, but he adores every human he meets. \n\nRed Dog says \"Hello, people! I enjoy walks and cuddles; let's enjoy cuddle time and play with squeaky toys too! Please understand I'm still just a really big puppy who is going to need training, including house-training, with my postive-reinforcement patient human(s). I love friends and look forward to meeting you.\"\n\nIf you have further questions, emails are the only method of communication at this time.

            "description": "Zander is a neutered male Weimaraner/ Pointer mix born on 5/13/2020.\nHe weighs about 55 pounds and will grow some more. Zander is a playful and loving boy who enjoys fetch and tug of war. He likes to splash in water- play pool, friendly hose games or creek. He is a low-key, gentle soul who enjoys watching TV with his family (his favorite is Pup Academy on Netflix).\nZander has been sweetly social with the dogs (of various sizes and ages) and the people he has met. He has ignored horses in pasture at his foster home. He is very affectionate with his foster family, but can bark protectively when he sees new strangers. With an introduction, he has gotten along with new people very well. Zander is not suitable for a home with cats. He is very eager to please, highly trainable, and easily correctable with no more than a firm no.\nThis handsome fellow has some large scars from significant neglect. He was found at about 4 months of age with a deeply imbedded collar needing emergency surgery to remove. Zander should wear a harness, rather than a collar for this reason. He also has some other large scars which were healed at the time of his finding. Zander has healed well, both physically and emotionally. Now he just wants to be the loving, gentle puppy that he was meant to be.\nHe is house trained, leash trained, crate trained, and is intelligent. He thrives on gentle, consistent training and wants to be devoted to a family.\nThe adoption fee is $300.00 and includes medical care, deworming, microchip, vaccinations, flea and tick treatment, and neuter.\nTo adopt please go to the following link and fill out an application: https://www.leeshorerescue.com/apply.html",

He is strong and can pull on a leash so a harness might be best moving forward to help him with his leash manners. Red Skelton would do best in a home with no cats as he can't resist chasing them. He is outgoing and food motivated, sitting for treats on command; but watch your fingers, sometimes he isn't very gentle when a grabs them. Red Skelton is a great dude and he enjoys all life has to offer. He loves running around off leash and actually it doesn't take long for him to settle down, so he doesn't need a ton of exercise overall, just routine walks and maybe some backyard play with a tennis ball. Red Skelton loves to play with tennis balls, he isn't the most graceful, but gives it his all when attempting to catch/chase them.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

She will need a quieter household, a friendly, calm, dog buddy, a family with patience willing to help this shy girl on her journey as she continues to develop confidence. A fenced yard is an absolute must. Atchison is completely housebroken. She is trained to use the bells. She sleeps through the night (not in a crate). Atchison is a quiet girl but will alert you to squirrels and approaching strangers. She loves going on walks. Atchison is treat motivated. She knows sit and is working on coming when called.\n\nTo be considered the first step is to apply here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton \nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425. This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

He came to the rescue after his owner died and was in rough shape.\n\nHe is very sweet with other dogs and pretty relaxed. He naps most of the time but is always alert when meal time comes along. He was diagnosed with kidney disease, so he is on prescription food and needs to potty more frequently (But he looks pretty cute in his little male wrap diapers). Chuchi has never met a blanket or bed he doesn't like! He also loves to perch on the back of the sofa and look out the window (when attended by his foster mom).\n\nHe has very bad teeth, and we expect him to lose most or all of them at his dental. He will be available for adoption sometime in February.\n\nThis gentle and happy boy will bring a smile to your face every time you see him!",

            "description": "Google 'Austrian Pinscher' That is what he looks like - exactly. 2 yrs, 30 lbs. If whoever adopts him does the DNA we'll know for sure. Sometimes a dog that looks like an obscure purebred is actually a mix of 4-5 others. And sometimes it's the obscure purebred. Way back in the beginning, we worked so hard to save what we called a schnauzer/bassett - named her Snazzy. This was in Long Beach - 28 years ago. We were combing the soft cover Simon and Schuster dog breed book daily - and found a gorgeous purebred 'Petite Bassett Griffon Vendeen' pretty exotic name, eh? Turned out that's exactly what Snazzy was!\nThis guy will climb things.....and does not like to be left alone. Very gentle, EZ-going, friendly.\nIn order to get appointment, email your completed application. See beaglesandbuddies.com - adopt a dog section. Tell us all about any other dog/s, cat/s, kid/s - name, age, size, sex, spayed/neutered, how long dog would be home alone on any given day - now and after pandemic abates. Appts are 1 hr on Fri, Sat from 10 am to 2 pm and Sunday from 10 to noon. Tell us your 1st and 2nd choice day/time. Plan to bring entire family. We will email you - usually takes a week or so....\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She is full of energy and loves to play with toys! Philippa is very shy when she first meets someone; however, she warms up pretty quickly and she loves to make new friends. Philippa does not get along with other dogs or cats so she will need to be the only animal in the house. She seems to know how to sit and it is possible she is house trained as well. Due to her energy level, Philippa needs to go to a home with no children under the age of 12 years old. Philippa is a 2 year old Pitbull mix and weighs 48 pounds. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please contact Chesterfield County Animal Services at (804) 748-1683, option \"0\", to schedule an appointment.

These brothers had quite a rough start, but foster mom says they are very quickly adapting to \u201cthe good life\u201d and will be ready for their forever homes very soon!\n\nTheir story is sadly a pretty common one. Irresponsible dog owners who do not take care of, nor care about their dogs enough to get them spayed. This owner\u2019s female was purchased to watch his herd of goats and became pregnant. She had a litter of 8 puppies, and instead of finding them homes he decided to keep them locked in a cow trailer! They received no socialization with humans, no daylight, and no fresh air to run around and play in. This heartless man threw food into the dirty trailer for these pups, but as the weeks passed it became apparent that, due to their breed, they were going to be large dogs, and he knew he could not afford to feed them. \n\nAgain, instead of trying to find them homes, he fed them less and less, until a kind neighbor began feeding them until he could get them help. It was only after the cruel owner confided in the neighbor that he planned to get someone to come over and \u201cget rid of them\u201d that the neighbor jumped into action. He found a rescue group willing to seize the puppies if the owner promised to spay the mother dog and this wonderful neighbor even offered to pay for it! It\u2019s with the help of all the wonderful people out there that these precious pups are able to go on to live happy lives. \n\nSeveral rescue groups stepped up to each take two puppies, and we are delighted to have Brady and Ramsey! Every day they are learning more and more to just be happy puppies. These boys are gorgeous. They have luxurious golden white fur and sweet faces. They now enjoy very much running and playing in the sunshine, and getting lots of human interaction and affection.\n\nWhen choosing a breed that is right for your family, typical characteristics of that breed need to be considered. The Karakachen is an independent working dog, immensely loyal, and devoted to their masters, trying their best to protect their household at any cost. They have a strong smelling and hearing instinct that is instrumental in making them ideal guard dogs. Though not aggressive while guarding their livestock, these territorial dogs display a highly reserved nature while confronting strangers. Apart from their compatibility with children of the family with whom they are brought up, they will also be able to mingle with other smaller pets if socialized well socialized. \n\nFrequently described as \u201cmajestic,\u201d Great Pyrenees are big, immensely strong mountain dogs standing as high as 32 inches at the shoulder and often tipping the scales at more than 100 pounds. These steadfast guardians usually exhibit a Zen-like calm, but they can quickly spring into action and move with grace and speed to meet a threat. The lush weatherproof coat is all white, or white with markings of beautiful shades of gray, tan, reddish-brown, or badger. They are smart, patient, and calm. The Great Pyrenees is an immensely powerful working dog bred to deter sheep-stealing wolves and other predators on snowy mountaintops. Pyrenees today are mellow companions and vigilant guardians of home and family.\n\nBrady is described by his foster to be a little shy and reserved. He projects a quiet assurance that he has all the answers to the world around him. He has a powerful, graceful stride, when he trots or runs; he seems to glide, with a little up-and-down movement. His gait is effortless and he is capable of trotting for 15 miles or more without tiring.\n\nBrady needs an experienced family, access to a large yard, long walks or runs and an active family that have owned or experience with dogs over 100 lbs. As an adult, his breed requires a confident, experienced owner, one who will gain his respect and understands his independent nature.\n\nBrady loves attention, is active and playful and will make a wonderful companion. He would do well in a house with a large yard and children they can run and play with. Brady and Ramsey have come so far and deserve a loving home where they are safe, have a warm bed, and are considered part of the family. Will you open your heart and home to Brady and Ramsey?\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE\nRESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5513C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n\nWe go the extra mile for every dog and do whatever it takes to make sure that that dog finds happiness, we give 100% and more.

She came to us from another rescue organization after being adopted and returned to them (through no fault of anyone). Post-adoption, it was discovered that she is diabetic and requires insulin injections 2x daily. The adopter loved her dearly but was unable to commit to that lifetime medical care and it was in Fluffy's best interest to become available for adoption again. \nShe is underweight right now, about 12 lbs, slowly putting on the pounds and she's feeling much better since starting her injections. We think that she is ~8 years old.\nDue to diabetes and the requirement for insulin injections, Fluffy will need an adoptive family who has experience with this, as well as the financial capability to care for her. She is also on prescription food.\nFluffy has cataracts due to her diabetes and moves a bit slow but she sure loves belly rubs and is as sweet and loyal as they come. She is good with dogs and all people, super gentle and loving.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Archie is a 1 year old, 27 pound, strong, fun loving, energetic boy. He appears to be a mix of a cattle dog and corgi, he has a long body and short legs and bark loud enough to alert you of anything new or exciting. Because of his bark, apartment life would not be ideal for him. He was left at an EZ Mart in Oklahoma before being taken to a shelter and transported to Aheinz57, where he is now in a foster home. His early behaviors in the home suggest he may have been an outdoor dog. He loves the outside, but has discovered he likes indoor dog toys and has gotten used to the squeaker noises. He is mostly potty trained, but has had an occasional accident or marked his new territory. He would love a fenced in yard so he can spend time running, jumping, and rolling in snow outside. His human will need a strong grip on a leash as he has a very strong desire to chase any cars while out on walks. Archie really wants to play with other pets close to his size, a friendly dog companion would be ideal. His cattle dog traits show when he has tried to herd the small pets (dog and cat) in his foster home. They do not share his enthusiasm. If you are wanting a calm cuddly dog, Archie is NOT your match, but if you are wanting a fun, happy, adventurous, dog for outdoor activities, apply now for Archie. This sweet boy is ready to love you!",

She does great in her foster home. She gets along with her foster family dogs and cats. She goes to door to let you know she needs to go potty. She would love a young large breed male dog to play with. For Piper to be successful she needs a low traffic home, no children living in the home, and a fenced in backyard.

Given her excitement level for new things we think she would do better in a home without small animals or children. Rain still needs to learn some basic manners about how to control the excitement level but she is quickly learning and responding well. She is very smart and eager to please. When she's winding down she'll just lean into you and roll over and if you sit down she'll sit on your lap. While we know she is a bit big to be a lap dog, she still wants a good cuddle now and then. Someone who understands husky behavior is preferred and would be the best fit for her.",

He loves hugs, and kisses, and dewormer, and the smells outside, and toys, and chewies, and hearing that he is, in fact, a GOOD BOY! This dog has truly embraced all of life's gifts, and finds immense joy in each of them! We know Iron Man to be good with children 10+ but cannot imagine younger children would be a problem as he is a kind hearted young man. \nHe has displayed some intense reactivity to other dogs when walked past kennels etc. and would prefer a single-dog home. But if you really have your heart set on adopting Iron Man, and you have another dog(s), we require that you bring them to your appointment for a structured and supervised meeting to see how they do together BEFORE the adoption!\n\nThe adoption fee is $250 and includes spay/neuter, first vaccinations, microchip with life-long free registration, deworming, negative heart worm test for dogs over 6 months. Age and breed are our best guess.\n\nYou can fill out an application on our website, newhoperescueinc.com by clicking on the animal's picture and then clicking on the adoption application button.

This precious boy has a story with a heartbreaking beginning of total neglect. He is the oldest of over 20 dogs who were seized from an abhorrent breeding/hording situation where they were locked in a trailer with no AC in very hot humid south MS. His condition when rescued was deplorable. He was malnourished and most of his hair was missing due to non-contagious mange. To make matters even worse he had heartworms. This poor guy needed a lot of help and a lot of work to get him healthy again. Gordy received the medical treatment and nutrition he needed one step at a time to get him healthy again. He has his furry coat back, gained some weight, and was successfully treated for his heartworms. He has made amazing progress despite having never having any kind of training and little to no socialization. Gordy took to living the good life right away. His foster mom says he is a sweet goofy energetic boy who gets along with other dogs, cats, and kids. He is completely house trained and uses a doggie door. Gordy has done wonderful when taken to the local dog park and with meeting strangers. He absolutely loves toys, but he is still learning what actually toys that he can play with are and things that he is not supposed to chew up. Obviously he will need continued training and supervision until he has these boundaries figured out but this truly is the only thing his foster mom states is 'negative' about Gordy. He does have lots of Lab energy so he will do best with a family who will be committed to giving Gordy the exercise, adventure, and continued training to guide him to being the best boy he can be. Gordy is already neutered, up to date on all vaccinations, current on preventatives, and micro chipped. Gordy is eager to please and easy to love and he's looking for that family who give him a forever special place in their lives. No more moments of despair for this boy. Gordy is looking for his chance to be loved...what a feeling to be loved.\n\nIf interested in meeting this baby, you can find an online adoption application at     https://fjcasp.wufoo.com/forms/adoption-application/       Adoption fees covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, wormers and preventatives and range from $50-$125.
