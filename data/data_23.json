            "description": "Salutations!\n\nI\u2019m Abby, a spunky and KISSY senior chi-terrier mix. My tongue is always flapping for a kiss, partly because I only have 2 teeth left\u2026 so it usually is hanging out anyways. My foster mom says there are people out there that love a silly smile and don\u2019t mind ensuring my food is wet and soft.\n\n My personality is adventurous - I have a LOT of spring in my step for 11 years old. Gotta go somewhere? I wanna go too. I\u2019ve been known to sneak out and hop in the car before anyone has time to pick me up and put me in. Going out at about in the leash and in the car is a favorite pastime. My foster mom cuddles me in her coat and takes me shopping fairly often, and I love to be held close and smell new things. \nI can be timid when I meet new people, but I warm up quick  if there are belly rubs involved. I\u2019ve met other dogs, cats, kids and even a bird with pretty good manners - though I do like to be the center of attention. \n\nAs a senior, I do need to use the ladies pad through out the day. I\u2019ve used potty pads my whole life, and am still getting used to going outside. I think we all appreciate an indoor potty in Michigan weather, right? \n\nAdditional skill sets include cleaning the french fries out of cars, announcing when packages arrive and bringing joy everywhere I go. If you know of anyone interested in a lap dog looking for love, drop a line to www.NBSar.org\n\n\nThese are the things I fur-sure need in my fur-ever home!\n- Family who is gone no longer than 5 hour periods.\n-Children must be 3yrs or older \n- 100% fenced in yard.\n-Diligent about making sure I don't sneak out open doors \n\nIf you think I might be the perfect addition to your family please follow these steps:\n\n1.) Visit www.nbsar.org to fill out my adoption application. As an approved adopter, my rescue friends can set up a home visit so I can meet you. Our rescue is 100% run by volunteers, to help your application be processed as quickly as possible, please make sure to\u2026.\n\n2.) Call your veterinarian and give them permission to release information about your current and past pet\u2019s veterinary history.\n\n3.) Call your references too! Let them know to expect a phone call from an unknown phone number, and a rescue team member will need to talk to them on the phone as a reference. \n\nMy adoption fee is $250.00 and includes a DHPP vaccine, bordatella vaccine, de-worming, spay/neuter surgery, rabies vaccine (age appropriate), heartworm test (age appropriate), heartworm preventative, flea/tick preventative, microchip insertion, bath, nail trim, ear cleaning, leash and collar and one week's worth of food. If you\u2019d like to meet me, please apply online and to become an approved adopter! \n\nOur adoption process requires that any pet in your household be current on vaccinations and heartworm preventative , spayed/neutered (unless a documented medical reason is on file with your veterinarian). Dogs must be current on Distemper DHPP combo vaccine and Rabies vaccine, cats must be current on Distemper and Rabies at the time of application. This also applies to any pets in your home within the past five years.\n\nWhile I hope that you have fallen in love with me and are ready to apply, I understand if I might not be the perfect pup for your family just yet. However, would you please help by sharing my picture on Facebook, twitter or by email? I'm a great pup and need a loving family to give all of my love and puppy kisses to! Thank-you for your help!",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nSabrina came back to rescue after it was determined she and the other resident dog were not going to work out their differences.  \n\nHer mom says, \"Sabrina is a really great little dog, sweet and fun. She loves to go for walks and car rides. She is happy just staying home too if that's where you are. She's about 6 yrs old.   She has never had accidents in the house and does not need a crate. She is used to ringing a little bell next to the door to go outside when needed. She is trustworthy to leave home alone without being destructive. She is half pomeranian and half papillon. Her hair is often kept short in the summer. She is overweight so a diet would be good for her. She has issues with other dogs so she MUST be in an only-dog family. She would be perfect for someone seeking the companionship of a wonderful little pooch who is full of love and craves head and belly rubs. \"\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet Sabrina, or any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

We rescued Adelaide from a cruelty situation and you can tell she has lived a rough life. Though she does love it when she is being groomed and petted!  She has been working on walking better on leash and is doing great! She loves to explore. Adelaide will always be very shy but her confidence is blooming. We believe she would do well in a home with other dogs because she tends to want to play in passing. Adelaide might do better in a home with older children that are respectful of her space and timidness. \n\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com",

            "description": "*This dog is in Texas and will be coming to Ontario the first weekend of February*Please apply to adopt at reddogrescue.org*\nThis baby and his siblings were born to a mama who got pregnant by another dog because their family did not have the means to get her fixed. They have lived outdoors all of their life and had never received any medical care. They all had ear infections, mange, and worms when Red Dog Rescue found them. The rescue paid for the mom to get spayed and has had each pup treated for their conditions. He would love a home who will be patient and teach him how to be an amazing family dog. With some love and consistency he will flourish into a beautiful and happy pup!\nPapa is NOT suitable for first-time dog owners and will require plenty of structure, confidence, and further training to see him transform into a confident dog*\nNotes from foster: Papa is such a lovely boy. He is so sweet, but very scared, and when he gets scared he growls. He doesn't share toys or food very well but he loves to run and play. He gets along with everyone here including my son but he is scared to meet new people . It takes him awhile to warm up but when he does he will be your best friend! He loves belly rubs! *Note some pictures are before medical intervention, where is mange can be seen.\n\nName: Papa\nWeight: ~50lb\nAge: ~11 months\nGender: Male\nBreed: Lab X\nColour: Black with white\nMedical: Treated for an ear infection, demodex mange (non-contagious), and hookworms. Papa tested heartworm positive but has received treatment for it.\nFixed: Yes\nGood with adults: Yes, however he does not like meeting new people as he is fearful. He takes time to warm up, but is loving once he does. He seems to prefer women.\nGood with kids: 12+\nGood with dogs: He is dog selective, but does well after proper introductions. Papa grew up within the same pack of dogs and will need further socializing\nGood with cats: No\nHouse trained: Working on it!\nCrate trained: Working on it!\nFood aggressive: Yes, he must be fed alone in his crate\nLeash trained: Papa does okay but will need further training\nEnergy level: Medium-high energy\nSuitable for an apartment: No\nCan be handled: Yes",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nBobo is an adorable little 7 year-old Chihuahua mix male who found himself homeless at a noisy overcrowded county dog shelter and made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could relax in a foster home while searching for a permanent new home. This little guy was understandably frightened at the shelter but has warmed up quickly now that he's out of that environment. Bobo loves snuggling with his human friends and gets along well with other dogs too. He even seemed to be fine meeting the resident vet clinic kitty. Bobo has excellent crate manners and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. He is reluctant to walk on a leash at this point but is happy to be carried outside to a fenced area where he immediately takes care of business. Bobo is not a fan of winter weather and loves snuggling up in his cozy blankets once he's back in from the great snowy outdoors. We can't wait to this little guy settling into his very own home! Bobo weighs about 11 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. Bobo has had a recent dental cleaning so now flashes a pearly white smile. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Bobo. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Bobo and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization.

Milo has now been at the shelter for over 100 days and is more than ready to find his forever home!\n\nAGE: Approximately 1.5 years.\n\nTRICKS & COMMANDS: Sit, Shake, Lay Down\n\nABOUT MILO: If you're looking for someone to bring all the happiness and love you could ever need into your home, Milo is the boy for you!\n\nMilo is a big ball of energy and is happiest when he's rolling around in the grass or getting some ear scratches. He loves to be the center of attention and playing with toys, especially ones that squeak! Milo can get distracted easily, but he would love a home that's willing to work with him on training and controlling his energy. This sweet boy loves any flavor of treats and would be very willing to learn some new tricks and commands!\n\nMilo would benefit most from a calm home with Shar-Pei breed experience so that he can be his best doggy self. After being introduced to dogs and cats at the shelter, we are unsure how Milo would do in a home with either of them. \n\nMilo can't wait to become your new 4-legged best friend and make sure you get all the doggy kisses you could ever need!\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nKing is a young dog who would benefit greatly from basic manners training.  He is active and energetic.  He would like to be the only animal in the home.  He is very people oriented.  He needs a family who can take the time to work with him to become the very best canine citizen.  He is waiting to meet you.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

We're both over a year old, we love to play (who doesn't?!), we both like kids, and we're both pretty cute. \n\nSo, what do ya think? Come meet us today, and remember, two is always better than one.\n\nWe are located at 8172 Washington Church Road, Washington Township, Ohio 45458.

They find a furever home together!\n\nBy the way, we're Bingo and Luka, and when you adopt us, you'll get double the love, snuggles, and the fun of course! We're pretty sure you're already interested in giving us our furever home, but how about we tell you a little bit about us? We're both over a year old, we love to play (who doesn't?!), we both like kids, and we're both pretty cute. \n\nSo, what do ya think? Come meet us today, and remember, two is always better than one.\n\nWe are located at 8172 Washington Church Road, Washington Township, Ohio 45458. To schedule an appointment, you can reach us during our open hours at 937-294-6505.",

I feel so lucky to have made it out of there and now I'm searching for life's great adventures with a new family!\n\nI'm a very handsome guy with a shiny black snoot and pretty white teefs! I will do best with an active family as I have tons of energy to burn! I would really like a patient adopter who will help me learn better leash manners because I'm strong and get very excited to go for walks. I do love to greet my humans with a hug and I have an abundance of kisses to happily give! Playtime is a favorite of mine and of course treats...who doesn't love cookies?! \n\nI need to meet any potential canine siblings to make sure we are a good fit for each other. If you have cats, they will need to be dog-savvy. Children should be ages 12 and older because I am a big (lovable) galoot (65 lbs.) and I need to work on my manners!\n\nWe kindly ask, if you have questions regarding Bolt, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n*************************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.

            "description": "Name: Priscilla\nBreed: Pug\nSex: Female\nAge: 7 years\nColor: Brindle\nSpecial Characteristics: always smiling, loves to be near her people\n\nHello pug friends! This lovely lady is Priscilla, a 7 yr. old brindle pug, and she is looking for her forever home! \n\nPriscilla is a charmer! She is always smiling, she loves to be near her people, and she is as sweet as they come. She is a wonderful companion and is very easy going. She loves her people and also gets along well with her pug foster siblings. \n\nShe never meets a stranger - give her 2 minutes and she will be your BFF. Her foster mom does want to let a potential adopter know that Priscilla's favorite place to sleep at night is near her person's head!! \n\nPriscilla doesn't like to admit it, but she needs to lose some weight. She is a pug so she loves to beg for treats and give you that cute pug stare, but she needs a person who will really help her shed a few pounds in order to get to a healthy weight and then maintain that weight. She enjoys playing with other dogs and taking walks, so it will be easy to get in some exercise on these nice winter days. \n\nWhen Priscilla came into rescue, she had some ear infection issues that we have helped her with. But in true pug fashion, her people will need to clean her ears regularly and keep up with them to make sure no infections return.  \n\nWhen she joined us, she also had some eye issues that we worked to address quickly.  Because her eyelid openings are quite large, she needs drops to help prevent drying of the corneas. She also has pigmentary keratitis -- this is a condition where the usually clear cornea becomes opaque (this is often due to chronic inflammation). At this time Priscilla receives several eye drops daily and this has helped her a great deal.  She has had a consultation with a specialist and they have suggested she might benefit from eyelid corrective surgery -- basically this would reduce the eyelid opening to hopefully prevent exposure drying of the corneas and eliminate hairs from rubbing on the cornea and help prevent progression of pigmentation.  This surgery would cost a couple thousand dollars.  Because it isn't urgent, we would ideally like to find an adopter for Priscilla who has pug experience and understands this procedure and would help her get this surgery.    \n\nPriscilla is up to date on her vaccines, heartworm negative and spayed. She is perfectly potty trained and a delightful housemate. \n\nWe are looking for a special rescue family for this girl -- her ideal home should have someone home a lot, previous pug experience so they understand her ongoing eye issues, and another pug playmate.\n\nIf you think Priscilla would be a great addition to your family, please complete an adoption application today at https://pugrescueofflorida.org/adopt\n\nIf you love me but can't adopt me please consider making a donation to rescue to help pay medical bills for not just me but my fellow foster brothers and sisters.\n\nMy Rescue friends are working very hard to find me and the other foster pugs new homes, so please be sure to submit an application before contacting them.\n\nMore information and  applications are available at WWW.PUGRESCUEOFFLORIDA.ORG",

He is potty trained and knows several commands. His mom and dad really want to make sure he is going to the best home possible for him.

            "description": "My name is Maggie and I am an 8 month young Red Heeler. I was left in a cage in a field in TN and that is how I was found.  Luckily I wasn't there for too long.  I hated being caged up in such a nice field. Caged in a field?!?  A Heeler needs to run in that field not be caged!  \n\nI am extremely smart and very high energy.  That is just my breed but I am smarter and faster than most!  My new family will understand my level of energy and they will keep up with me.  I really like it here in my foster home where I have another doggie that I can play with all day in the back yard.  My foster mom says that I must have a backyard where I can play and get all my energy out.  She said that I am so smart that I could be an agility dog.  What is that? I must find out! \n\nI like kids and tolerate cats and I am already a lady since I know to go outside to do my business like a proper lady should.  I also figured out how to walk on leash without dragging you all over the place. (even though I could easily do so) \nI am also crate trained and I am quiet all night.  I told you I am a lady, did you not listen? \n\nI love to play. I can play all day but when I am done I like to cuddle with my human friends. \n\nMy foster mom says that I am a beautiful girl, smart and lovely and that my forever family will be very lucky to adopt me.  Do you think so? \n\nI can't wait to meet you.  I will put a smile on your face every day of my life and I will warm your heart at night. While I patiently wait for you, I will learn this agility thing my foster mom talks about! I can climb, jump and listen to commands. What else can a girl like me do?  Let me show ya!\nUntil then\n\nLove\nMaggie.\n\nMaggie is located in our foster home in Chicago/Avondale area.  To meet this cutie, please complete an adoption application at:  https://treasuredanimalrescueinc.org/adoption-application/",

I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control and am so happy to be on my journey to finding a furever home with my new and wonderful family!  \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I haven\u2019t met other dogs at Mostly Mutts yet though I am a playful dog, so if you have a doggie who is also a fan of playing, let\u2019s meet and see if we can do that together / Cats unknown / I also haven\u2019t met kids yet at Mostly Mutts, so let\u2019s meet and best no toddlers or small children that I may bump over, and I am currently super mouthy when I play.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a happy gal who is a typical bundle of young dog energy.  Playful, fun and affectionate, I am alert and seem to have good focus \u2013 ready to learn all I need to know to be a great friend / My energy level is 8-10 which is very high, so plan to be active with me daily! \n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am now a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, where I\u2019ll be learning lots of great doggie commands with my trainer.  I\u2019ve already mastered \u2018sit\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019.  I\u2019m also working on my leash manners (I jump and weave on my leash right now but am improving).  I love treats so this will make my training fun and rewarding for both of us / My crate manners are good at Mostly Mutts / I\u2019ve had good potty habits on the shelter schedule, so hopefully that will be the case in my new home.         \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like to play and enjoy being silly with the volunteers in the play yard at the shelter, so I bet I would enjoy running around in a fenced yard with you.  I love Nyla bones and toys and I like holding one to keep my mouth busy while you harness me for a walk / I can\u2019t think of any dislikes, but I would not be a happy pup if I did not get much needed exercise, training and love.   \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.\n\nI am looking for a family that will be very active with me!  A fun family to make lots of good memories with!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

Penny walks politely on a leash, although she does have a bit of trouble walking and is a little unsteady on her feet. Staffers say she's very affectionate with handlers. Penny's former owner tells us she's housebroken and good with kids. Volunteers say Penny is friendly, affectionate and gentle. She enjoys treats (especially cheese) and taking in the sights and sounds on her walks. Penny enjoys being petted and close to people, and she really needs to get out of the shelter and into the home. If you've got a soft place in your home for a sweet girl like Penny, make an appointment to meet her today.",

Karma is housetrained, very friendly, playful, and very treat motivated. Karma does show small signs of separation anxiety - she does not like to be away from her people. She is not destructive, just tends to need to be as close to you as possible. Karma loves toys, going for walks, and playing with other dogs.\nKarma is spayed, up to date on shots, and heartworm negative.",

            "description": "A LOVING & GENTLE FRIEND:  6 \u2013 7 months old / Currently 40 lbs.\n\nHello!  My name is Jordan!  I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control \u2013 sweet, loving and ready to find my furever family!  I came in with some hair loss on my head and body, and medicated baths are helping with that. \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I like the dog in my foster home and try to engage her in play.  She is older and not interested in playing with me, but I bet I would like another dog in my new home who is looking for a playmate, so let\u2019s meet / Cats unknown / I haven\u2019t met kids yet at Mostly Mutts, but my foster thinks my temperament might be a good fit for kids, but best no toddlers that I may bump over and let\u2019s meet.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am very sweet and affectionate \u2013 a people dog!  I can be a bit timid at first in new environments, where new or strange noises can make me run and hide or show my belly in submission.  Please make sure I do not slip out the door and get lost if I hear something that startles me inside or outside.  I am generally quiet but will whimper a little when my favorite person (my foster dad) leaves the room.  I charmed the MM photographer and \u2013 don\u2019t tell anyone, but she said I may be her favorite \u2013 lol / My energy level is around a 4-6.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I know the \u2018sit\u2019 command, and my foster family is working on \u2018down\u2019 and \u2018place\u2019 with me.  I bet you can teach me even more great doggie commands.  I have good leash manners, though I am frightened of the leash itself, so I tend to hide from it.  I have learned to sit now for you to put it on, though I may be afraid of it for a while in my new home / I do well in a crate, though I\u2019ve not been crated much in my foster home.  I sleep through the night on a comfy doggie bed in my fosters\u2019 room / My potty habits have been good in my foster home, so hopefully that will be the case in my new home too.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like spending time with my people and getting lots of belly rubs \u2013 my favorite.  I am happy when I am giving or receiving affection.  I enjoy my food also and may even be a bit obsessed with it - lol / Other than the sight of the leash and strange noises that startle me, I can\u2019t think of any dislikes, though I would not be happy if I did not get the love and attention on which I thrive.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered.  I formerly had non-contagious mange, so I\u2019m on a chewable tablet twice a month through February.  I may need special baths for a little while longer which can be done in my new home.  \n\nIf you are looking to add a charming fur friend to your family, I may be your guy!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.  \n",

There is a lot of fun in this small package! Kiwi is good with other dogs, leash trained and has loved everyone she has met. Cats are a no no for her though, lol. She is a smart cookie and already knows Sit, Stay and Paw. Kiwi knows other as well and had been well trained prior to arriving into rescue. She is an all around good pup! If you would like to meet this sweetie fill out an online adoption application on our website, www.CPRFund.com and we will be in touch.\n\nKiwi's adoption fee is $300\n\nAll CPRFund dogs are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly preventative and spay/ neutered prior to placement.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Introducing this amazing duo, the owner of many of our hearts, Wilma and Wilton!! When we say we are in love with them, words cannot really do justice. Their story broke our hearts and we have cherished them since the moment we laid eyes on them! We rescued them the day after they were born. They come from a trailer park in a very destitute place. Their mom had lived there since as far back as the folks there could remember, but she was not treated kindly. Her owners didn\u2019t feed, water or provide adequate shelter for her. She would sleep in a bed of nails and insulation outside under a trailer. According to the people we spoke with, she was obviously pregnant. Someone nearby went looking when they didn\u2019t see her that day and found her at night, having just given birth, in her dirty fiberglass nest she made... she was desperately trying to keep her babies warm and it was only about 20 degrees outside. After finding them she tried everything to get someone to save them that day. Our volunteer wasn\u2019t close by but eventually word got to her the next day and she went ASAP to save them. Upon arrival was devastating heartbreak. Without going into graphic detail, we will say the only survivors were Wilma and Wilton. They were taken, along with their mom, and finally got the love and care they deserved.\nTheir mom was in an extremely poor physical state due to severe neglect and sleeping in fiberglass, but she did everything she could to raise these two. Their mom has the most incredible heart of gold you could have imagined. The story of Wilma and Wilton, and their amazing mother, will live within us always. \nIt is now that we are delighted to present these two remarkable survivors!! These two healthy, strong, gorgeous, wonderful, sweet babies, Wilma and Wilton!! They are a bonded pair and we are committed to placing them together. They love each other so much, and after their start in life we cannot imagine ever separating them! Wilma looks JUST like her mama!! And she is a strong and a brilliant old soul, just like her! She is the more confident of the two and you can tell she is destined for greatness! Wilton is a glorious mushball who follows Wanda\u2019s every move and adores her! They are an amazing dynamic duo and not only adore playing and snuggling with each other, but they loooove people!! If you snuggle on the couch with them they will start out by giving you hundreds of kisses and nibbles!! They are MASTER snugglers!!! Soooo super adorable and in love with their people!! They are so remarkable and we are determined to find parents for them who are just as remarkable! They need parents who reflect them:) super loving, affectionate, sweet, strong and confident! They need parents who LOVE to snuggle with their pups and will be committed to them as family members! They would love a big yard to run and play with and parents who would love to bring them in car rides and treat them as their kids! These babies are amazing and we cannot wait to see their dreams come true!! If you would love to be the lucky person to welcome these two amazing babies to your family, please visit our website and submit an application for adoption today!! www.greatdivideanimalrescue.org",

Like most of his breed, he is very high energy and will need parents that can provide daily exercise and mental stimulation. He would do best in a home with a secure fenced in yard. Rochester should not be left alone outdoors for a long period of time as huskies are escape artists. Unfortunately, he does not get along with other dogs or small animals such as cats and will need to be the only dog in the home. Rochester would make an amazing fit for anyone looking to bond and build a relationship through training! \n\nAge: 2-3 years\nSex: Male\nWeight: 65 lbs\nHW +",

            "description": "Hi Future Family!\u00a0\n\nI'm Matilda and I'm looking for my own very own Miss Honey! I'm a sweet and energetic pup - here are some things about me!\n\nFavorite things:\nAttention! Give me attention and I'm a happy, happy girl!\nSniffs! I love all the smells and my nose does not stop! That also means that I might get so caught up on a smell and travel farther than I realize - a harness/leash and \u00a0fence is important to keep me safe!\nPlaying! I love to play with my doggie foster brother! It wears me out..\nToys! it's important that I have appropriate toys to chew on so that I don't chew on your favorite things. If I have the right toys, I'm good to go!\nRelaxing and recharging on a dog bed! I play hard and then I rest hard - it's that simple!\nHumans: Humans are the best! I'm learning that I can get pets without jumping, but I need some work on that! My foster family doesn't have little humans so they aren't sure how I'll do, but because of my jumping, I'll probably do best with older children.\n\nOther dogs: Before I came to Minnesota, I had puppies that I was responsible for protecting. I still think it's my job to be protective and I'm slow to warm up to dogs. Once I'm comfortable, I LOVE to play. Did I mention that I really love my fur foster brother? I'd probably like a doggie sibling, but I will absolutely need a slow and patient introduction. I did struggle to share our bed and toys so I need a doggie sibling that reads my cues and is flexible with sharing while we work on this together. I think this could get easier for me! My foster mom and dad say that I can trust them to let me know which dogs are friends and to make sure I have everything I need - I don't need to act so tough or be protective of my stuff. They said when I join your family, you'll do the same for me.. but it will take a little time for me to learn that you've got my back!\n\nLeash training: I LOVE walks! I'm so excited that I do pull on a leash and I need some work on that. I really think I might like to be your running or hiking buddy!\n\nCrate training: So far, so good! I get a little sad and I do protest when you leave me, but if I've had enough exercise, I'll just snooze away until you come back! I sleep in my crate at night in the same room as my foster family. It's great!\n\nHouse training: I'm super close to being house trained! I've had a couple accidents, but my foster mom says that can happen after big changes. I\u2019m also starting to communicate when I need to go outside! Also, where is all your grass?! Thankfully the snow doesn't bother me, but it was confusing at first!\n\nCommands: I'm learning sit, come, leave it. I'm motivated by treats and I think I can learn quickly! I will just need continued and consistent training. If you work hard, I'll work hard! I promise!\n\nI\u2019m really looking for a loving family that will give me attention, likes to help me exercise, and is willing to work on my training!\nIf you would like to meet Matilda, please visits spotslaststop.org and fill out an application.\n",

Quick to learn, she already knows to sit on command, goes straight to her kennel when it's meal time and politely waits for her food to be brought to her.  Crate trained, and almost fully house trained.  Remi is going to make a family very happy when she moves in!  Est.  DOB is 11/26/2020.

Tequila needs a home that will remain dedicated to helping him learn his manners. He is working hard on house-training, and would benefit from learning gentle play. We are asking that his forever home have no one under the age of 13. This handsome boy is extremely loyal when he gets close to his people, and will need their help learning to greet guests politely. Once intros are out of the way, he is as social as they come! Tequila enjoys the company of other small dogs, as long as they share in his joy of playtime. He is a little over 30 pounds, and five months old. \n\nThis athletic canine would adore a human running partner and has no trouble soaking up the snugs after.

Several of us have blue eyes so maybe dad is an Aussie mix? We are not sure - but we assume we'll need a very active home given our potential breed! Probably not a good fit for small children...\n\nWe are all rolly, polly happy pups are love playing with the adult dogs in our home! We are working on basic puppy chores like using pee pads, sleeping and eating ... and we are ALL very treat motivated!!\n\nFollow our litter at https://www.facebook.com/groups/730933680862403",

She will need someone who can set boundaries with her so she knows she doesn\u2019t have to be defensive about her person. She has been a sweet girl in the shelter, but timid. She\u2019s very zoomie and happy in the yard! She has shown some playful interest in other dogs but her past owners said she wasn\u2019t good with them so a careful meet and greet would be a necessity.  Milu would love to be in her own home where she can settle into a routine. \n\nAGE\n2 year\n\nHEALTH\nSpayed, vaccine, microchip\n\nGOOD IN A HOME WITH\nOther dogs, probably no kids\n.\nInterested in Milu?

I live to please, but I wasn\u2019t fully socialized growing up so I get confused by new people. I am told that I need a home where the humans have experience with dogs and will be willing to work with me everyday. Once I warm up to you, I am a lover and a snuggler but will need to be introduced to people slowly and in structured environments. I promise that I am a good boy. I just need some extra special love.

Marin is 5 years old and cat tolerant with supervision. Her pictures do not do her justice in the cold and dusk.

She loves to cuddle and give lots of kisses. She is great with people, warms up to strangers fast, and is good with kids. She is a great hiking and running partner. She loves to wear clothes and snuggle up in blankets. She knows commands like sit, wait, come, quiet, off, and place. She is a pit bull terrier mix. Black and white. About two years old and up to date on all of her shots/vaccinations. She is spayed. \n \nDespite all of these wonderful qualities she does have a problem with other dogs. I did not know that she was dog aggressive when I got her but found out after the fact. Over the weekend she got into a serious fight with my mom's dog. They had met many times before and had been together all day with no issues. Both dogs are okay, Phish only has minor lacerations around her face. The other dog has more severe injuries but is doing just fine. \n \nIf I were living alone or if she was the only dog I would keep her for sure. However, my sister has a dog and after a lot of discussions between her and Phish's trainer I came to the decision that it would be best to find her a new home where she can be the only dog.\"\n\nPlease fill out our adoption application and we will forward it to Phish's owner for them to contact you. https://2ndchance.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=16470780",

But once I settle in, I\u2019m mostly a homebody and enjoy being around my people (I sometimes whine when I can\u2019t see my favorite people, but not for too long!). I\u2019m good about sleeping in my crate at night and am fully potty trained! I\u2019m a little 10 lb couch potato that doesn\u2019t like being left alone. I am also not a fan of loud noises (we\u2019re all scared of something). I\u2019ve been called an escape artist so a close eye in the yard would be a great thing for me. Mostly I love to snuggle on my people\u2019s laps and soak up some attention. I am not a fan of cats, but big dogs I get along with. In my short time here, I\u2019ve only been around older kids and adults but am open to meeting some littles, at my own pace of course.\n\nDo you think I would be a good fit for your home?

Born in January 2019, this boy arrived in our care when his owner developed health complications and could no longer care for him.\n\nFranky is very shy. So far, he has not shown us much of his personality. He will need a patient owner who will take things slow with him and help him come out of his shell. Franky needs a securely fenced-in yard. He should not live in a home with children, although he may do well with a calm dog friend. Franky is housetrained.\n\nWill you provide Franky with a loving place to call home?

Quiet time is the best time. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take up too much space. I am only 10 pounds even though I am already 9 years old. Sometimes I get a little confused about how I am supposed to let you know that I need to go to the bathroom. I do a good job for the most part but will occasionally forget to let my people know, and then I can\u2019t hold it in any longer. I do well with other dogs as long as they are not too hyper. Kids are probably in the same boat. If you have a warm, cozy home for me, please apply at https://www.lucky7dogrescue.com/adoptabledogs",

            "description": "\"Howdy! Have you ever seen a dog as adorable as me?! Can you believe I\u2019m homeless and am waiting for a wonderful person or family to adopt me? Great dogs like me end up in animal shelters every day- I know, it\u2019s so hard to believe but it\u2019s true!\n\nMy name is Jax, and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center from North Carolina. I'm around 7 years old, about 17 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nI'm currently staying with a foster family and enjoying the company of my foster siblings. They are helping me build my confidence. I would love a home with another doggy roommate. My ideal home would have a fenced in yard as I have not had a lot of exposure to the world, so I'm a bit apprehensive of it, so a suburban home might would suit me best. I'm hoping to work on my leash skills without lots of distractions. If you have children in the home, I would do best with older children that are about 15 years old or older.\n\nMy foster mom has the following to say about me:\n\"Jax is a super sweet dog. He loves his naps. He was nervous in the beginning but once he knows he is safe, he settled right in. He is very food motivated. His leash skills are progressing. The harness really helps! He has also done well with our cat!\"\n\nThe staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! If you are interested in me, please complete an adoption profile (found here: https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) and email it to my friends at foster@providenceac.org. I can't wait to hear from you! XOXO Jax\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

            "description": "Scrappy is a very special senior boy. He is about 11 years old. He was surrendered to the shelter due to some unknown medical issues. Our vet determined that he had oral cancer. He has recently undergone surgeries at a specialty vet hospital to remove part of his lower jaw to remove the cancer. They believe that he has a very good prognosis for a healthy life moving forward based on the surgeon\u2019s assessment and his pathology report. He has an eight week follow up appointment scheduled in early March and has been healing nicely. He eats and drinks very well, though his tongue does stick out and he does drool a lot. He is a messy eater due to missing some of his lower jaw, and requires a little help getting cleaned up after meals. \n\nWe very lovingly refer to Scrappy as our grumpy old man. He is very grumbly and vocal, but he does warm up eventually and loves to be part of the pack. He\u2019s currently living in a foster home with two small older dogs and a toddler and he is doing well getting along with everyone. He enjoys spending time out in the yard and likes riding in the car and going for walks. \n\nBeing a standard dachshund, he does struggle with multiple stairs and needs to be carried up and down. He is able to hop up and down one or two steps. His current diet consists of wet canned prescription food (Hill\u2019s I/D or Purina EN). This has been prescribed in order to meet his mouth care needs and also to alleviate some digestion and gastrointestinal issues he was having. He has done much better on the prescription food and hasn\u2019t had any further issues since starting on the prescription food. \n\nScrappy will need an adoptive family who will be patient with him and his needs and who will take their time letting him slowly settle in.",

They couldnt care for him any longer and wanted him to have a loving home.\nPaco's mom is a german shepherd mix and not sure of Dads breed.  He is a year old and will need to be neutered soon. Paco is large in size and has a handsome cream coat with black marking. He looks like a dutch shepherd to us. \nHe is a little shy yet but warmed up with a few treats and sweet talk.\nBetter photos to follow soon  Paco was around little children in the past and did well.

I am house-trained, but still working on my puppy manners. My foster Mom says I like exploring the yard and don't mind having my nails done or ears cleaned. I can be competitive with other dogs - so I will do best with a confident dog sibling or as a single dog with lots of canine friends. An attentive and active forever home is where I'd like to be. If you are interested in adding me to your family - I mean, just look at my beautiful face - please complete the application found on hsnb.org/adoptions. My fee is $300. Thank you!!

He\u2019s a 64 pound snuggler who\u2019s had a difficult past so he\u2019s getting used to eating on a schedule, BUT, he is potty trained! While his basic commands could use some honing, he loves playing outside and going on walks. He also enjoys some quiet time to explore his surroundings. Being 3 years old, Bentley is a pretty mellow boy, who doesn\u2019t bark too much. An ideal home would be patient with training and allow Bentley to get comfortable with his new surroundings and experiences. Smaller children may not be ideal for this potential buddy as he does have some power and could knock them over. He doesn\u2019t have any experience with cats but other dogs are a-ok with him.

My vision and hearing are impaired, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am not awesome.. I learn my way around a new space fairly quickly- but I am requesting a home with older children (if any) and no staircases unless they are securely barricaded. Safety first... and treats second, please! I love my snacks. I am not much for playtime, but I live with other little doggies and kitties. We get along just fine. \n\nI get a little jumpy, so approaching me slowly is much appreciated. I am a quiet guy, but I do enjoy my peoples\u2019 company- so if I am alone for an extended period, you may hear about it. Cuddling on your lap isn\u2019t really my forte, but in a relaxed environment I will certainly plop down next to you.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to navigate doors, so housetraining may require the use of pads in a regular location. Patience and routine guided trips to the area would be most helpful. I would love to be the chill buddy in your quiet home. If you think you would be a good fit apply at www.lucky7dogrescue.com/applynow",

This doll had our hearts from the moment she arrived at SAVE as a stray pooch. Unfortunately, no owner ever came forward to claim her, so now she is on the search for her forever home. Priscilla is a sweet and petite little pup who warms up more with each day that she's here. She appears to have a medium energy level - she likes to zoom around in our fenced-in yard, play fetch, and go for walks in the park with our volunteers. She also loves to snuggle up to her people after she's done playing. Priscilla would thrive in a home where she can be the princess of the house and your heart (aka no other pets or children). She needs a little time to warm up to new people, but boy oh boy will this little lady steal your heart! \n\nPlease note: Due to high volume, email inquiries will not be returned. Please go to our website, complete an online application (if you haven't already) and indicate which animal(s) you are interested in. Once approved, you will be contacted to schedule an adoption appointment. Kindly call the shelter if you have any questions at 609-309-5214.\n Primary Color: Tan Weight: 44lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

Frankly, nobody should be surprised considering I lived the first 8 years of my life in the south and only weigh 10 pounds. I am still getting used to a lot of things up here in the north. I am not a fan of my collar and try to slip out of it, leashes are the scariest thing I have ever seen, and please don\u2019t pick me up unless it\u2019s necessary. I am a dignified, independent lady. I spend my days perched on the couch watching everything and will give you love on my terms. Speaking of love - I am a huge fan of other dogs. I would love to have a sibling to play with and keep me company. I also really like spending time with my foster family. I let them know how much I miss them when I can\u2019t see them by howling my sorrows. As my foster family says, I am the perfect companion for having a glass of wine and reading. I may not be able to actually read with you as my sight and hearing are not as good as they used to be, but I am super chill and will love being with you. I just need a little time to adjust to all these changes. Would you be willing to give this experienced lady a second chance? I promise to love you forever. If you think you can provide me with a safe and patient home, please apply at https://www.lucky7dogrescue.com/adoptabledogs",

This pet is  , up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heart-worm negative, and micro-chipped! \n\nDarcy is a happy go lucky gal that loves her dog companions as much as she loves her human companions. Darcy does like to nap, but she still gets the zoomies like any young puppy does! Her foster mom did a dog DNA test and discovered she is mostly Blue Tick Coonhound, but she also has equal parts Australian Cattle Dog, Corgi, and Weimaraner. These are all active breeds and for that reason, Darcy will do best with an active family that will take her on adventures \u2013 she would love to be a hiking or running buddy. \n\nDarcy lives with all of her littermates, as well as two other puppies and several big dogs. She also lives with two cats in here foster home. She has done great with everyone. So far, she has very little interest in the cats and loves to play with the dogs, but she\u2019s also really good at entertaining herself with dog toys and running laps around the backyard. Darcy hasn\u2019t been around kids, but her foster mom doesn\u2019t have any concern with her being with kids. Like any puppy, she may have to be taught appropriate boundaries with kids, but she is a gentle girl that takes direction extremely well. \n\nSometimes Darcy will sit and watch her foster mom almost as if she is waiting for direction. For this reason, her foster mom believes she is extremely intelligent and will be a super easy dog to train. She has started going outside, but will need work on potty training and kennel training. She stays in a penduring the day and at night with her littermates, so when she is adopted, she will need a little time to adjust to being on her own; it will be a big change for her. \n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt this pet at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application!",

Thankfully, Moonbeam and Silver were found by caring forestry workers who fostered them for a week until they found rescue for them.\n\nMoonbeam (36 lbs) and Silver (42 lbs) are lab mixes. Silver looks as if he may have some Weimaraner in him. They are young, maybe a year old. They love to do labby things -- play ball, frisbee and tug, find sticks and try to catch moles and chipmunks. They appear to be housebroken and know basic commands. Moonbeam is very outgoing, Silver is more cautious upon first meeting, but yummy treats win him over. They seem to warm up to men more quickly. These two have been through a lot, so we would like to find them a home together if possible to keep some continuity in their lives. If we can't find a home where they can stay together, we will send them to separate homes. Silver definitely requires the companionship of another dog. Moonbeam might be okay as an only dog. If you'd like to meet Moonbeam and Silver, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\nGreater Cincinnati area adopters only please. All of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nMOONBEAM (female, black and white) and SILVER (male, shiny grey coat) are beautiful young lab mix siblings found abandoned in a campground. Thankfully, Moonbeam and Silver were found by caring forestry workers who fostered them for a week until they found rescue for them.\n\nMoonbeam (36 lbs) and Silver (42 lbs) are lab mixes. Silver looks as if he may have some Weimaraner in him. They are young, maybe a year old. They love to do labby things -- play ball, frisbee and tug, find sticks and try to catch moles and chipmunks. They appear to be housebroken and know basic commands. Moonbeam is very outgoing, Silver is more cautious upon first meeting, but yummy treats win him over. They seem to warm up to men more quickly. These two have been through a lot, so we would like to find them a home together if possible to keep some continuity in their lives. If we can't find a home where they can stay together, we will send them to separate homes. Silver definitely requires the companionship of another dog. Moonbeam might be okay as an only dog. If you'd like to meet Moonbeam and Silver, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\nGreater Cincinnati area adopters only please. All of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

This boy is submissive and love to play! His ideal home will be one where he has some property to play on. Blu was cat tested and ignored the sweet kitty. He can likely be in a home with a cat :-).

This breed is known for being protective, capable, fearless, and determined. On the other hand, these dogs are also described as docile, friendly, and affectionate. They are not at all aggressive or aloof- quite the contrary. Keep in mind that these dogs like to chew a lot, so you should give your pooch a variety of bones and toys that are safe to chew. Giving your pet plenty of toys to play with while spending time indoors will also keep him mentally stimulated so boredom won't lead to unwanted behaviors. Winnie is housebroke and crate trained, she is good with other dogs and cats. At this time because she just came to us and and we are unfamiliar with her behavior towards children, people, eating, playing. Once she is evaluated further we will update her web page accordingly. We were told from her previous owner that he felt Winnie might have been abused at one time in her life. She does not like broom sticks or any kind of stick. Two of the family members in the home were male, tall and skinny, Winnie did not respond well to them. We will evaluate this. She is scared of fireworks, skate boards. She is good with women.\nRight now she is fitting in great with all the people coming in and out at the rescue and all the dogs barking. Sh seems very quiet.",

He does have some nerve damage in the foot. His left leg is better and able to bend but not 100%.\nFord continues to be a trooper through all his procedures and the healing process.

I was saved with embedded collar injuries to my neck and have been recuperating from them, but finally ready to find my forever family. I am an American bully, about 3 years old, and a happy boy who loves attention. I love to go on my walks with my Foster mama and have been working on my potty training with her. I am looking for a loving family that has a big yard, so I can continue my potty training. My biggest difficulty has been that I am afraid to go potty in public, but my rescue peeps think I would do great in a home where I could go party within the confines of an enclosed yard. I love cuddles and snuggles. I have also worked on my obedience and have learned to walk well on lead with the use of a gentle leader. I am looking for a family that will love me forever. Will that be you?",

In the last three weeks, I've had a lot of firsts:\n\n\n\tfirst time outside\n\tfirst time on a leash\n\tfirst time on a walk\n\tfirst time bathrooming outside\n\tfirst time watching a video conference with intense fascination \n\n\nIt's been a lot of new stuff to learn, but I'm told I'm progressing really well. I love dogs of all sizes and I'm learning how to play, but am still learning to be calm around humans of all sizes. When I see a new one, I want to run away and hide. Always flight, no fight.\n\nI'm comfortable laying on a dog bed on the floor next to my foster parents and following them around the house, but I'm not ready to be pet or cuddled. I've taken to potty training really well, but I still need some potty pads in the home while I'm leash training. I'm looking for a real special adopter who can exercise a lot of patience, understanding, and training, cause my rehab will take some time, but I'll give you lots of smiles and nose pokes while we're working on it together. \n\nI like collecting fluff toys and nomming on antlers. I love peanut butter and rolling around in the fresh snow. I think I'd be most comfortable somewhere with a fence to play freely and a confident dog friend to learn from.",

I will need someone who is patient with me and will allow me time to open up, yet will also push me be social. I'm a girl who doesn't know what she wants. I do enjoy being cozy in my bed and watching my foster humans do human things. I am fine with other animals, as long as they respect my space. I am potty pad trained and am not trusted to go outside right now. One 10 day adventure got me black listed from the outdoors. My foster mom said once I learn to walk on a leash I'll be allowed out again. \nIf you're open to giving me a chance, I'll be open to giving you a chance.",

She will definitely need a job, such as corralling toys or keeping an eye on the kids. A fenced in yard or a farm would make Luna very happy!\n\n\n\nIf you have any doggie friends in your life, please be sure to bring them with you and staff will set up a meet to make sure everyone gets along.

Bingo is a people type of person-I mean dog- who just wants to be with his furever family! In his previous home he lived both indoors and outdoors and was completely potty trained, he loves to play with rubber balls, and is a PRO at playing fetch. This young boy may be rambunctious and playful but he's also booksmart and knows the verbal cues \"sit\", \"come\" and \"stay\"! While Bingo has been around children before, and he LOVED THEM, he plays very rough. If you have children in the home, keep in mind what their comfort level is with dogs. Bingo would LOVE to meet them here first before coming home with you!\n\nBingo is a boy of refine taste, and if there are any other pets in the home would prefer that they are around his size or larger. If you do have another large dog he asks that you bring them for a doggie date to make sure they are compatible before adopting! \n\nCome meet Bingo at KCCAC today",

I am currently 45 pounds and have sadly been in two crowded southern shelters just waiting for my perfect family. Luckily, when my time was near, the Humane Society scooped me up and brought me here until I could find the best home possible! So far, I have showed how spunky and fun I am. I have played well with dogs both small and large and did wonderfully! I will be cat tested soon. As for children, the shelter staff believe I will be best with sturdy kids. My zoomies could easily knock over a child. I would also do best in a house rather than an apartment. My energy is fun and booming, so keep that in mind when adopting me. I am very friendly and love going for walks. If you are looking for a hiking buddy, I would be perfect too! if you would like to add me to your home, please fill out an application and schedule a time to come meet me!",

I don't tear anything up or cause any messes. My foster sister is a female dog, and we get along beautifully.\nIm a huge, 140 lb cuddle bug and would love a forever home with you. \nMy back legs are a tiny bit sensitive, as with most large breed dogs, so please be mindful of those. \nOther than that, I am in great health, and still love to play and romp around! \nI look forward to meeting you very soon. \nLove, Norman",

This friendly giant loves people and is excited about life. River knows some commands (such as \"sit) and responds well to leash steering. He is also crate- and house-trained. River loves treats, and he should be a quick learner. \n \nRiver's ideal family is someone who can handle his enviable muscles, as River is a strong boy. He would do best in a home without small children, other dogs, or senior adults for this same reason.\n \nThere is no better way to start 2021 than with River. His zest for life and love will bring joy to a lucky family.\n\nSponsored by Brian McNeill",

Charlie is truly a gentleman! He\u2019s great on a leash \u2013 although if he needs to stop for a potty break, he may pull a little. Charlie is well behaved when home alone \u2013 his foster has never needed to put him in a crate. Miss Manners herself would have few critiques for this guy!\n\nSweet as sugar! Charlie\u2019s favorite activity? Being loved on! He\u2019s an affectionate guy who is happy to be wherever you are. His second favorite activity? Running. But only if you\u2019re there, he\u2019ll love you too much too run away!\n\nCharlie is everything you want in a gentleman, and you\u2019re everything he wants in a human!\n",

My life, along with some of my siblings, started out a bit rough but on the right track for an awesome life.  I love playing with my siblings and the other dogs in my foster home are pretty cool too.  My foster humans are showing me the snuggles are one of the greatest things besides those things they call toys.  I'm ready to get moving on to my wonderful loving life.  \n\nI will come with the works (Neutered/Spayed, up to date on everything, micro chipped, fecal, heartworm tested if age appropriate, heartworm, flea and tick preventative, one month insurance and free vet visit).  What more could a new family ask for?  COVID 19 restrictions:  If I have not been altered by adoption I will have to return to my vet for my procedure.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and thinking about adoption, please visit our website http//www.wagginghearts.org and submit an adoption application. Include the name(s) of the animal(s) you are interested in the subject line of the email. Due to the high volume of applications we receive we are only able to process fully completed applications. We do not reply to inquiries. Since we are a foster based rescue we are unable to set up meet and greets until a completed application is on file and has been approved. \n\nWagging Hearts is a 100% foster-based, non-profit rescue organization. \n\nOur mission is to rescue abandoned, neglected, and stray companion animals. Please visit http//www.wagginghearts.org if you would like to adopt and provide a forever home to one in need.",

Hes interested in everything going on around him and can be independent, going off on the occasional bold adventure. Then hell cuddle with his people, play with his brother or the big dogs (all the other dogs seem HUGE when youre this size), and settle in for a nap.\n\nSnirt is hearing and vision impaired so hes learning touch commands to navigate his world. Right now, that means lots of playing, eating, and running through his tunnel with his favorite ball. But the very best play time is wrestling and chewing on toys. Hed love a home with a fenced-in yard for safe adventures where an active family will keep things fun. It would be great if theres another dog for playing because Snirt adores all animals.\n\nHed love a home with a fenced-in yard for safe adventures where an active family will keep things fun. It would be great if theres another dog for playing because Snirt adores all animals. Snirt is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped, and current on heartworm/flea and tick prevention. Also included in his adoption is a Fi GPS collar and one year of GPS service subscription. If he were to escape, as soon as he leaves the safe zone you set around your home, you are alerted so that you can find Snirt's whereabouts. Youll also be able to see how many steps per day he takes to ensure he gets the right amount of exercise, alongside many other features to explore in the Fi mobile app.",

Abandoned in a home when her family moved away, she was confused and heartbroken, making her transition at Sarasota County Animal Services very difficult. Kila was very scared and did not show her true personality well so SCAS reached out to Satchel's for help. Kila can be timid at first but food is the key to her heart. Give her a couple cookies and she may only have eyes for you. She is an easy walker and is very attentive. She does enjoy playing with toys and will show her goofball side when she is comfortable. She seems to be okay with both cats and other dogs. Give her a chance and she is sure to melt your heart. Kila is estimated to be 2 years old and weighs approximately 50 lbs.",

He is learning leash manners and doing great but will need someone with a fenced in yard or time to work with him on training. He is very treat motivated and just wants to please! We are not sure how he is with other dogs but he seems to be a bit selective with them so a home without other dogs might be best. If you are interested in meeting Julius, the Humane Society at Lakewood Ranch is open Friday through Sunday 11:00 - 4:00. Any questions, contact us at info@hslwr.org. This is the source to for more information. Thank You!",

I am working on my house breaking and crate training and I am good with other dogs, cats, and children. Won't you give me my forever home?Thank you for your interest in our adoptable pet. Please note that while we do our best to describe the pet in detail, some items such as breed and age can be \"\"best guesses\"\" since many of our animals come in without previous records. RAIN does not guarantee size of our animals at adult age nor will we guarantee breeds of animals.",

I've got a purple dot because I can be very protective over my food and treats, so I need to be in a home with an experienced dog owner, and no children, please! My friends here at HSSC have been working very hard with me to correct this behavior, and I'm now able to trade food and possessions for treats, but I will need to go home with someone who understands my behavior and is committed to continuing my training at home so that I don't revert. I can be a little picky with treats, but so far my favorite is cheese! I'm not too interested in toys, I'd much rather go for a long walk followed by a nap on the couch. If you're an active person and you understand my behavior, please come to see me! Maybe you'll fall in love!\n\nWhat's HW+? I'm currently being treated for heartworms. I'll need to keep a calm lifestyle until finished and may require an appointment or two. Please don't be deterred, my lifespan isn't shortened, and I'm not contagious to your other pets.\n\nTake me on a Slumber Party! You can bring me home for a 3 day - 30 day trial period. HSSC will provide food, medications, and necessities. If I'm not the one for you, just bring me back to HSSC and provide feedback on what would be the best home for me.",

He has a goofy, loveable personality and aims to please people. He was surrendered by his owners who sadly tied him to a chain for the first few years of his life. He can be protective so he would do best in a home where he is the only dog. He is very energetic, his favorite activity is to have zoomies in the yard. He is up-to-date on vaccines, heartworm negative and has been a healthy boy overall. He would make an incredible companion.",

Unfortunately Nikki came in to rescue already pregnant too. On Christmas Eve she gave birth to 5 healthy puppies. Nikki is the most loving little girl. She loves belly rubs, chew toys and sunning on the patio. She gets along great with her foster siblings, and is great with children too. She has impeccable house manners and hardly barks. Nikki won\u2019t be ready for adoption until she can be spayed, which will be about 12 weeks after delivery. She is such a good mommy to her babies that were all named for the cold day they were born on. Stay tuned! Introductions will be soon for Paloma, Lumi, Neve, Cole and Crystal.\n",

I can't wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area.

I was just rescued by Second City Canine Rescue  and I'm now in a loving foster home waiting for my forever family to find me! Please come soon... I can't wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

I can't wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area.

She is deaf but she doesn't let that slow her down.  She loves attention and may enjoy play time once she understands her new peoples routines.  She is affectionate and lower energy. We recommend that she not be placed in a home with children as deaf dogs can be startled very easily. \n\nPlease note:\n\nAt this time, our dog kennels are open for general visitation without a prior appointment. We will, however, be limiting the number of persons in the kennel area at one time, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nVisits with cats and/or critters still require that an appointment be made in advance. To schedule your appointment, please call us at (703) 792-6465, or email us at animalshelter@pwcgov.org.\n\nAll persons will be required to wear a face mask when visiting the PWC Animal Shelter. This requirement complies with Governor Ralph Northam's Executive Order No.63 (https://bit.ly/2AnqGXd).",

She has been stressed & barking in her kennel, but she\u2019s such a good girl when you get her out in the yard. She is actually a bit timid. She likes to run & play.  She is also a kisser once she gets to know you & she decides you are \u201ckissable \u201c.  Look at her expressive ears & eyes! \n\nZoe is sponsored!  Adoption fee is $50, fully vetted.  Visitors welcomed Tuesday - Saturday 11AM - 3PM. Appointments not needed, but please bring your masks to wear. Adoption applications available at the shelter after you 've visited and if you've made a love connection. \n\n\n*****\nIf don't have room in your home but do have room in your heart, you can help one of our homeless pets find a home of its own by sponsoring them. By sponsoring, you will be paying part of the adoption fee, making it possible for them to be adopted much sooner. \n            \nFor Adoption or Sponsorship  Information please call 270-586-3125.  \nADOPTION HOURS:  Tuesday - Saturday 11 am to 3 pm Central Time. Adoption Fee for our dogs is $95.  All dogs will be adopted fully vetted.  Spay/Neuter.  Wormed.  Heartworm tested and heartworm preventative administered.

            "description": "Life has not been kind to sweet Zoe but that is all about to change.  She\u2019s the perfect example of why no one should adopt a dog on a whim.  Zoe was purchased as a small puppy but her family soon grew tired of her.  They left her alone outside in the backyard and seldom paid any attention to her.  She never went to the vet and sometimes they neglected to feed her.  In fact, she didn\u2019t even have a name!  Fortunately, Zoe had a special friend that was watching over her.  Fate stepped in and she was able to convince Zoe\u2019s family to surrender her to our care.  Her rescuer told us she named her \u201cZoe\u201d because it means \u201clife\u201d; the wonderful new life this special dog deserved in the arms of a loving family.\nZoe is a two and half year old Siberian Husky and absolutely stunning!  She can be shy at first because she is not used to meeting new people.  Once you gain her trust, she\u2019s quite loving and friendly.  A large playful pup, she is so starved for affection and attention.  She weighs fifty-seven pounds and sometimes can knock you over with her enthusiastic love.  Zoe means no harm but could be too much for little children or seniors.  She needs someone that enjoys an active lifestyle and can handle a large strong dog.  Zoe needs plenty of exercise including daily walks or long runs.  She is working on her leash skills and learning not to pull.  \nZoe will make a wonderful companion but is a little rough around the edges.  With a little patience and time, Zoe will quickly learn to curb her enthusiasm.  She is exceptionally smart and eager to please.  She will learn new obedience skills quickly.  Zoe has not lived in a house before and will need close supervision until she is trained.  She prefers going on grass and will need a tall securely fenced in backyard.  Before coming to the shelter, Zoe has no exposure to cats and only to other dogs through a fence.  We have been slowly introducing her to other large playful dogs and she has done well.  If you currently own a dog, we can arrange a meet and greet to see if they are compatible.  \nZoe\u2019s first few years haven\u2019t been so great.  Will you help to make sure the rest of her life is spectacular?!  She\u2019s really quite special and we promised to find her a fabulous home.  \n\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

She gets along with other dogs but does have a rough play style.  Fern loves toys and playing fetch, hiking and walks well on leash. She is mostly house broken but does need reminding. She is also crate trained. Fern requires a secure fenced yard.  And, no apartments/condos for this girl. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur adoption fee of $250.00 helps cover expenses (vaccinations, microchips, spay/neuter, food, housing) for the homeless pets we rescue.  UAF does NOT ship or adopt our adoptables out of state (Arizona) and to ensure the best fit, UAF conducts a home visit to meet other pets and verify a safe, secure yard.\n\nTo start the process of adopting this dog or any other dog, please fill out our matchmaking form which can be accessed by copying the following address and pasting it into your browser.  Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/index.php?option=com_rsform&view=rsform&formId=2\n\nPlease email uafdogs@gmail.com to learn more about this dog.",

            "description": "ODEN.  This boy once he sniffs you out and decides you are a \u201ckeeper\u201d, he will speed wag his tail and give you all the lovins.  When you pet him, he will close his eyes and savor the moment.  Oden loves adult humans, children and dogs.  Oden dislikes ALL cats so there cannot be any cats in the home. \n\n****More information from Oden's previous owner: Oden will be 1 in February. He is house broken, crate trained. He is great with children, no matter the age. He is great with other dogs, and humans. He just isn\u2019t good with cats, even after trying a year to socialize and change this behavior. He is an inside dog and still in puppy phase. He loves car rides, and walks great on a harness. He is very vocal. He loves playing fetch and running around. Always kept up to date on shots and flea medicine. He is a very good dog.  Oden had a double hematoma in his ears when he was a puppy. This was surgically corrected. If bathing him, it is imperative to make sure no water gets in his ears.*****\n\nOden is vocal. He will talk / bark at you when you get around his kennel.  Don\u2019t let that put you off - many dogs will do that in a shelter environment.  Get him out in the yard , let him smell the air (& you) and see if you have a love connection with him like I did.  \n\n\nOden is sponsored! His adoption fee is $50, fully vetted.  Visitors welcomed Tuesday - Saturday 11AM - 3PM. Appointments not needed, but please bring your masks to wear. Adoption applications available at the shelter after you 've visited and if you've made a love connection. \n\n\n*****\nIf don't have room in your home but do have room in your heart, you can help one of our homeless pets find a home of its own by sponsoring them. By sponsoring, you will be paying part of the adoption fee, making it possible for them to be adopted much sooner. \n            \nFor Adoption or Sponsorship  Information please call 270-586-3125.  \nADOPTION HOURS:  Tuesday - Saturday 11 am to 3 pm Central Time. Adoption Fee for our dogs is $95.  All dogs will be adopted fully vetted.  Spay/Neuter.  Wormed.  Heartworm tested and heartworm preventative administered.   Upon adoption, monthly preventative medications are available at a discounted rate.  \n",

She made sure I had sweaters to keep me warm, lots of toys to play with, a cool cave bed, and lots of blankets. She was wonderful! But, then she started having some health problems and was no longer able to care for me, so she made the VERY difficult decision to let WAAL find me a new forever home . . . one which we know she'd approve of. So, here I am, a loving and trusting girl just looking for a new place to call home. I still have my cave bed, and apparently the way I cuddle in it's pretty funny. That, and how I snore. Yeah . . . I snore a little. Number one thing to know about me? I LOVE being with my people! I am smart, and know \"come\" and \"stay,\" and am quickly learning about this thing called \"crate training;\" apparently I'm getting pretty good at it. Other dogs are cool, but I haven't met any of those kitty creatures. They might be cool, too. If you have a loving heart and plenty of time to spend with me ('cause I want to spend lots of time with you), fill out an application so we can meet! ...",

I am a friendly boy and I love to meet new people and play with other dogs. I have medium to high energy and love to run around and play. I would be best in an all-adult home and my opinions on cats are currently unknown. I would be the perfect fit for an experienced dog owner who knows how to harness my energy and size and I can't think of anything that would make me happier than having access to a great big yard to run around and play in. I would be very happy in a busy home with lots going on and I love to get new visitors. I would benefit from some continued training, as I am not quite potty-trained yet and I tend to pull on the leash, but I know that I can get the hang of it in no time!",

He is about 1-2 years old with a stunning fawn coat. He loves riding shotgun and is a good mid-sized pal about 48 lbs, built for more active adventures as well as cuddles on the couch. Overall, Micah is just a happy, friendly guy towards people and dogs alike. He is happy to have landed himself on the farm and is enjoying his time here, but would REALLY love to find a place and people of his very own. To meet Micah, please submit your adoption request at savinggracenc.org\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

He would probably do best with older kids too. Duke is an absolute bouncy ball of a dog. Keep him busy and he will keep you entertained! Duke is a very happy guy that enjoys meeting new people. He can be adopted by applying at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Tallinn, a 14 lb, 10 week old Lab mix puppy, is an absolute sweetheart. Like many of the dogs rescued from the South he was not a big fan of the cold weather when he first got here. The arrival of the recent snow quickly changed his mind, and he thoroughly enjoyed the strange new experience. Tallinn is a playful and curious puppy, and while he may initially approach new people and situations cautiously, it doesn't take long for him to enthusiastically jump in with all 4 paws. Snuggling and ear rubs are some of his favorite pastimes, and he loves being around people. He is a calm and easy going companion, and will happily accompany his foster family as they go about their daily lives, whether it is doing errands in the car or relaxing on his bed while listening to soothing music. Tallinn is an active little guy, but he also enjoys quietly playing with his toys, fetching a ball or chewing a bone.\n\nCurrently weighing in at 14 pounds, we expect Tallinn to grow to about 55-65 pounds. He is doing extremely well with house training and basic obedience and leash skills. He savors his treats and is eager to please, so he should be a highly motivated learner and quickly understand good house manners and appropriate behaviors. Once this little cutie pie finds his way into your life he will captivate your heart, and every day with him will be joyous!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Bennett has adorable little freckles on his nose! Around 3 months old, this cutie is a Pit Bull Terrier mix. He is currently being treated for an injured foot but should be back to running around and playing in no time! Bennett came in without a mom or dad so we aren't sure his breed mix or how big he will get but currently we expect Bennett to be medium to large when grown. Bennett's favorite activity is cuddling with his foster family. He wins over everyone he meets, including the kitty in his foster home. They love to play together. Bennett is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application.

She is active for her age. Ms. Cha Cha is medium energy and will be happy with moderate amounts of daily exercise. She does like to play with some toys. Loves to be with her human and would not do well in apartment setting as she is a barker. Would do best in home of her own but does tolerate small dogs. Are you looking for a beautiful golden Diva who will plant herself on your lap and claim you as hers? Then fill out an application today and let's get this sweet girl a home.Please note we do not have a central kennel facility, all of our pets are located in foster homes. The first step in meeting one of our furry friends is to fill out an application on our website at <a href=''www.rainbowrescues.org''>www.rainbowrescues.org</a>. A volunteer will be in contact with you in 1-2 business days to review your application and speak with you about the adoption process. Our adoption fees at this time are $250 for Adult dogs, $300 for puppies (6 months and under), $100 for senior dogs, $100 for cats, and a $50 fee for small animals. **Please be aware that we are not responsible for inaccurate information on some cross-posted sites such as inaccurate adoption fees and inaccurate pet info.**",

Unfortunately, my owner passed away and I didn't have anyone that I could stay with so that's how I ended up with these humans. I have been around other dogs, cats and do well with kids. I am not a fan of crates, so I will need to be in a home where I am allowed to roam the house as I please. I do well in my kennel as far as being potty trained and not chewing things up, so I promise I will be good in my new home. I am a larger guy, weighing a little over 90 pounds, but do mind well on the leash. I would do well placed in a more quiet home as a lot of activity can spook me. I am scheduled to be neutered and am up to date on vaccines and prevention.",

Saul is quite timid and therefore would do best in a quiet home with a confident dog to show him the ropes and no children in the home. Saul will need socialization and training to allow him to be brave in this world of new noises and experiences. He's only 2 months old and needs to stay close to the Des Moines metro to finish vetting. His adoption fee is $250. Apply at www.foreverhomedogs.org to meet Saul!All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. \n\nSenior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

            "description": "If you're looking for a canine love bug, look no further. Eva is a pretty 4-year-old friendly pooch that is generous with her heart and wet kisses. Dog lovers know how loyal their four-footed friends can be and when you open your home to a rescue, their gratitude can be off the charts. Won't you consider a meet-and-greet with Eva? This sweet girl may want to be the only pet. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received. All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

At 8 Years Old, he is ready to find a home where he can live out his golden years. Henry is great with people and other dogs and were pretty sure he wouldnt mind cats too. Henry is about 70 pounds large and currently fostered with another German Shepherd male and a young child. He's a really gentle, easy going boy who is mellow. He's a breeze on a leash and tolerates absolutely everything - you can pet him and touch his paws with no issues! Henry is house trained, and is working on spending some time in his crate, he mostly spends his time napping in the house.",

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Kinston and my brother is Scout. We would love to find a place to spend our golden years. We don't need much, a comfy bed and endless treats and food. Did I mention how much we also love pets, cuddles and attention? We're older and some might say we have peaked but I don't have any less love to give. If you give me a chance I promise you won't be disappointed. We get along with people and kids very well. We're house trained, we can be left alone and we don't cause trouble. We're fairly quiet, though my brother Kingston does beg for food and attention, sometimes he's a little whiney but my foster mom thinks he's charming, whatever that means. We get along with dogs, but energetic or pushy dogs make us tired and we would do best with easy going pups who don't need much from us. We know we're up there in age, but we have so much love to offer you, what do you think, do you have room for us?\n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal. Applications may take up to 48 hours to process.\n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. The adoption fee to adopt them both is $175. If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at http://caws.org/adoption-application.

            "description": "Are you looking for a distinguished older gentleman to warm your bed and couch? Then Mack is your guy! This 8ish year old, 60ish pound guy loves nothing more than lounging around following a nice, long walk. Give him a warm blanket and a good rub (belly and ears, please!), and Mack is in his happy place. Mack is a really good walker, though he needs a strong, confident person at the end of his leash to redirect his attention from strangers and other dogs. Mack knows some commands -- he'll sit and shake on a dime! -- and is working on stay and quiet, as he does like to let you know what's going on outside the house. Mack has a history of getting a little too excited in high energy situations, so he needs a home without small children, small dogs and overly playful, excitable pups.\n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal. Applications may take up to 48 hours to process.\n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $200. If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at http://caws.org/adoption-application If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at https://caws.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Meet Zeke! Located in Bellingham and ready to meet you!\n\nZeke is a gorgeous mixed breed, approx 1.5 year old, approx 68 lbs. We cannot be sure of his breed since he is a rescue, but we think he looks like a border collie mixed with staffordshire terrier/pit bull, possibly. He has a medium length coat, longer than pit bull hair. He has the most adorable features!!\nZeke is fully vetted and the vet says he looks to be in excellent shape! He is a vibrant boy, joyful and playful. \n \n\nZeke absolutely LOVES treats, so he is going to be very trainable! He stands or sits at attention if he thinks you have a treat. This makes training so much easier. He learns new routines and instructions quickly. He is potty trained and crate trained! He cries the first 5 min in crate but then settles. He's getting better and better.\n\nZeke does love to play with other dogs but needs to be matched with dogs close to his size because he gets excited and May be too rough with little ones. Perhaps matching him with a female would be best, or as a single dog with plenty of exercise with his human would be fine too. \n\nNo cats please!\n\nZeke absolutely loves people and loves attention. He will make someone an awesome companion and adventure partner! He does great on leash going for walks. \nHe loves puzzles and games and learning new things. \n \n\nThe adoption fee is $500. He/she is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed/neutered, comes with 6 months of Heartworm preventative, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.)\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to alayna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19753/generic\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

            "description": "Please note: We are a small rescue and do not have the resources to respond to inquiries. If a dog is on our website, it is still available. We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nAdoption fees: $450 for dogs 12 months/younger, $400 for dogs 1-2 Yrs,\n$350 for dogs 3-5yrs, and $300 for 6yrs and older\n\n\nCornelius is a 75lbs, 4 yr old Mastiff mix.\n\nCornelius was surrendered to the shelter on 12/9. His owner had died. He was afraid and it took some work from the volunteers to get him out of his kennel into the yard. The volunteers continually worked with him and he kept improving. Unfortunately, he was set to be put to sleep the week of 1/18. The Stanislaus volunteers came together and CalPaws agreed to take Cornelius in. When we assessed him, we could see he was fearful at first but then warmed up to the people around him. He is curious about other dogs but is fearful at first. Were working with a trainer to get a full assessment. Right now, hes decompressing at a home away from the resident dogs. We took him to a local pet store, where there were no other dogs and he did well with strangers as long as they did not approach him too fast or from behind.\n\nThe perfect home for Cornelius would be a family with older teenage kids who have had dogs before. Cornelius needs to have a large yard for him to do his zoomies and get his energy out. Right now we would have him as an only dog but if a family has their heart set on him and they have another dog, we will have our trainer assess the situation for compatibility.\n\nProbably best with no cats either.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption process and then fill out an online adoption form at https://www.calpaws.org/adopting. Experience with obedience training is definitely required. We are a small rescue and do not have the resources to respond to inquiries. If a dog is our website, it is still available. We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nWe are always in need of fosters for the amount of dogs we have coming in. Being a foster is such a rewarding experience. If you are interested please review https://www.calpaws.org/fostering",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nChino is a friendly 1 year old Staffordshire terrier mix. \n\nChino is a very loving, and friendly boy. He gets along great with people, and other dogs! He loves to go on walks, and adventures! He is all around a wonderful buddy, and companion to have!! He is house and crate trained. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

We first met the volunteers at Friends for Life approximately 4 years ago, when our human found herself homeless. We were quickly adopted (thankfully together) by a wonderful family with a large yard and we were very loved. Our family was recently forced to downsize to an apartment and we weren't doing well in that setting. We are a very bonded pair who have been together our entire lives, and we would love to find a home where we can remain together. We're both house trained and know some commands such as sit and down. If you are our happily ever after, we would be thrilled to meet you!All animals are altered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, licensed (dogs). Cats tested for FELV/FIV. Dogs tested for Heartworm. All animals are available to the first family that is a good match, and if we have more than one animal who is a good match, there will be a lottery for all matches. Note that families must have come in to our adoption center and spoken with an adoption counselor prior to any lottery (when we have lotteries, they usually occur on Saturday mornings).",

She's part Shar-Pei, you guess the rest, but judging from her butt, we can't help but wonder if an armadillo may have crossed her DNA path along the way. This girl is a 54lb lap dog who loves all creatures she comes in contact with. She fosters with multiple dogs and cats, but she hasn't been formally introduced to the cats, so we can't guarantee a pass. She is housetrained, well mannered, highly social and enjoys sun bathing, short excursions around the neighborhood and as many pats as she can get. Jo wasn't in the best of shape when she arrived in our care, but she has made tremendous progress in a few short weeks and continues to improve day by day. Jo needs to lose ~5-7lbs to be at her ideal weight and we are working towards that goal with light but increased exercise every day. She will be scheduled for a dental by end of February and we anticipate she will be ready for her forever home by then.",

But sometimes we think this benefits the dog more then anything, see in his first home there were some younger kids who constantly teased him and poked at him daily, and once he decided to not tolerate it anymore he needed to be gone. So now we feel he would do best in a home with NO KIDS or just in an adult home so he can finally live in peace with no threats anymore. Jocco would you best to be the only pet too. He has now been completely vetted and will be coming to WI now and is hoping to find a real forever home, a home to experience love and happy times. If interested in this cutie an online application can be found at SandiPaws.org\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets.

Her previous home just didn't have the time for her that she needed. Now that she's in a foster home she is starting to open up and show how much of a sweetie she truly is. \nKahlua is just shy of 4 years old and we believe she is a Retriever Mix with her beautiful red/brown, soft, medium length coat and black lips. \nShe has not had any accidents in the house, does great in her crate, good with both cats and dogs and does well with the older children in her foster home. This snuggle bug is a low key gal who loves to play in the snow and cuddle up with her family. If she sounds like the missing piece in your home, fill out an application today!\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc.

Even if a dog is surrendered to us and said to be good with cats there is no way to be sure the dog will be good with your cats.

He would prefer to shine as the only dog in the household.\n\nThe Adoption Process\n\n\n\tIf you are ready to meet the pet, please fill out an online adoption application by copying and pasting the following link into your internet browser: https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/10666/generic\n\tOnce your application is submitted, we will contact the vet reference provided. If you do not yet have a vet, please provide three personal references these could be family and friends who can attest to your pet parenting skills.\n\tA volunteer will schedule a phone interview with you. The interview and application help our fosters find their forever home by ensuring a good match. \n\tThe Louisa Humane Society does not have a brick and mortar facility, so all of our pets are in foster care. Once approved, the foster parent will reach out to arrange a visit. The foster family can tell you all about her likes, dislikes, and little quirks. \n\tThe application and visit do not oblige you to adopt, but if youre ready to take the pet home as your furry forever friend, the adoption fee is $150.",

Playful yet independent, he likes to be around people but will entertain himself, going off to explore on his own. Its always fun wrestling with his brother or chewing on toys. He has a quiet personality and enjoys being cuddled.\n\nYuki is hearing and vision impaired so hes learning touch commands. Because he is food motivated, the learning part is fun. He has a blast running through a toy tunnel and frolickiing in a ball pit. Yuki would love a home with a fenced-in yard, ideally with another dog to play with and a family that is home most of the time to take him on great adventures.Yuki is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped, and current on heartworm/flea and tick prevention. Also included in his adoption is a Fi GPS collar and one year of GPS service subscription. If he were to escape, as soon as he leaves the safe zone you set around your home, you are alertedso that you can find Yuki's whereabouts. Youll also be able to see how many steps per day he takes to ensure he gets the right amount of exercise, alongside many other features to explore in the Fi mobile app.",

Harley was very much loved, but the owner was selfless in surrendering so he can live his best life. He is settling in and I don't think his tail has stopped wagging yet. He gives kisses, loves kids, gets along with other dogs, and loves to play outside! He will get up to date on vaccines next week, but if you want a playful, very sweet addition...he is your man!\n\n \n\nHarley does great on a leash. A fenced yard is not a must have, but because he has lots of energy a fence would be best. He likes other dogs, but is used to be an only dog, so either are fine with him. His only downfall is that he needs to work on his potty training. He just needs the time to get it down!",

I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions!\n\nSapphire is literally the perfect pit. Has all the perfect wrinkles, from his head and cheeks, to his cute little butt. He is personality wise the perfect puppy. Very playful but also super sweet and calm. He is great in a kennel after a treat or two, and with something comfy. Usually covered his kennel with a blanket if he was anxious and he went right to bed. Great about not going potty inside the house already as well! He does do great with his sister as they love to play play play! Usually with the same toy, no matter how many toys there are. Sapphire is just about 9-10 weeks old so has never been on a walk or met a cat yet. Almost any time I sit down he crawls right in my lap. He is a sweet, sweet boy. Sleeps well in his kennel. Would do best in a large fenced in yard or with a park close by to run. Sapphire would do great in a family home, or be a loyal dog for a couple or single person. He is ready to discover the world and find his forever home!!",

The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \nI am part pittie, so I need a single family home. I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pittie restrictions. \n\nI'm as pretty as a flower and as sweet as a bowl of ice cream! I am about 55-65 pounds, 2 yr old grey pitty and my coat has the most beautiful markings. I am the best family gal in the world. I love kids, love to cuddle on the couch or chair with my family. I ended up in a shelter in Texas. I was not happy there at all... Thats when the nice people at DCCR rescued me! One of my favorite things to do is snuggle up close to you and roll around to get belly rubs. I havent been around cats much so unsure there. I am friendly and love most other dogs though! I am a great listener and will follow you from room to room, or just take a nap if your moving around to much. I love to feel part of a family and want to protect you.\n\nOn a leash I can pull and bark at other dogs until I get comfortable with you! Then Im totally fine no pulling, as I love going on walks. I have never had an accident in the house and will go to the door when I need to go out. If you are not paying attention and I really need to go, I will paw at you. I love car rides, soft surfaces, watching TV, windows and squirells and couches. When my foster parent leaves, I get a little anxious in a kennel and do not love to be in one, so they leave me out in the house and I am just fine. When you get home I talk to you and tell you how much I missed you, and show you my toothy grin, dance around and tell you how much I missed you! Cutest thing ever. All around I am the greatest dog ever is what my foster family says. Seriously my foster dad says that I am the sweetest dog best dog ever and they wish they could keep me but they are keeping my daughter!\n\nAre you my new forever family? I would love a home, with a fenced in yard and I guarantee many kisses in exchange for belly rubs!",

She is a Cattle Dog so she does herd other people & pets. She loves to do zoomies and would love a home with a yard where she can have a daily outlet for her energy. Sinead loves nothing more to be around her humans and can be protective of her people, so she will need slow intros to other dogs who approach before she is comfortable. We would not recommend dog parks, daycare, or similiar environments. Sinead hopes to find a quieter, single-family suburban home. She loves being on the dock near the water and would be a great lake dog!\n\nSinead would do best with older kids and teens as she can be anxious around the energy of younger children and will pace. She is crate trained with no barking unless she hears a loud noise and does not have accidents in her crate. Sinead is looking for an adopter who will continue working on her leash skills as she can pull a bit in excitement. She is considered a flight risk as she is curious and has gotten out of fenced areas when off leash.\n\nSinead is a wonderful girl who will make a great addition to her furever family!\n\nAge: 2 yrs\nWeight: 40 lbs.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page. Thank you for your interest in saving a life!",

            "description": "I'm Baby Girl aka 'Girlie, are you my people? I am a seasoned lady who want lots of love and someone to keep me safe. I'm a laid-back sweetheart, very gentle, quiet and kind. I get along with chill dogs, cats and people. I have 3 humans, 2 dogs and 1 cat at my place I'm a lover of food, treats, getting petted, giving hugs, sunning outdoors and chilling. I enjoy hanging out with my 2 doggy brothers and learning how to dog. I love going on walks, exploring my backyard, chew toys and joining you wherever you hang out. I am potty trained, walk well on a leash and know a few commands. Although I will go into a crate, I am well behaved and prefer a comfy doggie bed instead of a crate. I need a family to give me lots of love, take me on walks, and someone to rub my belly at the end of the day. If you think we could be a paw-fect match, fill out an application.

He's very curious and likes to keep tabs on what his humans are up to, and when the opportune moment arises, he'll make sure to nuzzle his head right into your lap for some pets. He may appear a bit on the shy side at first, but if you go slow with him and show him kindness, you will easily gain his trust. Ashtor is a very chill, low maintenance dog who is content being lazy around the house while you work - making him the perfect companion for anyone working from home. He can handle being home alone too, with or without a crate, and has shown to be a quick learner when it comes to figuring out the right place to go potty. He's just as happy to be your buddy for daily walks, despite being a lower energy pup in the house. Once the leash goes on and he gets out the door, he gets so excited to explore the world with you - and it just makes him all the more ready for snuggling downtime later! Sweet Ashtor is just waiting to find his perfect match. Come meet him to see if that could be you!",

She loves to run as fast as she can around the coffee table and then stop abruptly, which is your cue to start chasing her! Riley loves meeting people and is so excited to see them. She is the biggest cuddlebug EVER and likes to be the little spoon when on the couch or in bed. She will always make herself as small as possible to fit however you're sitting or laying. She has a lot of playful energy and her favorite game is chase, and she's also a big fan of rubber toys and bones. She loves going for walks and would be thrilled to have a backyard to romp around in. Riley is fully house-trained and does well in crate, even if she fusses for a brief moment. She also does well free to roam the house as long as all trash/food are put up. She knows the her basic commands, such as sit, down, stay and off. She's a strong girl, but she walks well on leash with a gentle leader. She also knows when it's bed time and always is the first one in bed. Riley has lived with a 4 year-old lab and did just fine, and she could go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. She's also done well with children of all ages. This quirky and affectionate lady is going to make some family very happy. Come meet her!",

He needs a slower introduction to strangers because he wants to make sure his people are protected. He's been muzzle trained and understands commands like 'sit, 'place, 'lay down, and 'come. He loves his toys, and will steal them from other people and dogs. One of his cutest behaviors is when he takes toys out of his toy box. He also doesn't bark much and when he does, it is typically limited to barking at deer. Justin gets along with some dogs, but needs a well matched pup friend. His best friend is a female German Shepherd who is very chill. He will have a reaction if he is frightened by someone, even if he's been friendly with them before so he needs a patient home who can be understanding with his quirks. What Justin needs next in his development is someone that can put together a routine and stick to it. Come meet this loyal pup, he's waiting for his dedicated forever home.",

He can fetch for hours and is especially delighted to run in and out of pools. It's so much fun to have up to five balls and toys to choose from in his baby pool where he can wallow in the water like a little piggy. Then he'll be happy to walk nicely by your side, hoping for delicious treats. This playful dude wants to be an incredibly loyal companion for his human friends and is happiest to be protective for just one or two. He's a smart boy who wants to keep them safe. He understands 'sit' and 'down' and is working on 'drop' and 'come.' Plus, he's a house- and crate-trained boy who hopes they'll be home with him most of the day. Tuesday hopes for a home with a yard to play in and just wants to be the only pet in one with grownups to play with. Of course, he's going to love one with a baby pool to splash in. Come meet this sweet boy!",

            "description": "Wombat is a skip-the-salad-and-if-you're-going-to-McDonald's-get-me-a-large-fry kinda guy. Meaning he knows what's good and nothing sounds better to him than snacking on the couch or sleeping in your lap! That's not to say he doesn't love his walks, though he prefers to mosey along and sniff the flowers on a loose leash. He's a low energy lover, excited to play with a tennis ball for a few minutes before laying back down at your feet, ready for the shower of belly rubs and snuggles you can't help but give this adorable boy. He enjoys his quiet time and is more than happy to spend his afternoon basking in the sun or napping by your desk chair. And if you catch a glimpse of those soulful eyes staring at you, you'll see all the appreciation and love he has reflecting right back. Wombat has had his history of defensive behavior such as food guarding or getting uncomfortable with strangers who get into his space without warning so he would do best in a low traffic home with adults or a family with older children. He is an extremely intelligent boy who learns quickly and has his own set of tricks such as 'Sit,' 'Down,' 'High Five,' 'Wait,' 'Lay Down,' 'Let's Go,' and most recently learned 'Stay' and 'Come' after only a few tries! He quickly trusts those who take the time to get to know him and will double the amount of affection he's given in return, so long as that affection is given with his consent. And as a bonus, he has gotten along well with dogs he has met and his foster's two resident cats! His chill attitude and calm demeanor make him a perfect match for any low-key home with other chilled out pets. For an individual or family looking to adopt a sweet, smart, and peaceful pup, look no further! If you're not convinced by that cute face, let him sway you with all the love he has to give!",

Well, we think we're not only gorgeous but also loads of fun or is that called double trouble? Haha! We are both sweet and need an amazing home and we love each other so we go together as a pair! What's better than 1 husky, obviously 2 Huskies! Yes, we love walks, hikes, playing with our humans and snuggling up for love! We are neutered, vaccinated and chipped and ready to be pampered!!

He loves to run and fetch, playing well along with his canine buddies. He is currently in foster care and has done well with dogs big and small, and cats too. Aries has herding breed behaviors including being nippy, and he will guard his bed from his foster siblings. His current foster has a large outdoor space, but Aries does not roam, he prefers to stay close, and likes to be in the house with his people. He is becoming more affectionate day by day, and is very treat and ball motivated. He will need a home with folks with breed experience.",

Tonto remained in our care until he was strong enough for orthopedic surgery to repair his leg. His Tibia has a slight curve but gives him no difficulty to move around effortlessly. Tonto is playful, smart and ready to find his forever family. He's truly deserving of love and a forever home where he can find the attention he longs for after such a rough start in this world. Tonto is fully vetted, sterilized and temperament tested. His adoption fee is $425 which includes transpiration off the island. Due to flight limitations, we are looking for a home in the upper east coast for Tonto. Thank you in advance for your support. www.scarpr.org to apply to adopt Tonto.",

            "description": "Nope, it\u2019s not Baby Yoda, but close enough... Prancer is here and ready to break the internet!  \n\nPrancer is another in our quirky chihuahua collection and looking for a specific home... this 2 year old bigger chi (13 lbs) was owned by an elderly woman who never socialized him and as a result is a very nervous guy who takes time to trust.  When his foster mom rescued him he was terrified, untouchable, and severely overweight, but he\u2019s now a healthy weight and has gained a lot of confidence.  Once he loves you, you are his whole world ? and he will be a loyal devoted protector to his chosen person. He fears and hates men and wants to be the only guy in your life, and is looking for a home with preferably just one woman.   It probably won\u2019t be love at first sight at least on his part, and he need some patience to earn his trust in order to see his sweet side underneath the \u201ctough guy\u201d attitude he invokes when scared.   It\u2019s hard to tell from the photos but he has a gorgeous unique spotted red merle coat... and of course those giant expressive eyes ?, and so much personality.  \n\nPrancer is currently in foster with other animals but gets jealous sharing attention and would be best as your one and only ? Valentine ?   If you are happily single and looking for a devoted dedicated best friend and sidekick, please email njwoof@cs.com for an appointment to meet Prancer!\n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

Currently with a larger female who is a strong gal and there are no conflicts with her, but when I added a submissive female her size (actually her sister so it could have been sibling rivalry stuff that went on) BACON bullied her.  \n\nBecause she did that and is a strong girl, we will not put her in a home with small kids, but kids over age 10 would and should be a very good fit.  \n\nShe can be pretty playful, another reason for older kids. \n\nBEAUTIFUL gal who wants an active family.  She is curious, playful with the dogs, always excited to see me. Has not been a jumper, and so too I think she would be pretty smart and easier to train. She likes treats. \n\nCall Marilyn at 573-722-3035 to adopt from 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time. \n\nDO CALL or DO DO DO leave a phone number if you send an email message. \n\nAdoption fee is $250.",

He came to us with a dislocated femur.  Louie needed surgery which was done in early January.  He is on cage rest and limited  movement for 9 weeks which is the estimated healing time. The vet estimates after 4 months he will be ready for water therapy to bring full healing to his leg.  We are guessing he will need 6 months of care and sponsorship before we can place him for adoption.  If you would like to help with his care, we would be grateful.  You can donated to him via:  PayPal.Me/RescueTails or via Zelle at RescueTailsAnimalWelfare@gmail.com.  Our website has donation links as well: RescueTailsAnimalWelfare.org  Thank yoU!",

            "description": "Meet POKER FACE, a little girl who speaks her mind and will be a candidate for separation anxiety if babied.  She is looking for a family who can teach her independence.  Prefer a home with another dog or cats to keep her company.  \n\nOH SO CUTE!   This gal has a square frame, legs are normal length, not short. Fur is so soft and airy.  Muzzle is slightly underbite, little bit of a smashed nose. Big round eyes, and may I say in again, she is sooooooooooo cute ... \n\nShould mature in the 35 to 45 pound range.  \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother. There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue. Sizes from less than 20 pounds to 46 pounds.\n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

LOVER GIRL!  \n\nWe call her QUEEN OF HEARTS for obvious reasons...\n\nCuddles, playful, not needy, submissive and SO cute!  Everyone wants this gal... She is among the smallest in the litter at 7 pounds at 9.5 weeks.  Should mature at around 25 to 30 pounds. \n\nSoft fine long fur... memorable color and pattern, soft temperament that wants to be held and loved.... Slight puggy face, slight underbite. \n\nNeed I say more?\n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother. There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue. Sizes from less than 20 pounds to 46 pounds.\n\n$350 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

Often sits to be petted.\n\nOH SO SHORT legs and for me a winner! She has the black look but an undercoat of a dark khaki or some odd toffee color.\n\nWe call her QUEEN OF DIAMONDS due to that little white streak on her center forehead.\n\nCuddles, playful, not needy, submissive and SO cute! \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother. There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue. Sizes from less than 20 pounds to 46 pounds.\n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

A very sweet doggie who is still adjusting to life at the rescue, Juniper is very loving to her people and enjoys winning their petting. A medium-sized young lady, Juniper does well on her leash after starting out a bit shy. Once outside she enjoys just chilling with her people & taking life in. In playgroups, she meets other dogs well but runs away from those who are too pushy or energetic. For now she gravitates toward other dogs who have her same calm personality. We just know Juniper will blossom in a loving home.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Thick shorter legs... When you look at this litter he stands out.\n\nReally good temperament. A little independent and curious. Playful too. \n\nWeighed 9 lbs and 4 ounces at 9.5 wks of age.  Should mature around 35 to 40 pounds.  \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother. There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue. Sizes from less than 20 pounds to 46 pounds.\n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

He likes to lavish kisses on his people and makes sure to lean into them to grab some good petting. Fun-loving and ready for anything, Zeus comes out with enthusiasm and and wants to run, but he\u2019s attentive and listens well to to help him stay on track. In playgroups, he searches out the other active dogs because he knows they can have great fun together - he's too much for calmer dogs but would absolutely love having a pup playmate.  Zeus is looking for an active home with folks who will appreciate the playful, bouncy energy that he will bring into their lives! NO cats!\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

I am having a hard time figuring his adult weight.  Possibly over 45 pounds, but when no longer free fed, his fast growth may slow down.  \n\nShort thick legs, Very thick frame, medium long ears and a face as square as a block!\n\nHe is somewhat independent. A content guy. As long as there is food near he is HAPPY!\n\nHe was so determined to get down from the table while taking photos. Once he made up his mind it was hard to convince him of anything else.  So I would say he is a bit stubborn. \n\nHe is GREAT in the pack,\n\nLooking for a family with older kids. His independent behavior and determined pattern would be better in a home with consistency, there being OLDER kids who can be consistent in training too.\n\nVERY short stocky legs, this thick boy is a HOOT! \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother. There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue. Sizes from less than 20 pounds to 46 pounds.\n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

She is estimated to be 1 year old and currently weighs 40 pounds. She is dog and cat friendly! We will post more info as we get to know her.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\nBlackJack\n\nis doing great! She's been one of the easiest snuggliest dogs we've had at our house (out of fosters, dog-sitting, or our own). She's a quick study, calm, and gentle when playing or taking treats. We have left her a couple times in the crate during the day when we went out and she did fine, but in general, she has been stuck to my side like glue. She's adjusted to our wake schedule within the week and hasn't chewed on anything she's not supposed to. (She has carried my shoe to me once, to let me know she needed to go out - but no damage to the shoe!). She's had no accidents since the first day and has found her spot to go in the yard with regularity & quickness. She'll need some help with leash training but she is eager to please and pays good attention to me when we are out on a walk, so I think it will come easily with practice. I have seen 2 instances where she's a bit wary of tall men, so she will need more training and confidence building to overcome that fear.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in Texas and is joining us via our TX rescue partner to find a forever home. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated in a foster home.\n\nAbout Foster to Adopt Program:\nFosters provide a safe landing spot for dogs transitioning from the shelter environment and help prepare the dogs for adoption. You provide the love and structure, and we take care of everything else! We cover all vet care, and drive the adoption process. Average length of foster is 2-3 weeks. Fosters do get first consideration for adoption, if desired.\n\nApply to foster online at www.doggoneseattle.org/foster-application",

She loves to run through the backyard and chase squirrels, play with other dogs, roll in the grass (hopefully she likes snow too), and sunbathe.  When indoors, Wrigley wrestle with her canine bestie, crawls across the carpet to scratch her belly and snuggles into her cozy dog bed.  She does well in a crate.  Wrigley has graduated training classes for basic commands (she could use reminders) and is very motivated by treats. She is a gentle giant \u2013 she doesn\u2019t bark, has never been heard to growl, yet she will give you a gentle poke with her nose to request attention.  Wrigley likes to rest her head on your lap I hopes of getting pet.  She has never been invited on the furniture so doesn\u2019t expect to be up there.  She rides great in the car and loves to go on trips.  Wrigley is also a great running partner.\n\nHer family would love for her to find a forever family that can give her the love and attention she deserves.  They recommend a family with at least one other playful dog, a large yard, and older children although she is amazing with children, her larger size and happy tail can cause the little kids to get bumped over. \nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact us at DOGS@SAVINGPAWS.COM to set up an appointment.  All of our dogs are in foster homes so you will need to schedule an appointment to come meet the dog/puppy. We require approved applications to adopt an animal through Saving Paws Animal Rescue, Inc., so please serious inquiries only. We are a volunteer run animal rescue so please allow us time to get back to you for an appointment. Our applications can be found on our website at www.savingpaws.com \n\nAdoption fees include; Spay/Neuter, Micro-chipped, age appropriate vaccines including distemper, bordatella and if old enough rabies vaccines, dewormed, heartworm tested(if old enough)\n\nWe are always in need of foster homes, so if you are interested in opening your home and heart to an animal in need until they find their furever homes, please  email dogs@savingpaws.com.\nSaving Paws Animal Rescue Inc. is a no-kill animal welfare nonprofit organization dedicated to saving homeless, abandoned and special needs pets.

He should mature about 28-30 pounds at maturity. \n\nVERY short legs, this little man is a HOOT!\n\nNot a bossy or mean alpha. He mellowed out a lot at age 8 weeks. I guess the litter is so laid back there was no more competition so he felt he could let his fur down and just blend back in. \n\nLikes being held but is not mushy.  Somewhat independent. \n\nRed merle, this little guy is a conversation maker with his interesting build and hooty personality.\n\nA mild alpha puppy, he will be a fun and playful dog.  VERY good in his pack and doe not need to play act being an alpha.  \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother. There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue. Sizes from less than 20 pounds to 46 pounds.\n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

            "description": "Brax is aprx 1.5 year old male American Staffy who hasn't had the best start. \nUnfortunately, Brax was a victim of some form of abuse that damaged his vocal cords and he has some scar tissue build up on his neck. Have no fear though, it does not prevent him from \"Wooing\" his happy \"woos\" or singing you songs in a chihuahua-like pitch. He also likes to \"tip tap\" when he's excited. And he does get excited - particularly when you call him a handsome good boy! \nDespite being treated poorly by his former \"humans\" Brax loves all of the things. Cats, other dogs, humans young and old. He is very gentle when he is being a good boy! He enjoys walking on his leash, playing with other dogs, or running around in the yard.\n+Brax resource guards his food, snackies, and water. However, there is a solution to this issue & it's an easy one! If you have another dog separate meal areas are needed and treats should not be handed out together. He is a patient boy and will wait his turn for his treats! \n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "OH SO CUTE meet BLACK JACK, weighed 9 lbs and 14 ounces at age 9.5 weeks.  Should mature in the 30 to 40 pound range. \n\nHe is somewhat independent, but does like to cuddle.\n\nHe is a curious dude, likes to explore. I thought he was going to be the alpha but he is not! Just an ordinary guy in the litter who loves all his siblings equally.\n\nYou can see the merle in his chest and feet. Diamond on his nose. \n\nA middle of the road puppy, he will be a fun and playful dog. \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother.  There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue.  Sizes from less than 20 pounds  to 46 pounds. \n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

She's good with cats too.  She has a light undercoat that shines beautifully under her thick black coat :-) Super affectionate, very playful.\n\nHer adoption fee includes her spaying, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, microchip. She was born on a reservation we work with Sept 16, 2020.\n\nDo you live in our adopting area? Do you have another young playful friendly male dog of similar adult breed size?  If yes to both questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Puppies MUST adopt to families that have another young friendly playful dog of similar breed size when grown. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets.

Seems like she would be a very brave pup but as curious as she is and determined as she can be at times, she was worried up on the crate for the photos session.\n\nShe was the first to climb out of the clothes basket as a tiny baby. She use to cry to scold me when I ignored her, but does not do that anymore. She does love to be held, but done when she is done.. She plays very well in the litter and is one of the first pups to come to me when I enter their kennel.  \n\nA middle of the road puppy, she will be a fun and playful dog. \n\nThe mother to this litter is a Lab and Heeler looking dog who weighs 46 pounds. Fathers were probably the Brindle 30 male and a 35 pound Airedale looking male, who was surely from the Shih Tzu looking mother.  There were 14 dogs on this property we helped rescue.  Sizes from less than 20 pounds  to 46 pounds. \n\n$250 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE",

Australian Shepherds Furever found us and sent us to our best friend and foster mom Megan Pyatt! Because we were so starved she had to feed us very small meals till we could eat like normal dogs. We are now ready to get the last steps of our vetting done to find our furever family.\n\nWe really need to stay together. We are about 8 months old and we have been though so much and are very bonded. We are both very loving and outgoing but will need some training and potty work. Our foster mom has worked hard with us. She says we are good babies.  We just got spayed/neutered and we will be ready shortly to go to our furever homes!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting us please fill out the application and see if we are a good fit for you. Thank you!\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nOur mix puppies are $395 each, but we are offering a $100 discount for this bonded pair to keep them together.\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

YOU will love this puppy! Muted Brindle, long soft coat. A more square frame, very \"middle of the road\" temperament. Likes to cuddle, can be more independent. 9 lbs 2 ounces at 9.5 weeks I expect him to weigh around 35 to 40 pounds at maturity. \n\n$300 to adopt. We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\n\nOtherwise if you use your vet we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age.\n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21. They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi.\n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt . IF you send a reply here INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I call people before I email them back.\n\nPHONE NUMBER PLEASE\n\nThis litter of pups are all named after things related to cards or card games.",

Give me alllllll the animal friends - I love all of them...cats, dogs, chickens...etc!\n? I would even love some kids of my very own - but a little older would make me happiest since they know how treat dogs nicely \n? An owner that will shower me with love and attention and tell me how handsome I am every single day\n\nSpot is both house and crate trained - He is just an amazingly sweet young kiddo looking for his forever home...is it you?! \n\nSpot\u2019s adoption fee is $175.  He has been neutered, is microchipped, tested heartworm negative, and is up date on vaccines.  To schedule an appointment to meet Spot, fill out an application for adoption (this doesn\u2019t tie you to adopt, just gives us a way to chat with you further) at www.safehavenanimalrescue.org and his foster mom will reach out to discuss him further ??",

She loves kids and cats, but would be better in a single dog home. She is very timid and cautious of strangers but eventually warms up. She loves to play tug of war and eats ice cubes like treats! She prefers a couch or bed over the floor and loves to be wherever the people are. She is great in the car and on a leash, though she tends to get excited about squirrels and needs reminding to stay close. She chases lasers and light reflections just like a cat and will do it for hours if you let her! What a Doll!!! (posted 1/28/21, CP)\n**It is rare that we know with certainty the ages or mixes that make up our dogs, but we do our best to be as accurate as possible based upon our experience. **\nAdoption: $350 which covers quarantine, shots, worming, food, medical records, spaying/neutering,microchip and an Alabama State Health Certificate.\nTransport, if needed : $140.00 We consider the transport to be of great importance and, as such, take particular care of the dogs during the trip from Alabama.

He's a smart cookie and will learn fast, so training him is vital.  ADOPT HIM!\n\nApply on our website if interested: shelterfriends.org\n\n**PLEASE DO NOT MESSAGE OR EMAIL US QUESTIONS.

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nRusso is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~2 years \nWeight: ~55lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Hasn't been left alone much due to COVID and will need an adopter that can continue to work on this. He does take time to settle when left alone.\nDog sociability: He's selective about his dog friends. On walks, he is often reactive towards dogs his size or larger. Would benefit from continued leash training and an adopter that can continue to work on socialization. \nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Russo is looking for a home in a quieter neighborhood where he can practice his leash skills! He is also working on being left solo, so thin walls won't work for this guy. \n\nRusso is the snuggliest dog and a total sweetheart! He always wants to be with his person and is a great work from home companion. He would love to sit in your lap and go for long adventures in the car. Russo enjoys walks and playing outside in the snow but is a huge fan of naps, too! Russo has been great with new people and wants to share his love with everyone. He is a true foodie and mealtime is the absolute best time of day for Russo! \n\nRusso's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours.

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nSantos is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~5 years \nWeight: ~83lbs (overweight and needs to lose some)\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be on a strict schedule. \nCrate trained: Doing well with his crate training and sees the crate as his safe spot in the home.\nDog sociability: Friendly! Santos needs to be adopted into a home with a resident dog as he is his most confident self when he is with a dog companion.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but shy/timid so older kids only\nIdeal home: Santos is a sweet, sensitive dog looking for a patient home that can allow him time to come out of his shell. He is timid of loud noises and will do best in a quieter neighborhood. He requires a resident dog in his forever home.\n\nSantos will take one look at you and you'll instantly be smitten with his David Bowie eyes! Santos gets an A+ in social distancing, both from strangers and sometimes within the home (he cares about everyone's health!). He'll let you into his inner circle once he's thoroughly assessed you and decided you're safe to hang with. With his pup pals, his interview process is less thorough and he's been known to make friends immediately. Taking naps in a blanket fort or under your desk for hours is a favorite hobby as is showing off his moves once he figures out how to jump onto the couch for more napping activities. Santos is an excellent work from home buddy. He'll make sure you stay on task but won't let you forget to take a walk or pause for a snack (creamy peanut butter, preferred). Santos truly lives up to his name and he is most certainly, a saint. \n\nSantos' adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Santos has moderate dental calculus and fractured incisors. He will benefit from at-hme dental care and a dental cleaning with potential extractions. He is overweight and would benefit from gradual weight loss.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications.

            "description": "GIZZY is affectionate and playful. She is smart and will do well in doggie daycare and training classes once she's old enough. She loves to cuddle with humans and play with dogs. She's good with cats too. \n\nHer adoption fee includes her spaying, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, and microchip. She was born on a reservation we work with November 19, 2020.  \n\n** Do you live in our adopting area? ** Do you have another young playful friendly male dog of similar adult breed size? ** IF YES to these questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nWe have specific ADOPTION and COVID rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Puppies MUST adopt to families that have another young friendly playful dog of similar breed size when grown. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be able to reply to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n",

We pay for the spay or neuter, and one more puppy shot as well as rabies shot if puppy vetting done with one of our partner vets in our area who are:\n\n. Animal Health Center of Dexter MO\n. Bollinger County Veterinary Service in Marble Hill MO.\n. Helping Hands Veterinary Clinic in Advance MO\n. Lacroix Pet Hospital in Cape Girardeau MO\n. Tilsit Road Animal Clinic in rural Jackson MO\nOtherwise we give a $50 refund with proof of spay or neuter when of age. \n\nFirst shot and microchip applied for all pups was at 7.5 weeks of age. They were isolated and protected, regularly dewormed, and regularly given Marquis to control tummy issues in such a large pack. Second shot weekend of 1/29/21.  They leave us with a puppy kit: De-wormer, Marquis, and one application of Advantage Multi. \n\nHouse and hand raised.\n\nCall 573-722-3035 between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time to adopt .

My former family had me since I was a puppy, so as you might guess, my world has been turned upside down. Upon arriving in CO, the volunteers immediately noticed that I had to say hi to every single person I met. I'm now settling into a foster home that I share with two adults and two other dogs and I'm doing great! Many people may pass me by due to my age, but I hope there's a special someone/family out there who would open their home and heart(s) to a sweet girl like me. I'm housetrained, crate trained and I know some basic commands. I do need to lose a few pounds, but I'd be really happy to join you on a daily walk if you would like a buddy! If you are interested, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application. My adoption fee is $200.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

            "description": "Dolly is a sweet little pup of about 10 weeks old.  She is a mixed breed pup that will likely be   40-60 as an adult.  She loves people and kisses. Dolly is ready for her forever! She is good with dogs and humans alike!\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425 with $100 refundable deposit added.  This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

My favorite place to lay in this cold weather is on top of the heat vent.  Or early morning snuggles on moms lap.  My favorite toys are my chew bones, any ball, toys that squeaks and stuffed animals. Wait ... I like all toys! I also like to snuggle down in my dog bed with a soft blanket.  Potty training is pretty new for me but I will catch on fast. I have mastered sit and lay down . I like to be helpful and get inside the dishwasher every time my foster mom opens it.  I don\u2019t get why she keeps putting me back on the floor.  I\u2019m going to need a forever home that is experienced with my breed and prepared to work with a trainer to be sure I become the best me I can.  I can be pretty stubborn sometimes & need a family to help me work on that.  A home where I\u2019m not left alone much would really be great and a fenced yard too. I\u2019m super cute as you can see & growing real fast . I\u2019m told I\u2019m going to be a big boy some day.  I do have an eye issue and the vet said it should be removed.  It will be done along with my neuter and while this is not ideal I was born this way and it is all I know!\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425 with $100 refundable deposit added.  This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

He was kept outside most of life, which explains his unusual coloring for a Husky.  The exposure to direct sunlight made Bandit lose all the pigment in his beautiful coat. \n\nBandit, above all, needs TLC.  He needs a life filled with good food, lots of time indoors feeling safe.  He LOVES attention and he LOVES to play! \n\nHe has a prolapsed anus, which we are trying to get fixed.  \n\nBandit would do well in a home paired with a female dog, but he is good with all including cats and kids. \n\nExperienced Husky owners as preferred.  \n\nBandit didn't deserve the hand he was dealt, but we know that with the help of Mayte's Rescue and with the love and care of someone who is willing to open up their heart and home - the rest of Bandit's life can be great.  \n\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Sundae! He has been raised in foster care and is very well socialized with kids and dogs. He plays hard and loves hard. He is estimated to be a large dog when full grown (somewhere between 60-80 lbs) and will do best in a home that has a yard, experience with large/powerful breeds, and willingness to work on training and exposures throughout puppyhood and his transition into adult life. Sundae would love a home that will continue to foster his adventurous, curious, playful side.\n\nHis $400 adoption fee covers his vaccinations, deworming, microchip, neuter, collar, and leash. $100 will be refunded upon completion of any puppy training program.
