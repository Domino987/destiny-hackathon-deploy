He plays great with female dogs and prefers them over males, but will sit for treats and takes them so gently! He is good with kids and a bit of a wiggle butt (as you can see from the blurred tail wag.) He also lived with a kitty in his past home. He would love a new home to call his own! \n\nFREE PULL FOR LICENSED RESCUES!\n\nFor adoption application please fill this out, and  someone will contact you. \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/202108953737155",

He LOVES to play ball and playing with his toys.  He also loves being in your lap and in the big bed, if he is allowed.  He is kennel trained, but will give you those sad eyes if he has to go in.  He is also doggie door trained and will sit to receive his food.  Overall, he is really a good, friendly dog.  His only issue is if he meets new people and they reach to pet him, he might nip them.  He needs to meet people slowly.  At his foster home after the 2nd day there, he realized he could trust them and was very friendly.  He would not do well with children and needs an experienced Schnauzer owner.\nContact Miniature Schnauzer Rescue of Houston at msrh.org and complete the Adoption Application.\nAdoption Fee:  $350",

He does well on a leash and knows to sit on command.  He loves playing in the water and with a tennis ball.  He seems to get along with other dogs and loves to play.  He is a very active dog and needs plenty of space to run.  Walker is heartworm negative, has current vaccinations, and is neutered. His adoption fee is $195, which for an approved adopter $120 is sponsored. An additional $20 is for an Avid microchip and registration.",

            "description": "Our big, happy boy Garth is searching for his furever family! If you are looking for a big, loving, happy-go-lucky furball to be your companion, Garth may be the pyrfect boy for you. Garth came to us as a stray with unknown history, but he has quickly won over the hearts of our volunteers with his happy, wiggly butt and a tail that never stops wagging. This boy simply thrives with the love and attention of people - as long as he can be in the proximity of his people, he is as happy as can be. Still very much an oversized puppy, Garth loves playing with his toys and/or foster siblings for short bursts, then he promptly finds a cozy place to plop down for a nice long nap to recharge. How cute is that? These days, Garth is working on getting used to being around new people (he was a stray, after all) and learning that a leash can lead to many good things. This big boy still has a lot to learn in life, but he has such a happy, positive, eager-to-please attitude that training is not a chore to him. In fact, he will most definitely benefit with consistent, positive reinforcement training. If you are willing to open your heart and your home to this wonderfully sweet boy, he will no doubt be on his best behavior and mature into your most loyal companion for life!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I am sweet guy and known to be talkative with loads of personality. I am good with other dogs and love my humans too. I'm a little mouthy and can play a little rough, so best if I go to a home without small children. I would love to go to obedience training with you so I can learn how to be the best canine citizen. Unfortunately my previous owner did not have me on monthly heart worm preventative and now I have tested positive for heart worms. Heart worms can be deadly to us pups if left untreated so of course the nice people at BDRR will treat me with a special heart worm treatment plan to make me healthy again. The adoption team can explain the whole treatment process and also talk to you about the importance of keeping me on heart worm preventative going forward.",

She really would like a home - I believe - where she has a person who is home most of the time.  And a fenced yard.  And walks at a quiet time - at least for awhile.  Ginger is a sweetheart and deserves another chance - this time hopefully in a forever home.  If you are interested please go to our website \"odas.org\" and under the Adoption tab, fill out the preliminary and return it.  We will schedule an appointment for a visit.",

He's smart and loves treats. He likes the car and loves running around outside. He will benefit with more leash training, but other than that he is PERFECT!

            "description": "Gibson aka Grover von Gefell is a wonderful 3-4 year old Shepherd mix. This handsome, bicolor boy can be so sweet with the people he knows at the rescue but is on the shy side (including a bit hand shy) with strangers. That is why he is seeking an adults-only calmer home. Gibson is a medium energy dog and is a very curious boy. On his walks, he keeps an eye out ahead and will lead if you let him. If you too like a quick pace to your adventures out, he is happy to join you on a good jog. Gibson is a smart boy; he knows several commands and is eager to learn more. He has experience being in a home, is housebroken, and has shown good indoor and outside manners. Gibson does well around other dogs, whether on leash or off. As is his demeanor, he says hello but then settles back and does his own thing. (No cats please.) Gibson is seeking a kind home with people that will give him time, and who will appreciate his sensitivity and loyalty.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nNala was apart of a creuilty case in North Louisiana. They were holding her at the shelter since she was 3 months old while the case was ongoing in court. \n Nala is approximately 10 months old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nSince Nala has spent almost her entire life living at a shelter she is very puppy like. She knows nothing but a cement kennel with limited human interaction. Through no fault of her own, this 10 month old girl has the mind set of a 3 month old puppy, wanting to play and eager to learn new things. She is an amazing girl with so much love to give. \n\nNala is house trained, kennel trained & knows his basic commands/manners.\n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Nala, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

            "description": "Butterscotch is a a 3-year old, 47lb, energetic pittie mix looking for her fur-ever home! She was rescued from Mexico and since being in the states, has been vaccinated, microchipped, and enrolled in training classes. Butterscotch aims to please and just wants to be close to you. She enjoys her time in the backyard and likes to go on walks, but she is also just as happy laying in her bed next to you or splooting on the floor. Butterscotch did not have an easy life before coming to us so she needs a family that is willing to be patient with her. She currently lives with our 6 resident dogs and has done amazingly well with all of them. She did have a squabble with one of her rescue mates, so while she is dog friendly to our dogs, she doesnt get along with one dog in our home.... With that said, she would need to meet any future fur sibling to see if it would work out or not. Butterscotch is not a fan of cats and has not lived with children but given her size, and energy level, I think she would do best with older children. Butterscotch has made so much progress in the past few weeks and now will be the perfect addition to someone's home!\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required.

This handsome and sweet boy has good leash manners and enjoys walking right next to you. A mid-energy boy, he is looking for his special someone, we think he'll do better in a home than a kennel setting.  Around the kennel Levi sometimes voocalizes around other dogs on leash. He just loves toys, so a great solution has been for him to carry a favored toy from the toy box to hold on his walk.  He is much more relaxed off-leash and meets all of his playgroup pals very nicely, both male and female. This friendly boy likes to explore the yard and then comes back to his people for some petting. Cats, however, are not within his inner circle. Levi is ready to meet you.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

Tori is the most fabulous girl. Brindle with the classic face. She is as sweet as she can be. Tori loves to play but would like nothing better than to snuggle on the couch. She insists on hugs, not kisses and will sneak a drink of unprotected coffee if you aren't watching!\nT ori is great with all her foster siblings from the smallest to the biggest. She follows behind her brothers and plays chase in the yard, or hide and seek in the house. She is going to make an awesome addition to any family. Tori is cautious and shy. She will need patience and love in her new home but once she has gained confidence she will be totally dedicated. She would love to have a little boy to love! Please contact info@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online at www.aarfhouston.org/forms . Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He is a special needs boy. He has anxiety about meeting strangers. His perfect home would be, a quiet mature home, with a secure fenced yard, not a lot of socializing with company, a smaller buddy preferably female, and a new momma. Men scare him. His reaction to strangers is to bark. And keep barking til the scarey things go away. The best part of Bruno is that once he is settled in he is a total lovebug. He doesn't just snuggle with you, he is velcro. He looks at you with loving eyes and just wants to be by you. He's extremely strong and quick. He likes to bolt out the door instead of just walking out. He's a unique little guy and is looking for a new mama that will accept him just the way he is.\n\nIf you're interested in Bruno please contact Alternative Humane Society.\n\nHe's happy and loves to play outside. He is a Barker! No apartments or condos sorry.\n\nIf you're interested in Bruno and would like to meet him contact Alternative Humane Society by filling out a statement of interest.\n\nalternativehumanesociety.com",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nOpal is a very sweet 2.5 year old girl who would like nothing more than be by your side. She is good with people of all genders and size. During the COVID-19 outbreak, Opal has kept her foster mom company while she works from home, and is very loving and eager to please. One of her favorite activities is going on car rides. Opal lost her first home due to a reported attack on a small dog that entered her yard. Because of this, Opal needs a home with no other dogs or cats. Opal is looking for a new mom or dad that can continue to help her make progress on her dog-reactivity and health issues. Opal suffers from Ovarian Remnant Syndrome and, although she has been spayed, she goes into heat twice a year. When Opal goes into her next heat cycle, Shenandoah Shepherd Rescue will coordinate and pay for Opal's exploratory surgery to attempt to find the remaining tissue and correct the problem; however, sometimes surgery is not always successful.\n\nGood with Adults, Good with Kids, Does Good in the Car, Not Good with Dogs, Not Good with Cats, Somewhat vocal, Housebroken, Cratetrained, Leashtrained, Affectionate\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

            "description": "Bowie is a 2 year old neutered male flat coat retriever with potential border collie in the mix.  He has white markings such as the razor thin blaze down his nose and along his throat; white tips on his two hind paws and a touch of white on two of his front paw toes.  His  expressive amber eyes add to his intelligent character.\n\nThe absolute best household dynamic for Bowie is a quiet, easy going ADULT household with few surprises day to day.  The adults should be experienced large dog owners that are easy going, relaxed, consistent  and know how to set clear, fair boundaries and follow a formula for continued success.  Tight living situations in close community type neighborhoods and reliance on street walking are NOT for this dog.  He'd be at his personal best in a more spacious rural scenario where he can just be a relaxed companion to those he loves and where there are limited influences to challenge his behavior.\n\nAt just 6 weeks of life Bowie was taken from his mom and shipped to NJ and irresponsibly placed by his rescue organization.  He lived with five children under the age of eight.  Socialization of the dog was not a priority and now 2 years later he's way behind in  learning the way we all learn - by cataloging new experiences and building our self-confidence and awareness of a bigger world. \n\nBowie is a sensitive soul - much like a nature lover or artist that prefers quiet times in open spaces and interacting with the people he trusts and loves.  \n\n  I asked my husband to describe Bowie and he said he's a fantastic  dog with one quirk and that quirk is random apprehension towards NEW experiences.  The key to success with this dog is taking new experiences (for him) slowly, very slowly.  This is a dog that requires a management protocol - he can't be thrown into situations with a lets see what happens approach.  He needs to bond with his caretakers that believe in him and that will have time/patience to help him build confidence in his surroundings. He's what I call a TRUE RESCUE - a work in progress that will be extremely rewarding to his caretaker over time.\n\nTo discuss Bowie please send an e:mail summarizing your household dynamic.  auntmarysdoghouse@yahoo.com. You can also leave a VM message on 908-362-1333 but e:mail get s a quicker response. Thank you!",

She devotes herself to her owners. Sugar came to as as a puppy that was no longer wanted. She was fostered for about two months by a volunteer for college credit. She was recently adopted back in January 2020 and stayed with them for 5 months. They did a marvelous job and calmed her down quite a bit! She is the type of dog that craves attention even if it's negative. She is quick and smart. High play prey drive. She was returned because COVID -19 restricted their time together and she got aggressive with the cat! Only recommend children over 12 to be in the home. Likes some other dogs but she really needs to be the only pet! Knows commands and loves to walk!",

            "description": "The highlights....3 year old beagle/basset hound mix, 41 pounds, great with dogs, crate trained, housebroken in his foster home.  Super sweet with people.  One of the two founding members of The Beagle Brothers.  (please see Coltrane's listing on our site...just in case you're looking for double trouble!)\n\nREQUIRED: fenced yard; another playful dog in the home (or maybe adopt his brother Coltrane too?); experience with the problem-solving,  creativity and patience  needed with hound-style hounds and their \"we do things our own way\" approach to life; significant distance from your neighbors as a sound buffer; a household free of young and fairly young children (due to how much awareness and organization it takes to keep a nosey and busy hound from getting into vet-requiring trouble with discarded toys and their tiny pieces,  half-finished and left-behind lunches and snacks, etc. )\n\nMore detail...Elvis is one of the two sniff-iest, snort-iest, snuffle-iest hounds we've met yet. (Coltrane is the other!) This guy experiences pure joy while tracking...multiple times per day...for prolonged periods of time.  He frequently sings the Song of His Hound Dog People...loudly...while tracking. (Insert consideration of your proximity to your neighbors here...no apartments, town homes, duplexes, or homes without very large yards).  Elvis loves other dogs, affection from his humans, and squishy dog beds.   He has settled into a routine well after coming from an outdoor life with no rules or training.  That said, he is used to spending a great deal of the day exploring a fenced yard, wrestling with another dog, and checking in with humans for affection. All of this interaction sets him up for good behavior and sets his humans up for less well-meaning trouble to interrupt.   Leash walks will not be sufficient for meeting this guy's needs...and they do not look like the happy picture of strolling around the block that most of us are used to.  That NOSE again.   Like all committed hounds, Elvis must be on-leash or within a fenced yard at all times,  as he has a case of  \"beagle selective hearing\".  This means means when his nose is to the ground and he is on a scent, he turns off his hearing and won't listen to your calls despite whatever danger he may be headed towards.  \n\nHaving said all of this...to people who \"get\" him (his foster family and their dog-loving tribe), Elvis is hysterical, adorable and just so sweet!\n\nElvis has been neutered and microchipped, is heartworm negative, and is up to date on all vaccines and deworming. He is on flea and heartworm prevention, and his adoption fee is $195. \n\nHere at NMAR, we don't just find good homes for our dogs, we find the the specific good home for each specific dog.  Because our goal really is FOREVER homes, our write-ups are \"real life\" to paint true pictures, as some dogs have longer \"must have lists\" than others.  This is all in the spirit of our very best effort to avoid putting a dog or an adopter through returning a pup to us when the match just wasn't right for all involved.    While we work towards those matches, our dogs are safe and happy in foster homes or in our home-like shelter.  While there, they have a chance to learn some life skills and show us what they need to be happy and healthy...and to make their forever family happy and successful too.\n\nIf you've been looking for one (or two) of the world's cutest and silliest dogs, the FIRST STEP is to fill out an adoption application. Meet and greets do not occur without an approved application.  We thank you for your patience as our volunteer-run rescue reviews your information.  https://www.northmeckanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/adoption-application/",

            "description": "The short story:  Coltrane is a 40-ish pound, 3 year old, beagle/basset hound mix, who is great with other dogs, is crate-trained, and is house-broken in his routine at the shelter.  He is good with people, but he has a more reserved, introverted type of personality when he is one-on-one with a human.  Add another friendly dog who seeks out affection, and Coltrane steps up his interest level for sure!\n\nREQUIRED: fenced yard; another playful dog in the home (or maybe adopt his brother Elvis too?); experience with the problem-solving, creativity and patience needed with hound-style hounds and their \"we do things our own way\" approach to life; significant distance from your neighbors as a sound buffer; a household free of young and fairly young children (due to how much awareness and organization it takes to keep a nosey and busy hound from getting into vet-requiring trouble with discarded toys and their tiny pieces,  half-finished and left-behind lunches and snacks, etc. )\n\nA bit more detail...Coltrane loves running his silly, beagley-basset waddle in hopes of catching up to his canine friends for a good wrestle.  He also likes playing with toys, but his TRUE LOVE is \"snuffling\".   Coltrane is one of the two sniff-iest, snort-iest, snuffle-iest hounds we've met yet. (Elvis is the other!) This guy experiences pure joy while tracking...multiple times per day...for prolonged periods of time.  He frequently sings the Song of His Hound Dog People...loudly...while tracking.   (Insert consideration of your proximity to your neighbors here...no apartments, town homes, duplexes, or homes without very large yards).  Coltrane does great with other dogs.  While living at the rescue, he has settled into a routine well.  That said, he is used to spending a great deal of the day exploring the fenced play yards, wrestling with other dogs, playing with toys, and checking in with humans for affection on his terms while he roams the house-like areas of the rescue building.  All of this interaction sets him up for learning expectations and following routines.  Leash walks alone will not be sufficient for meeting this guy's emotional and physical needs. Like all committed hounds, Coltrane must be on-leash or within a fenced yard at all times,  as he has a case of  \"beagle selective hearing\".  This means means when his nose is to the ground and he is on a scent, he turns off his hearing and won't listen to your calls despite whatever danger he may be headed towards.  \n\nHaving said all of this...to people who \"get\" him (the volunteers who work with him at the rescue building), Coltrane is hysterical, adorable and just so sweet!\n\nColtrane has been neutered and microchipped, is heartworm negative, and is up to date on all vaccines and deworming. He is on flea and heartworm prevention, and his adoption fee is $195. \n\nHere at NMAR, we don't just find good homes for our dogs, we find the the specific good home for each specific dog.  Because our goal really is FOREVER homes, our write-ups are \"real life\" to paint true pictures, as some dogs have longer \"must have lists\" than others.  This is all in the spirit of our very best effort to avoid putting a dog or an adopter through returning a pup to us when the match just wasn't right for all involved.    While we work towards those matches, our dogs are safe and happy in foster homes or in our home-like shelter.  While there, they have a chance to learn some life skills and show us what they need to be happy and healthy...and to make their forever family happy and successful too.\n\nIf you've been looking for one (or two) of the world's cutest and silliest dogs, the FIRST STEP is to fill out an adoption application. Meet and greets do not occur without an approved application.  We thank you for your patience as our volunteer-run rescue reviews your information.  https://www.northmeckanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/adoption-application/\n\n\n",

This beautiful girl was listed on Craigslist...litter after litter making her owner money with her pups; only worth $25 to anyone who would pay...ANYONE! Luckily, MADR was able to save Angel and her last puppy. Angel has been in a loving foster home learning how to be the best dog she can be ever since. Angel is a sweetheart who loves people and walking around town. She is a sunbather who likes to chill outside all day and loves to go on long walks and hikes. She wants to be with her people and will happily adjust to your schedule. She is smart girl and is learning basic commands and would do well with a loving family who is patient as she learns to trust new environments. She does have slight anxiety that can lead to some barking, however as she builds trust with people, that dissipates. Angel likes children and does well with dogs after a proper introduction. She seems to be afraid of cats, and stays away from them. Children 7 years old or older.  Her forever home is required to have a physically fenced yard (no invisible fences or tie outs). Angel is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house trained. Angel is a kind and loyal soul who will be a great companion for a single person or a family. \n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Angel's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "Oh, sweet Daytona, where do I begin! This precious girl was super lucky to be rescued at the right time! Sadly, she was owned by a man with 5 other shepherd/golden mixed dogs, and their owner passed away. All 6 of his dogs were well taken care of, healthy, and as sweet as can be! Daytona came in exactly 1 week before giving birth to 9 beautiful puppies. Then her job as a Mama started. For over 8 weeks, she cared for, fed, cleaned, and of course played with her puppies. She did a fantastic job raising all 9 puppies! Then they started to head to their homes. Now that her job as a mama has ended, it's time to worry about herself again! \n\nDaytona has awesome jumping skills and might even make a great agility dog. She can scale gates, no problem! She is housebroken, walks well on a leash, and is about 2 years old. \n\nDaytona LOVES other dogs and would really benefit from having another dog to show her how to enjoy the doggie life! At this point no kids in the home with her. \n\nIf interested in Daytona feel free to email her foster samsfosters@yahoo.com or fill out an application.\n\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the Greater Chicago Land area.\n7) A copy of your lease (pet page) is required, and submitted with your application\n\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

I am a very loving dog. I don't like to socialize with other dogs much and I think I would be happiest in an adult-only home where I can be the king of the castle! I do have loads of fun energy, so I will make a great walking or running partner. I am house trained and very good in the home when you go out and about. I simply climb on the couch or into my dog bed and settle in for a little snooze. I am not a fan of cats or bunnies, so best not to have them in the home. I am looking forward to meeting and going home with my forever loving family.",

He was def ready to go outside. And I knew why once we hit the grass. He pottied right away. House trained and friendly, Rocky needs a new home. He had been with his previous family 2 years. That's a long time for a dog, a third of his life! Unfortunately however, after cuddling numerous times with his young human sibling, he snapped at her. We were told although the cuddling had been occurring and everyone was fine prior to this, on this occasion Rocky was sleeping when the little girl tried to cuddle next to him. Without getting into the why's or how's it's a simple fix. Rocky needs a new home where there are no young or small children to interrupt sleep. Supervision is a biggie when bringing a new dog into a home. Whether there are resident dogs or kids, everyone must be watched and respect everyone else. Rocky is a thick boy. He loves those treats! And he'll sit or share your hand or lie down for treats. He'll also bark if you take too much time to give him his reward. He also shrieks. You read that correctly. He shrieks at certain times. It's a bit unsettling and we're not exactly sure why he does this but it's loud. Just something for you to know. He is also easily startled. He'll back away and drop to the ground, again we're not sure why except maybe nerves. Rocky is a sweet boy looking for a new family to take him on daily walks and love him. He's easy on the eyes and also fairly easy going. Rocky is waiting at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and the Center. He's available for appointments so just call 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page and make an appointment. Bring any resident dog and/or kids in to meet him. We're open daily except for Tuesday's. 341 S Birdneck Road. Thanks for choosing adoption!",

NO SMALL CHILDREN - 10 OLD AND OLDERGracie is my name!\n\nI am a little girl who was found with my litter mates in a box next to a dumpster. Who would do that to us? We were saved, and given all the love and care a little girl could ever need. And now, I am getting ready to find my forever home! I am a sweet girl, who loves to cuddle and play. I love running in the yard with the other fur kids. Mom has lots of trees and obstacles in the yard and we play tag all day long. In the house, we have a cat tunnel that we play with. It is so funny to run through and make all that crackling noise. I wait until one of my siblings is in the tunnel and then I pounce on them. They squeal - then we run and find a ball or a rope to play tug with. My favorite thing is to be on high places. I will climb on the back of one of my foster siblings so I can reach what I want to see. They don't seem to mind. My perfect family will be one where my brother Gryffin and I will be together to live out our lives. We play and sleep and need each other - even if somethings we fight, we love each other completely.\nI am going to be a very small dog, so mom says NO Small Children in my future. Tiny bones break too easily.\nI AM EXTREMELY BONDED WITH MY BROTHER, GRYFFIN, SO WE NEED A FOREVER HOME TOGETHER! If you are interested in meeting me, please apply! I am only doing private meetings.\n=========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He is one of the five husky mixes we saved from a life chained outside without shelter, no reprieve from the elements, and seemingly zero human interaction prior to being rescued. He is 10-11 years old and about 65 pounds. He is the absolute sweetest guy in the world. He would do best with another dog in the home who is confident and will help make him feel comfortable. He is still scared of people in general but even more so men, he has gotten a lot better but still very nervous. He does not do well around hyper children, or dogs, cats are also a big no. He also gets very upset when 'his person' leaves the home and will pace the house until they come home, so his forever home must have someone with a lot of patience that spends most of their day at home. He's never been left for more than 6 hours by himself. He likes his schedule and for his life to be predicable. If you are home with him he will request his bed be in whatever room you're in and he will sleep all day. He gives air kisses and loves butt scratches. He is a major shedder as a husky mix so requires daily brushing. Jaeger is a calm old man who just wants to spend the last years of his life feeling the way he has with is foster: safe, loved, accepted.\nApplications for Jaeger @ maxxandme.org\nJaeger is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is only $200.\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received.

She tested heartworm negative and is receiving monthly heartworm prevention. She is ready for adoption. \n\nAngel needs a home willing to let her be her. Angel learns a doggie door and her routine but she is not a dog that likes to be handled much. Angel has done well in a one-person foster home with two other dogs who mostly leave her alone. She does not warm up or want to snuggle or play with another dog. Strangely Angel seems more comfortable with a person who smokes...whether it\u2019s the smell or the voice we aren\u2019t sure. With a little effort to gain her trust, foster mom can pick Angel up to sit with her in her chair, and at times Angel will come ask for petting. She will not compete with other dogs for attention. Angel would do best with a doggie door. Once she learns the routine and picks her sleeping spot, Angel is no trouble. She just doesn\u2019t seem to be that dog a little socializing can \u201cfix\u201d so we are seeking an easy going home that will let her find her own happiness rhythm. \n\nAdoption fee is $150. Must apply: Application for adoption is located at http://fs19.formsite.com/JeffTarpleyRescue/application/index.html\n\nJeff Tarpley Rescue, Inc.\n903-490-2959\n\nFind us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/jefftarpleyrescue/",

My mom says I am the smartest dog she has ever fostered. I listen, and learn really really fast. Smart, Cute, Sweet - what more could you want. I am the perfect boy who lives to please! Plus a cuddle bug.\nI love to play in water. The water hose is my favorite toy! I know sit, crate, and 'Sit Pretty' and sometimes will give Paw. I love to tease the other dogs and often instigate play. My perfect family is one with older children (I am mouthy. I don't bite, but I will open my mouth to play). I would make an exceptional agility dog. I love to run, and would make a great running partner. For me to be really happy, I will need another dog my size to play with. I am good with all sizes, but because of my energy, a dog my size would be a best fist. My foster mom loves me but thinks I would be happier with a family of my own.\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application . Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

She will warm up to new people who give her the time and patience she requires to build that bond. \nKanji loves to play and is good with other dogs who are calm but playful and will be her fur friend. \nIt is best that there are no children in the home as it may trigger her past and the abuse she endured. Kanji loves to give hugs, go for walks, play fetch and run in the yard. She enjoys being read to and curling up next to you.\nSerious enquiries only.",

His previous owners were educated about dachshunds' weight and the risk of stairs but still allowed him to do stairs and get 6 pounds overweight. He is now back down to 14 pounds.\n\nOur must-haves for this sweet boy include:\n\n    A fenced yard\n    CANNOT do stairs/steps\n    No jumping or climbing\n    Another dog to keep him company if you have to be out of the house\n    His weight maintained at 13-14 pounds for his back's sake\n    No apartments or high rise apartments or condos\n    Needs a potty schedule\n\nDon't think because he's had IVDD that he can't run because he can keep up with the best of them, which is why he has to have a fenced yard. He loves kids, people, and attention. If you are home a lot he would be just fine as an only dog. He is a major toy destroyer. He loves to go for short walks and doesn't pull on the leash. Oscar will always walk with a bit of a wobble, but it only adds to his charm. Please give him a chance at a lasting home, he so deserves one!  \n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

Please give him a chance at a lasting home, he so deserves one!  \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

She was catheterized, treated and given medicine, but her owner never came back for her. Allegedly, her owner was a rapper, arrested on murder charges. After the vet filed abandonment paperwork, Babe was surrendered to us and got her freedom ride on June 2, 2020. At the emergency clinic, she was put on antibiotics and two other medications for urinary issues. She is urinating on her own just fine and is heartworm negative.\n\nABOUT BABE\n\nBabe is settling into foster care. Once she finishes up her medications, we will have her re-examined by our vet and most likely have a urinalysis done when she has been off the medications for 2 weeks. She is weary of new people, but once you gain her trust, she loves you completely and wholeheartedly. Due to her skepticism with new people, Babe will need an adult only, pit bull savvy home that will take the necessary steps and precautions to make her comfortable when meeting new people. She will meet the other dogs in her foster home once she has decompressed and fully settled into her foster home. For now, she is happy to see and sniff them through barriers like crates/gates and doesn't seem to be bothered. She will be available for adoption when she has decompressed and been fully vetted.\n\n*Please check back for updates on this beautiful lady*\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

He reminds us a lot of a dog we had years ago named Alvin. One of our awesome fosters stepped up and Grady got his freedom ride on May 21, 2020. He is being treated for his mange and underlying skin infection. He'll be fully vetted when his skin is healthy and his immune system is stronger.\n\nABOUT GRADY\n\nGrady is settling into foster care and proving to be a sweet guy. Because his skin was in such poor condition, it has been a slow process to start seeing noticeable improvement, but it's getting there! He's not a huge fan of his medicated baths, but he tolerates them. Grady LOVES to eat and is very food motivated. He is also house and crate trained. He absolutely loves people and the other dogs in his foster home. He was a little too friendly with the cats and couldn't take a hint so he would probably do best in a home without cats. Grady's skin has come a long way and immune system is getting better, but he's not quite ready to be fully vetted yet. Once we get the OK from our vet, he'll be neutered and ready to go into a forever home!\n\n*Please check back for updates!*\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

This little dude loves to ride in the car and hike on the trails (does over a mile on forested trails every morning). He is less hesitant now with new human friends and able to acclimate to new dog pals, albeit slowly and over time. This sweet, 38-pound pup is not one to go to a dog park as his ongoing fears of unknown dogs provoke him to shut down or go on the defense when introduced to new dogs. In his environment, once \"acclimated\" over time, he develops friendships with other well-balanced K9s, and once comfortable with them, he is the center of the party! Augie bunny hops from one location to another and one adventure to the next! He is pure love, giving smooches and cuddling as close as possible, often checking in with you! He will talk to you and wiggle that back-side to show you how glad he is to be with you!\n\nAugie must have:\n\n- a secure fenced-in yard.\n\n- a doggy playmate.\n\n- person(s) who are patient and loving . . and can spend time with him.\n\nAugie:\n\n- is very loving.\n\n- has done beautifully with children.\n\n- is 95% housetrained.\n\n- is nondestructive when left in a room with a playmate in your absence.\n\n- is fabulous on a leash and gentle leader; takes neighborhood walks each evening.\n\n- is super smart; takes direction and trains easily. Loves treats and wants to please.\n\n- barks/growls only when scared.\n\n- is a riot!\n\n- is extremely active.\n\n- thinks his person(s) hung the moon and makes you feel that way!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

            "description": "This is sweet and clever Callie. While only with her foster a short while we can share a few observations. She is house trained. Doesnt seem to have any problems with other dogs and would likely benefit from a playful friend. She and one of them never stop playing (check it out on facebook). LOVES playing in the baby pool that has a bit of water - not sure if this would correlate to a lake? Really needs a fenced back yard (she has a history of flight, and she likes to get a good run on - is in and out all day long). Great on a leash. Does well with a 15 year old (check out facebook) but not sure yet about younger. Also not sure about cats. Does not like crates and will hurt herself trying to get out of one (and is also quite loud) - but the good news is that she appears to be quite trustworthy when left out. She just watches out windows and takes naps. She has a bark but uses it judiciously. She is very loving and will seek out attention. She is not yet quite ready for hugs around her neck, but will curl up my your side and give lots of kisses. Approved adopters please ask to meet this lovely girl!\n\nWatch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/ \n\nAdoption fee: $375.00 Adoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee. All dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days. Our adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab at JRsPupsNStuff.org. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response. JR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

I was found running down the street in a bad section of town when I was a tiny baby.\nI have been having a great time with my foster brothers and sisters. I especially like the big guys mom calls Mastiffs, but I am not selective. I love the little babies too.\nI have been vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and have had my rabies shot so I won't get sick. I don't potty in the house, but we have a doggie door where I can go out when I need to. I DO NOT CRATE! As hard as mom tries, I hate being crated and will hurt myself. I usually spend time in the Dining room with my friends when Mom needs me to be secure. I love sleeping with with mom at night. I am looking for a forever home where I have at least one other fur friend so I am not lonely. I love to run around the back yard chasing all the other kids so it would be great if when you adopt me, you have another small friend for me.\nI don't know much about kids, but I think I would like an older boy or girl to call my own. Mom says - NO WAY CAN I BE ADOPTED by a small child. She would have to say NO WAY!\nIf you think I am as special as my foster mom says I am, please fill out an application. =========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

We do not ship our dogs and all adoptions are completed in person in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area. Hello, my name is Finn. I am six years old and I weigh about twenty pounds. I am a male terrier. I came to the rescue after I was found and taken to a local shelter. My family never came to claim me. That's alright with me because I needed the help of the rescue.\nWhen I came to the rescue I tested heartworm positive. I got heartworms from a mosquito bite but I could have died without treatment. Luckily the rescue had me treated and now I am proud to say I am heartworm negative. I won't lie to you, I can be very stubborn. I am energetic, spirited, loving, devoted and amusing too. I am aggressive toward other dogs and like to 'mark' all the trees. If you want me in your life you probably better have jack or parson russell experience because I need a strong leader in my home or I will take over and misbehave. I need to be your only pet. I act fearless but will hide behind you at the vet.\nI have been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. I have also had my teeth cleaned. My adoption fee is 175.00. The first step in adopting me, Finn, is to complete an application at dogsasfamily.org. You could be mine, forever.",

Willow is more confident so her sister Halo definitely looks to her for guidance. These little ladies are glued at the hip but love their people just as equally as each other, Halo is a little nervous and unsure in a new environment but it doesn't take long for her to open up and make herself at home. They are very calm indoors and you'll find them either sharing a toy at playtime or snoozing with each other, where one is the other is sure to follow. They are also pretty active in terms of the outdoors and love going on walks, they also love to do zoomies in the backyard so having a secure yard to play in is definitely a plus, they do bark at outside noises but are great at following direction and will stop when told to. They are good with other dogs but would prefer to be in a home as only dogs or only one other well adjusted dog. They are both eager to please, cuddly and learn very quickly. They are both so well behaved, crate trained and house trained.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

So he came safe under our wings \n\nAscoty is around 2 years old and not good with other dogs or cats . He has a high small prey drive .\n\nHe is full of energy and a sweet boy for experienced owners . He is probably a Norwegian elkhound/ shepherd mix . He does not have the curly tale of Elkhound but has the face .\n\nWe are looking for a serious candidate . A person who is active and walks and plays a few hours a day with him . This is not a dog that you just leave with his toy in the yard . \n\nWe only adopt out to Norwegian experienced owners \n\nAscoty is located in Middle Island . To become his new family please apply today by filling in the adoption  link to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one\n",

He was adopted from Halfway to Home in 2013 but his owner recently became ill and is no longer able to care for him so he has returned to the rescue to find his Forever home.  This sweet little guy is friendly but timid at first (particularly around men) so he will need a patient adopter who is willing to give him time to adjust to his new environment.   He would love to be your bed buddy if you so choose. Byron is also doggy-door and house-trained.  For more information about Byron, please call Sandy at tele# 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).",

            "description": "Meet this SWEETHEART named Roxy! She came into the shelter when her owner could no longer keep her May 25, 2020. She is a sweet and beautiful girl who needs a special home that will keep her safe and give her a great life. She wants to be the queen of the home so a home without children, & no other animals is very important for Roxy. She loves being around her human friends soaking up as much body rubs and affection as one has to share. She\u2019s always happy and wearing a smile and enjoys laying on her dog bed after playing a while. Roxy is 9 years old, current on shots, already spayed and seems house broken. Just a great girl! Might you have the most am amazing FOREVER home for this sweetie?! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

            "description": "In september 2019 my friend of 10 years Erin, who lived in louisiana, passed away suddenly from a heart condition. His father works 16 hour days in Texas making it impossible for him to care for the 2 senior family pets left behind. The likelihood of the dogs to end up in a shelter concerned me knowing that senior dogs rarely get adopted. After the funeral, I brought Hermes and gizmo on the long journey back to Tennessee with me and my family. All hermes and gizmo ever knew was the comfort and safety of their home with Erin. They are not used to a busy lifestyle as they were not socialized with other animals or children. Gizmo is a 13 year old male, neutered, chipped, and utd on his shots. He is very food motivated but will need to be kept on a diet so he doesnt over eat. He is allergic to chicken and freshly cut grass. He will get really red and itchy. He has a prescription for apoquel for these allergies. Gizmo is also afraid of thunderstorms and has a thunder shirt to help ease his anxiety. Gizmo like company especially when doing his business. If he doesnt have a bathroom buddy, he may wait and go in the house. Gizmo is not a fan of cats or small children. Hermes is a 10 year old male, neutered, chipped, and utd on shots. He is very introverted which I believe is due to him having sporadic seizures. He may take a while to warm up to someone new, but he is a very sweet boy once you earn his trust. Hermes is food agressive toward other animals. Gizmo knows to give him space. Hermes is also allergic to chicken and has storm anxiety. He has a thundershirt as well. He does well with not going potty in the house. They would do well in a home together with no other pets and little foot traffic. I",

When the owner didn't need them anymore he stopped feeding and caring for them! Optimus was found running loose and the shelter took him in. He had a lot of wounds and was in very rough shape. But now he is all healed up and ready to find his furever home!\n\nOptimus must be your only pet, but with that handsome face who needs any other animals?! He deserves all the love and then some! He absolutely adores people and would be fine with kids who are 10+. Optimus would love a fenced-in yard where he can roam and enjoy life. He has a little sway in his step so he doesn't run too much. This is likely due to being crated 24/7 for most of his life. Don't let that fool you! He still likes to play and go on adventures!\n\nIn order to get him to Buffalo, we need a foster home or adopter for him! If you think this sweet man would be a great addition to your family, please fill out an application!Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

            "description": "Meet Samson\nPoor Samson. This boy must have lived a lonely and frightening life by the time he arrived. Samson had been running around for weeks and nearly got hit by traffic before he was taken to Animal Control. We rescued Samson just as fast as we could and brought him to the safety of our shelter. We gave Samson some time to decompress. He\u2019s now ready for his forever family. \nSamson was so frightened when he first arrived. Every day he learns to trust a bit more. We think he must have been horribly abused and neglected. Samson is a Staffordshire terrier mix. He\u2019s about three years old. He weighs 65 lbs. He\u2019s extremely handsome with a beautiful coat and markings. \nSamson is an active boy. He loves having a fenced yard to freely run and romp. He loves taking walks. He sits patiently in his kennel to be leashed up, knowing he\u2019s going out to sniff and smell and stretch his legs. He can be a strong walker though and would do best with an active and agile person to keep up with him. He\u2019s extremely smart and has picked up many commands \u2013 sit, wait, stay, shake, kiss, and hug \u2013 the last two are our favorites!\nSamson sits and waits for treats, and he\u2019ll take them gently from your hand. He loves attention, when he knows you. And he\u2019s so appreciative of the kind and gentle hands that pet him. He is often seen laying on his blanket quietly chewing on his Nyla bone. A kennel, a blanket and a bone must seem like heaven for this boy. We think Samson might be house-trained. He keeps his kennel clean and seems to do his business outside. \nSamson is selective about other dogs. He doesn\u2019t seem to care for \u2018alpha\u2019 male dogs, but enjoys the company of females and younger puppies. Samson has encountered cats and he will lunge for them, but not aggressively. It seems he\u2019s more curious, but we\u2019ll test for potential adopters. Samson would do best in a quiet, yet active home, given he\u2019s still unsure of the world around him. Samson wants to engage with his person and be a part of their activities. He wants to know he belongs to someone. He\u2019s very loyal to those who have shown him kindness and spend time with him. Patience and a steady-hand will help Samson continue to blossom. \nHe\u2019s a gem in the making and just needs some continued TLC to ease his fears and let him know how important he is. If you\u2019re looking to make a wonderful dog\u2019s dream of a loving home come true, Samson may be your boy.\nSamson will be neutered, micro-chipped and fully vetted before going home. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy. Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n\n\n",

He will require a lot of grooming (Huskies shed a lot year round and also blow their undercoats in spring) but the good news is that he does not seem to mind it. He loves treats and is very good at sitting for them. His is said to especially like watermelon and carrots for a snack. Huskies tend to be stubborn - they like to do what they want - so training is typically beneficial for this breed. Cody Boy is crate trained, but can be protective of his food and his space especially around small kids and other dogs, so he would do best in an adult-only home.\n",

She has lived a long life full of love and is now looking for the Pyrfect retirement home that will show her just as much love as her owner did. Star is a sweet, low-energy girl who wants to be with her humans. She is house trained and absolutely loves going for walks. Star gets a little anxious when left alone but rewards you with lots of love and affection when you stay home with her. She is extremely loyal and will follow you wherever you go. Star thinks she is a lap dog and will climb right up for a cuddle :) She needs lots of reassurance that she is safe during thunderstorms and like a typical Pyr, she will protect your home from any incoming threats or intruders. Star is looking for a quiet home to live out her golden years--which means being the only dog as she becomes a 'Queen' when encountering other dogs and wants them banished from her kingdom so she can be the center of your attention and relax in peace. Star has lived with cats and does great with children who understand how to respectfully interact with an older dog. Star\u2019s foster family says she is the sweetest, most lovable dog they have ever known. If you can give this girl the 'Star'  retirement she is looking for, apply for this sweet girl today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He also enjoys baths and his chew toys can keep him busy. He LOVES car rides. \nJax loves attention and wants to be with you. He is a fun active boy and would make a great jogging buddy. He also likes to just chill at home. \nAnd he's super smart: Jax is taking K9 nose work classes where he searches out essential oil on a tip of a Q tip.\nJax responds well to direction and is a quick learner. He will do best in a calm household with access to a yard and a person/family who is interested in continuing to give him a loving and structured life-style.\nJax' situation has become urgent, as his rescuer is a senior lady and can no longer care for him!\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com",

She will attach herself to your hip once she has bonded and it will be so hard to shake this lovable, quirky, fun girl. She enjoys moments of basking in the sun and playing with her stuffed animals. Greta has looks to die for and expressions that will make you smile from ear to ear. She is a shy girl at time when meeting new people and needs a few moments. She thrives on a daily routine and the consistency of patience. She will do best for people that understand she needs this to adjust to a new home and environment. Greta is waiting patiently in a foster home and adjust well with her crating and walking.",

Norman was surrendered to a shelter last year, where a volunteer decided to change his life forever and bring him home to be safe. The shelter has limited capacity to place giant breeds, so she reached out to us and Norman is officially a BDHP man! This sweet old guy is very scared of strangers and needs a calm, quiet retirement home that can give him lots of belly rubs. He knows to sit, roll over, and shake, and loves to meander around his backyard and take naps. Norman is working on his manners with other dogs but is content to sniff them through fences and hang out by himself. Due to his fear, he will require a home with older children (if any) and a quieter environment. If you can provide a retirement home for this special guy to live out his golden years, he will say \"thanks\" with lots of snuggles and kisses!\n\nGolden Rewards Program All of our adoptable grey muzzled gentle giants who are at least 7 years young are available for adoption for a reduced $250 donation!\n\nAlready a Golden Rewards Club member? If you've adopted a senior gentle giant from Big Dogs Huge Paws in the past, we have great news for you! Adopt a second senior for a Golden Rewards Club adoption donation of $200, and if it's your third senior dog adoption we are offering a special Golden Rewards Club reduced donation of only $150! Why wait?\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "Meet Danielle... This cute little girl was picked up as a stray and just a few days later became ill with the deadly parvovirus. Thankfully, she\u2019s one tough cookie and beat the odds and is now happy and healthy. She appears to be a terrier mix of some sort with her cute little nub tail. She photographes bigger than she is. She only weighs around 15 lbs and will not get any bigger. She\u2019s playful and full of personality. She definitely would benefit from having another pup, kids and a yard to play in. She\u2019s the perfect family pet. She\u2019s utd, dewormed and spayed. This girl is ready for her forever home. Get your apps in and don\u2019t miss out on this cuteness. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

Being older and having to be the only pet already makes her chances slim to find her forever family easily but having cancer and only a short time to live was the ultimate heartache.  She came to us physically broken but mentally too. She is soft with her humans. Pumpkin was dropped at the shelter with a large mouth tumor and a giant tumor on her mammory glads. After biopsies the results determined cancer. We took her on as a hospice case and just wanted to give her the best life she could have until the end. We took the risk and had surgery to remove the mouth tumor and mammory tumor. We have been surprised by getting good clean margins and a good prognosis for the future. PLEASE PLEASE help us find her a home to be spoiled, cuddled and loved!!!!",

Luckily she was adopted, but unfortunately, Mochi started having some medical issues that may have been caused when she was tossed like garbage over the fence. She has some neurological issues that cause her to bunny hop with her front feet and her head bobs when she runs. Despite these little tics, she is still a very active girl that loves to play! She has also almost completely lost her eyesight (she has 5% vision). Due to her blindness, Mochi needs routine and a calm environment. Her blindness will cause her to be startled with fast movements or loud noises (understandably so!). Her first adopter did not know how to care for a blind girl, so she was not set up for success. It was a very active household with kids, and that was not the place for Mochi. When dealt with properly, however, she does great with people and dogs! She allows herself to be handled and has done well with her vet. Mochi just needs someone who will be patient and understanding that she has special needs! Will that be you?\nMochi requires a home with a yard. She doesnt like to go on walks. Her favorite thing is to dig for sticks and roots in her yard. No children please. No cats. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nON A WALK: https://youtu.be/Mvoc9yIg1NM\n\nVIDEO OF HER STORY: https://youtu.be/dy9CzULChd4",

I love to run, jump, and play, (especially with toys that squeak!) but at the end of the day I just really would love a family who can spend quality time with me (which sometimes means naps, because who doesn't like naps?!).\n\nI know how to Sit, Lay Down, and how to jump in the bathtub for a bath! I do a great job going in and out of my crate nicely, and I can walk on leash with a harness!\n\nI lived with a cat friend for a while but then some guy who also called himself Doctor told me I was allergic to my cat friend! I was devastated. But I've been much less itchy since we stopped hanging out. I dunno what that's about.\nI do like hanging out with dog friends occasionally, but I might prefer to be an only dog... I'm a little bit of an attention hog. \n\nI'm up to date on my shots, neutered, and housebroken!\nMy foster mom can tell you about my allergy meds, favorite foods and treats so that I stay healthy and happy in your home! My foster mom says any family interested in me better brace themselves for a lifetime of wiggles, love, and tug-o-war!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Dr. Who, please email creativecontributions@mail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**COURTESY POST**\n-Lost Our Home occasionally receives requests to cross-post or courtesy-post animals on our website for greater exposure. \n\n-Unless specifically stated to the contrary, Lost Our Home will not have evaluated, met, or interacted with these animals.\n\n-Lost Our Home cannot attest to the temperament, health, or suitability of these animals.\n\n-Lost Our Home recommends that anyone interested in adopting one of these dogs discuss the animal's temperament with its current guardians.\n\n-Lost Our Home assumes no liability, financial, or legal responsibility for said animals.",

            "description": "Tye is a 1 1/2 year old Cane Corso that has been through so much in his young life.  He was found as a stray puppy in January, 2020.  He had cherry eyes, which we repaired, and Tye was quickly adopted.  Unfortunately, Tye was returned for not getting along with the other dog in the home, and returned yet again due to his owner's not being able to care for a large dog.  The second time Tye came back, he arrived with an injured hind leg.  We sent Tye for surgery for a luxating patella and then he spent several weeks doing physical therapy.  Tye is finally ready for the best home ever!  Tye is such a sweet, goofy boy.  All he wants is to offer you his big paw and get lots of attention.  Tye has not had much training in his life and he can be a little mouthy while playing, so he'll need a home with older kids.  He also needs a pet-free home.  He's just a giant puppy that loves to run and play. He's a big leaner, leaning against you to get as much attention as you'll give him. He would love to be offered a great home where he can stay forever and ever! File#29445 6/26/20\nCall 609-693-1900 or email: office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Tye.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

Even when other dogs are passing by his nose is to the ground.\nDid someone mention a car ride? Crosby is your fella ready for an adventure. He enjoys his time in the car keeping his eye out for interesting sights to focus on.\nCrosby enjoys the company of people. He will follow you around and becomes vocal when you leave. His way of saying \" come back soon, please.\"\nCrosby is a lovable guy who would truly enjoy the company of someone who is looking for a buddy to share life's adventures with. \nCrosby has a generous sponsor that is willing to cover a portion of her adoption fee(s).",

Cali is a big personality and needs a super active home that can keep both her body and mind tired.  She is very friendly when meeting new people.  Cali will need management surrounding her crate, food, and toys.  We have started her on a management program that is working well and will need to be followed in her new home.  She needs to have leadership defined in a non confrontational way and does best with male humans.  Cali is good off leash and loves to hike and run in the woods.  She loves car rides and is eager to go off on an adventure. Cali is ok with most dogs, although would prefer to live as a solo dog or with a goofy male that allows her to be the boss.  She is ok with dog savvy cats who don't run.  Cali is house trained and has nice manners inside.  Please have breed experience prior to applying.\n\nLevel: Red\nWeight: 50 lbs.\nAdoption fee: $300",

He was obeying outside off-leash the second day we had him. He can be left alone and does not need to be crated. He is extremely loyal to whoever treats him well. He's had some trauma in his past and he needs a little special attention and patience when he is eating, as he sometimes feels the need to guard his food until he trust that you arent going to take it away. He gets along with most other dogs with a proper introduction. Friendly with people. Do not know how he is around kids or cats. He likes to ride in the car, go for walks, and romp and play in the yard. \n\nORIGINAL POST: Rocky is a ten (10) year old lab/mastiff mix that was picked up by a shelter and stayed there for over a month. We took him in and were lucky enough to find a great foster who has shown him more love and care in a few weeks than he has probably had in his life. He is a big 80 pounder and moves a little slow, but is overall healthy and ready for his new forever life. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application",

As you can see, Liberty is a young beautiful white mixed breed dog. She had two puppies with her, London and Lincoln and they had no trouble at all getting adopted, being as gorgeous as their momma. Liberty is an extremely sweet people person dog, who will get along with other dogs (her size or smaller) after a slow introduction. She would thrive in a home free from little kids, preferring kids who are older and more calm. Ideaally, a fenced in backyard would work best for her because while she walks on a leash and will potty that way, she prefers the comfort of familiar surroundings and safety. Crowed places such as dog parks and events are not the best venue for her. Her crate is a must and cannot be lined with blankets or pads as she will tear through them. Liberty has put in the hard work with a trainer and for that person who is willing to understand her and put in the time with her, she will be an amazing and loyal addition to their home. Is that person you?",

He's a stunning little guy, found as a stray, who has many entertaining and pleasing attributes! He's doing great in his foster home and enjoys his bunkmates, but he's anxious to hit the road and find a forever person or family he could love and enjoy life with. Rowdy needs a doggie door that leads to a yard he can run in. Baby gates are a no-win since he can clear one in an easy bound! Rowdy also needs another doggie buddy living in the home. Rowdy is definitely more gazelle than dachshund - he hates a crate and can clear the babygate in a single bound. We think his mix might well be Miniature pincher/dachshund.\nIf you're looking for a best friend and companion to share life with, please fill out an adoption application for Rowdy.",

I'm 3 years old and I've got a bully attitude, gallons of drool and rollz for days.  I've been trained by No Bull Rehab and have learned the skills to help me be successful in my forever home. I don't see very well, which caused me some challenges at first but now that I'm more comfortable, I'm even conquering ramps and steps.  I need a home with NO kids and NO other animals that can devote the time to coming to Covina to work with my trainers.  My ideal home will sign up for 4-5 sessions with my trainer, learn about me and my training, learn the tools they use to help me communicate properly and will listen and follow ALL instructions given. My adoptive home should be aware that my trainers mean business! Everything I learned will be transferred and implemented into my new home for total success! Think you've got what it takes?

He does like playing with most female dogs his own size, but again a proper introduction would be required. Handsome is treat motivated and knows basic commands.

I love to cuddle on the couch and watch a good movie. I love to go on walks and hikes. I can also spend all day in my bed being lazy! I am a young male just searching for love! I am neat, tidy, very potty trained, and enjoy food and treats. You see, I'm a dog and my name is Scooby. I am 5 years old, a Cairn terrier mix, and weigh about 14 pounds full grown. I am professionally trained to sit, lay down, stay, heel, and come when on leash. I come with two additional training sessions. I take a while to bond with people and greatly prefer females over males. I am leery of strangers but once I know you my eyes will light up and I'll dance for you. I have been waiting a long time for a home since I do not make a great first impression. I would do great as on only dog as I entertain myself with toys and don't like to share them. I'm not fond of dogs, cats or kids. I'm great in a car and love walks and hikes. I am house broken, and kennel trained. I sleep in my foster mom's bedroom in a crate quiet as a mouse. I love being able to see my person sleeping. I must have a kid and cat free home, and I must have a yard no apartments. --- He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, vet checked and microchipped.

I'm a sweet silly fun loving little WUGGIE WOO....BUT I like to guard things like socks and random items but not food; so I need to go to an EXPERIENCED BULLY BREED OWNER.. Someone who knows this behavior and can \"manage\" it and can work with me on it. ADULT ONLY and NO KIDS. I've been around other dogs and seem to be fine with them, but I've never lived with other dogs,  so my social skills in sharing my space may not be soo great.. so best if I'm an ONLY DOG so I can get ALL the ATTENTION unless again you're an experienced bully breed owner and can introduce me properly. I've never met any cats so not sure how I will be with them. I'm housebroken and leash trained and know basic commands. I may be a little guy but I'm a BIG LOVE & I'm full of wuggie wiggles and wags! I'm ready for a new life adventure with someone who will make me their CO-PILOT!!! Will that be you? \n\nFor an application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG\n\n\n",

He can be unsure of strangers and touch, and  his loyalty is strong \u2014 leading him to be somewhat protective of  his human(s).  With some time, training and exposure to new people and situations, Raja will learn that he can relax and enjoy his life as a puppy! He\u2019s a little shy and cautious with new people at first, so proceeding slowly to gain his trust and favor will go a long way. Gentle introductions and getting him used to new sights and smells will help Raja live his best life. He does seem comfortable around other pups, and is happy to be in doggy playgroup. Raja is ready to meet you and bond with you for a lifetime to come! \n\nVIDEO !!\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

He will dig out of yard if left alone, so does need company! If left alone, he probably does best if crated. \nWe would recommend he go to a home with confident adults only.\n\nYaso rides well in car.  He also walks well on leash. \n\nAs his foster Mom says, he's a \"real lover boy\".\n\nWe have not tested him with cats, other small critters, or small children yet, but would expect him to have a normally high prey drive for smaller, wild animals (squirrels, rabbits etc).\n\nContact us for more information, and visit our website to complete an adoption application form:\n\nwww.twodogfarms.com/adopt\n\nAdoption fees are $350.00.\n\ninfo@twodogfarms.com",

I am a 3 year old, neutered, happy go lucky boy!!\n\nI have had PROFESSIONAL training, and come with additional FREE training to my adoptive family!\n\nI absolutely love the water!! It would be wonderful to be adopted into a home with a pool, or at least a kiddie pool in the backyard!\n\nI am friendly with other dogs, but am not real good with small ones, so I probably will not do well with cats.\nI also would do best in a home without smaller kids-- 10+ would be best.\n\nI have my calm moments and then I have moments where I can be playfull and want to run around and have fun. I am already crate trained and housebroken and I have learned all my basic obedience commands including how to Heel on leash!\n\nI have one quirk, I am absolutely terrified of large brimmed hats and sunglasses. So whoever my adopter is needs to be aware that these scare me.\n\nSnooks adopter will be required to continue with (8)\n\nfollow up training sessions with Partners in Cave Creek (Free of charge) during his Foster With Intent to Adopt trial period. This way, his adopter will learn the same tools that Snook has been taught with, to continue with his success of being the perfectly mannered dog!\n\nIf you would like to meet Snook, please visit our site for our application! www.underdogaz.com",

She loves everyone she meets, even children, and loves to be helping you with your day to day activities. If you work from home or are gone for only short periods of time in a day, this would be great for her! Gypsy is seeking a home where she will be the only animal. She is okay with some dogs as a walking companion only, but will not be happy sharing her space with dogs, cats or small animals. She can be a very active girl but will relax once in your company. Gypsy enjoys going for walks and does really well on leash! She is the perfect co-pilot in the car, too!\n\nGypsy's adoption fee is $250 and includes her spay, microchip and current vaccines and preventatives. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and vet checks, background checks, and a home visit.",

He seems to like other dogs and could possibly live with a cat, although we haven't done an official cat test with him. This cute little guy is well mannered and so sweet. A cuddle bug but still at the age he can rough around and be super playful when he's amped up. He loves his walks and, although always very excited to go, he does calm down on leash. He likes car rides and makes a great navigator. He enjoys playing with toys and a good old chew bone is always welcome. Jaxy does have some food aggression and will need to be fed in a crate. Jaxy is 6 years old and weighs approximately 40 lbs. For an appointment to meet him, please submit the adoption application (no commitment) found on our website, www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoption counselor will get in touch with you.",

When she was surrendered to us, her high energy and lack of manners made her a great candidate for our prison training program. She has done well there, learning her basics and leash walking. .\n\nLilly loves to play. She has a big red ball, that she will chase for hours. She would be an excellent addition to any soccer team! She is sweet and loving to humans, but also very independent. She's a great size, and just beautiful. \n\nThis girl needs a home without small animals or cats, She would probably prefer to be the only dog in the household. Children over ten who could handle her exuberance would find a wonderful companion to grown up with.\n\nLilly can climb and jump just about anything, so she must have yard with a secure fence at least 6 feet tall.\n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $400  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

We don't know why he's being overlooked. \n\nSatchmo was named after the famous Louis Armstrong...and they both think this world is way too wonderful to still be waiting a foster and forever family. He loves everyone he meets and is ready to come home with you!  \n\nSatchmo came to us from the Young County shelter. He is super outgoing and loves people, but can get a bit frustrated with other dogs but it depends on the situation so a home without other dogs would be best. He just wants to chill and love, and be loved. The shelter thinks he is around 8 years old.  But, the good news is that he is fully vetted and heart worm negative! Move in ready!\n\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $150 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home.

She is spayed and up to date on her vaccines to the only thing missing is you! \n\nThe start of her life was not the best therefore it takes a few times meet her for her to trust you. Once she does look out, you would have a forever best friend! She loves to go for walks, snuggle on the couch or play with toys.\n\nUnfortunately she will need a quiet home without kids, cats or dogs. Would do best with a single person or a couple that does not have a ton of visitors. Please contact us to set up a meeting!!",

She loves to jump and run and she greets everyone exuberantly.\n\nShe loves to soak up attention from her people, but can also entertain herself with toys and chews when you are busy. She is potty and house trained. She is good with cats and older children. Sonata needs to be the only dog in her forever home. She will require a home with a 5-6ft fence due to her leash reactivity and would not be a good fit for an apartment.\n\nSonata's adoption fee is $300. Meet and greets will happily be arranged for approved adopters...please visit rescuedohio.org to apply.",

The first home had two 7 year old twins and the dog loved the entire family but he didn\u2019t want other people to go around the kids.  He was a super protective but now in these times he needs to be just the family dog that doesn\u2019t have a lot of people coming to the house .  We found a wonderful lady that had him for a month and she offered to write us a letter to tell people inquiring why she decided to give him up.  .  We personally love this dog.  He is super smart and we are going to require that he goes to a home with a minimum of 5 ft fence and preferably a Privacy Fence.    NO EXCEPTiONS.    He actually jumped a 4 foot fence with a family that loved him like we do.  He is microchipped.  He is current on all of his vaccinations.  For more information call Ken at 636-388-1636.  He will be happy to answer any questions you have.  Also if the 2nd owner sends us the promised letter about Ricky we will be happy to share the information she told us.  He did have training but I never found out what the trainer and the owner worked on so I\u2019ll let her tell us just what he was taught.  I know he does the sit and lay down because I saw that when he was listed at the dog pound on their listing about the dog needing a home.  He was housebroken in both of his homes so no problems with this.",

            "description": "I am a cat in a dog's body, so please treat me like you would a cat. Except I'm better than a cat, because I'm a dog'. Albus is still figuring out how this beloved family dog thing works. It takes him a bit of time to warm up to new people, but the more you spend time with him, the more he'll start nudging your hand and leaning into you for pets. When he's really comfortable, he'll plow his head right into your hands and beg for massages. He's very in tune with his person's feelings, and will put his head on your knee, looking lovingly into your eyes, falling head over heels in love. When he smiles, Albus' face shines as bright as the sun. Once you've earned his trust, this sweet guy will do anything for you. He's very treat-motivated (and loves apples!), so that can help speed things along. In his foster home, Albus has proven to be an excellent houseguest. He's house-trained, does well left home alone, and loves hanging out in his crate. It's his safe space and he sleeps all through the night in there. He also thrives on routines, especially for feeding. Albus has a nice low to medium energy level, walks easily on leash and gives amazing eye contact. While at the shelter, he enjoyed going to playgroup with his canine friends and could go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. Albus is a smart pup and has made great strides in APA!'s Total Obedience Program, which is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Albus has a personalized training plan to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He's learning skills like sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, answering to 'sit' and 'down' until told 'free,' coming when called and 'place,' which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. And as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This sweet old soul would love a quiet home where he can slip into a nice routine. Come meet Albus, he'll be the most loving and loyal companion you could hope for! Follow Albus on Instagram @albus_thepupper.",

Sage can be very timid around new people, and especially in new situations, so she is going to need someone willing to work on desensitizing her to the things of the world. She is able to jump fences, so she really needs a secure yard or a plan to keep her in safe when her owners are away. She is a great loving dog, who bonds quickly to her people, and is loyal to a fault. She LOVES water, and hiking, and being able to run. She would make a good hiking, running, or even biking buddy! \n\nWe require a home check as well as a meet-and-greet with all dogs before adoption, and we will not ship any dogs.\n \nAll RSQ Dogs are chipped, fixed and up to date on shots before adoption. If it is not a local adoption, arrangements for these services must be made before the dog leaves. \n\nTo learn more about RSQ Dogs or to fill out an adoption form for any of our animals, check out the RSQ Dogs website at https://www.rsqdogsutah.org/animals-for-adoption",

Expressive. Sleeps in her kennel or on the couch/bed. Great house dog. No squirrel can get past her.\n\nShe is good with large siblings if introduced properly but isn't a fan of small dogs. Needs a large yard and would be a great companion for a single person or active family. No treat can escape her snoot.\n\nLincoln is a beauty queen. She is the perfect dog.\n\nLincoln is being fostered in Houston, TX. We  use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month and can provide references from very happy families that have adopted from us.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Lincoln please email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com",

He likes to play ball, takes his treats nicely and likes to kiss on the first date.

But he sure does love his toys and treats and when he trusts you, he lets go all of the things he is picky about!!

            "description": "Sugar belonged to the surrendering owner's husband.  When he passed away and she was unable to care for her or brother, Jackson.  They were kenneled outside so appreciate being in a safe, warm house.  \n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in June 2018, Sugar is ready to sweeten your life.  She's house-trained when kept on a regular schedule and leash-savvy.  She's a little nervous in cars, but enjoys the adventure once she arrives.  \n\nSugar is good with people and polite male dogs.  She doesn't like female dogs, but is well-behaved when on leash.  She has been around cats and will play chase-the-cat, but can be called off.\n\nShe has been invited to visit the neighborhood daycare and loves the little ones.  She would prefer to be an only dog in her home as she loves her people and would rather not share attention.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience.\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. 90 lb pinto seeking forever homeCiro knows that happiness is a byproduct of other activities...Adopt him and he'll show you?!!! Ciro is a young boy that can be selective about the humans he chooses but once you are in, YOU ARE IN!! He wants to please but also needs a little time getting to know you before he will follow your lead. He enjoys walks and walks well on leash. He loves playing in the play yard and enjoys most other friendly large dogs. He especially likes other young, playful, females if they are introduced correctly and the girl appreciates a good leader. He sits for treats and is a special young man that deserves the best!! He can be jumpy/mouthy and can sometimes test his boundaries, like any akita male, so he needs a breed experienced owner who will understand his personality. He is very affectionate to the people he chooses and as loyal as they come!! Due to his choosiness with people and rough play style, we don't recommend him in a home with children under 18 or small animals.\n\nMeet him at #AkitaRanch 28930 Ellis Ave Romoland CA\n\nEmail: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption informationVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

I have such a fun personality as you can see from my photos. I love to make people laugh and feel happy. I've been patiently waiting for so long for love and happiness. I am happy, but i would be so much happier in a forever home. I prefer to be your only animal at this time..\nI just need a little patience to warm up, it doesn't take me long at all. I need a home with no small children for now. As I am a little shy at first and I wouldn't want to get scared. I absolutely love water, hikes and car rides too! I ride very well in a car. I love to cuddle after I get to know you. I am very well trained, and know all my basic commands. I pull a little at first on a leash, but I calm down after a bit and with guidance. I will need a patient home to decompress in, as I have been in boarding for over a year. But I promise I learn fast and I will show you a fun time for sure......\nI am a 4yr Am Staff/Cattle dog mix, neutered, current on shots. He is very loving and affectionate. .\nPlease call 520-800-4633 remember my name is Bolt ask for DDEE and say I'm in boarding in phoenix. I can't wait to meet you. Please if you can call rather than email\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

She has been with them for a few years as she is shy with new people. \n\nIt is imperative that she comes up and goes straight to her adoptive family,  so she doesn't have too many changes in her life. Her adoptive family must be dedicated and fully committed to her, as change us not easy for her. She is about 6 years old and has been in rescue most of her life. She is a sweet girl and just really needs someone to take her in and give her the loving family she deserves.  \nThis is cross post only. I have no other information.  You need to contact the rescue below and complete an application. Thank you\n\n Paws of Marion at www.pawsofmarion. org",

He is what we call a low rider,, short legs and longish body.  He's a very smart dog and can be a little shy with new people, but loves to run and play with his rescue buddies.  He seems to be pretty well house trained  and does pretty well on a leash.  He needs a home with a yard as he loves to run and play, he loves toys and will sit patiently for his treats.  He does not have a mean bone in his body.  He absolutely needs a doggy buddy to play with and a fenced yard\n\nOUR RESCUE POLICY - It is our rescue policy for all our dogs that we require a home with no children under the age of 8, and experienced dog owners only.  \n\n \n\nThe total adoption fee of  between $550  and includes the required interstate health certificate and transport , spay/neuter, shots including rabies, bordatella, parvo, distemper and canine influenza, and microchip.

Here I am! I'm a handsome, super sweet pittie-mix prince - estimated to be about 2 years old and 60 pounds - who is available for adoption through Fetching Tails Foundation. My foster mom says I am a good mix of active goofball and cuddly. When I'm in a playful mood, I enjoy chasing my tail, playing with all the toys and bones I can get my paws on, and running some zoomies. Once I am all tired out from our fun and adventures, I am a pro snuggler and will make myself at home next to you on the couch. Because of my mouthy play style I would do best in a home with children who are older (10+) while I work on my manners and learn more appropriate ways to play. I get along with other dogs with the help of slow introductions and time to get to know each other, but no kitty cats for me, please.  \n\nAs a young guy, I need a family who will commit to continuing training with me so I can be the best Fella around! I'm potty trained and love my crate; I do fine in my personal man cave while my foster parents are at work during the day and sometimes I even take my toys and go rest in my crate without prompting! I am a talker so I would prefer a single-family house without shared walls instead of an apartment or townhouse, and a fenced yard that I could enjoy would be a big bonus! I'm working on basic commands including sit, wait, stay, and down, and I would love to learn even more with you by my side. I aim to please my people and just need some guidance and structure to thrive. Do you think I could be the goofy and loving Fella for you? Please get in touch with my friends at Fetching Tails soon! I can't wait to meet you!\n\nKisses and cuddles,\nFella\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess. If any questions please email us!",

The lady was crying because I looked so bad. I have had lots and lots of puppy in my day and so I was in pretty bad shape. I was so, so skinny too. Now I look great and ready for my new family. I look totally different from when I came here and the lady that brought me here gets updates on me and she is so happy for me. She too wants me to find a loving, caring home. I do not ever had to have any more kids to take care of. When I get my new family someone will be taking care of little me. I am about three years old. I sometimes get to come into the office and I have the best time playing with the other dogs.... We play with the toys and have the best time... I love it. People do not recognizes me either.Just the other day  when I was in the office I heard someone say \" Is that Judith!  Wow, she looks so good\". I may have been a stray but now I am wonderful and looking for my furever home.  My adoption fee is $100 and this includes my shots, worming and yea,,,,, spaying..... no more kids ! Also micro chipping.  If you would like to adopt me do not come to the shelter.  You must first call, email, or  Facebook the shelter to fill out an application for me and then an appointment to come get me and finish the adoption  process. I am looking forward to that day.... I am Judith",

This compact, blue pit might seem reticent when she first meets you, but once you have earned her trust, Dollop will become your best bud. \n\nWhen she is properly introduced, Dollop does very well with dogs: she has several canine friends at the shelter and interacts with them so well!! She would do best, however, in an adult-only home (plus potential dog siblings) because of her initial shyness when meeting new people. \n\nDollop has completed some training sessions during her stay at the shelter, and she is a quick and motivated learner. Her ideal forever family would be excited to continue with her training and would be willing to be patient with her as she adjusts. Because she has lived in a foster home with another dog before, PAWS is confident that Dollop could be the right girl for you!\n\nPlease reach out to PAWS if you are interested in meeting this dog!",

He is about 2 years old and is a beautiful black & white color. He loves to chew bones and is mellow but VERY strong. Bruno Mars is a big fella at around 70 lbs. He needs an active home, with a mom or dad who is able to wrangle a big guy.\n\nHe is currently taking training classes to learn how to not pull on a leash and not get overexcited when seeing other dogs. While he's been mostly all right around other dogs, he has become aggressive a couple of times. We are looking for a home where he could be the only dog and have all the attention. We are working on teaching him to greet other dogs appropriately with training right now, but this is mostly so that he will behave like a gentleman in public. Bruno is housebroken and crate trained.\n\nSomeone who has a flexible schedule and the time to train, exercise, and properly care for him is a must. He needs focus and attention. He really is a big teddy bear though! He would LOVE to snuggle on the couch or sleep in a bed, he is a really chill dog. He needs a good, safe, secure yard to play in. He would make a great hiking buddy. But due to his size, we would recommend no toddlers or young children in his new home. \n\nBruno is currently in foster in the Seattle area. His adoption fee includes his neuter, up-to-date basic vaccines, rabies vaccine, and microchip.\n\nPlease complete an application at the following link:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nQuestions?

He absolutely LOVES running and playing in a securely fenced yard but would also do well as a walking, jogging or running partner where all activities take place on a leash. \u00a1Queso! is housebroken, has good in-home manners, and does well when crated. \n\n$0 ADOPTION FEE, ADOPTION FEE HAS BEEN SPONSORED! \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nA Fenced Yard is preferred for \u00a1Queso! but not required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nOur adoption area, unless otherwise specified in their bio, is within a two hour radius of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue for adult dogs, and within a one hour radius for puppies. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.

            "description": "Rio is a nine year old husky/shepherd mix who weighs 55 pounds. Rio was dumped on a very compassionate woman who did what she could to help Rio heal her wounds, but could only do so much on her own. She was brought into the rescue and is already doing so much better. We also discovered that Rio is deaf. This doesn't stop her from getting all the attention that she wants. This girl is a love bug, who prefers to be the only dog in the household. Rio loves people and will follow you around wherever you go. She is a sweet older lady that needs some tender loving care. Rio is up-to-date on all of her vaccinations. She is also house and crate trained.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rio please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

Has had some obedience(this does not exclude our mandatory adoption clause of a full round of obedience being required - NO EXCEPTIONS!)\n\nTo read more about BHRR's Caramel and to stay updated on his progress, please follow his blog at http://www.birchhaven.org/archives/category/adoption/caramel - CUT & PASTE the link into your browser. Petfinder no longer allows for html links.\n\nNOTE: All blogs(scroll to the very bottom and then read upwards) and our PetFinder animal lists are kept utd so yes, BHRR's Caramel is still available.\n\nPlease do not EMAIL asking such and, please do go to his blog to read about him before contacting us. Almost all of your questions will be answered in his very detailed blog. READ the blog from the bottom up once on the blog.\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with BHRR's adoption mandates, processes plus policies before contacting us about a BHRR animal.\n\nOur PetFinder and our www.birchhaven.org websites will answer most of your questions. Therefore, do not contact us asking us what our policies are,or what our adoption area is or what his adoption fee is. BHRR is a federally registered NPO operated solely by Volunteers. We are NOT a shelter or a pound.\n\nYou CANNOT just drop by to visit him. He resides in a loving home, not a kennel and BHRR has a thorough adoption process to determine if any home is a right match personality fit.\n\nWhen submitting your adoption application contract for BHRR's Caramel; please also include a short introduction re: your home etc.\n\nWe DO NOT respond to inquires to adopt nor any emails that do not include an application along with the non-refundable application fee.\n\nNOTE: WE also will not respond to any emails that only ask a one liner re: adoption fees. The adoption cost(from a r/q Rescue) or purchase cost(if you purchase from a reputable/quality Breeder is the LEAST that you shall pay over the lifetime of proper care of your pet).",

He does not like small spaces. So he would love a forever home with a nice sized yard.\nHe came to us because his people did not have permission to have him where they live.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Smokey is current on his vaccinations, neutered and Heartworm negative. This boy tips the scale around 75 pounds and was living 24/7 in a outdoor pen. He is now in foster care, enjoying blankets and his very first dog bed.  We are told he loves affection,  cuddling and toys. Smokey is a very active boy and will need a family that can give him lots of exercise.\n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you are interested in this wonderful pet, please complete an online application at sqrescueinc.org. Incomplete or missing information will delay processing. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs outside of our scheduled adoption events.

            "description": "Zion is a beautiful tan and dark brown brindle color with white on his chest and belly. One ear sticks straight up and the other flops down.\n He may not be named for Zion Williamson, but he would definitely shatter the Duke canine vertical jump record! In addition to his impressive jumping ability (dont worry, he has had no interest in jumping fences), Zions award-winning smile and incredible athleticism continue the analogy. Zion could certainly beat Carolina down the courtor at least accompany you on a nice jog, followed up by some play time. As an added bonus, Zion sometimes uses walks as an opportunity to get in some resistance training, although he has been using a no-pull harness to tamp down on his fitness urges. He also loves to stop and sniff. Everyone has to take it easy sometimes, after all! Zions amiable nature makes him a good companion for dogs who can match his energy level, although he definitely has a dominant personality. On leash, Zion has done extremely well with every dog he has met. He might not have a degree from Duke, but Zion is an A+ student. He can already sit, lay down, stay, leave it and give a nice high five. Because he is so smart, Zion will need a good coach to keep his progress going. After a hard day of press interviews, this social butterfly loves nothing better than to curl up on the couch and cuddle. He falls into a deep sleep with his head in your lap and wags his adorable, crooked tail to sweet dreams of playing with his favorite people. If you're relaxed, Zion will just hang out. If you want to go out and adventure, Zion is all in! Smart, lovable, and easy on the eyes...what cant he do?\nLike the former Duke favorite and future NBA great, Zion values one thing above all else: family. Zion doesnt like to be left alone, and can become upset if his team isnt around to have his back. Zion would do best in a house where someone in the family works from home or in a family with opposite work schedules. Zion has been responding well to anxiety medication and could also do well in a household where his people can arrange for some afternoon attention or come home for lunch. Because of his separation anxiety, Zion is still working on becoming comfortable spending time in a crate and cannot yet be left alone in a crate. His loud bark would definitely reach the press box in Cameron Indoor Stadium, and he often uses it from his perch at the front window to let you know that your Amazon package has arrived (thanks, Z!). For this reason, he would do best in a stand-alone home with a fenced yard. Zion also moonlights as a counter-surfercowabunga! Because of his fascination with all things small and furry (helloooo, squirrels!), we think that Zion would likely not be the best companion for feline friends, although he has not been cat tested. Hes still young and has a lot to learn, but with some patience and training, Zion will be a Hall-of-Famer for sure.\n Zion was an unclaimed stray at a rural shelter.\n Read more about Zion on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-119/.",

He's a 4 year old hound mix.\n\nRex has been a difficult case. He was referred to us by Gentle Jake's Coonhound Rescue, and surrendered after his owner passed away unexpectedly. Rex was used to guarding his salvage yard property, so he needs patience with new people. Once he is fully settled in with his new people, he is quite friendly and sweet, and loves belly rubs and lying in the sunshine.\nHe is low energy and just wants to keep his people company.\n\nRex would do best in a country property where he has space to be a dog and do his thing. His new owner should be a confident male or couple, with no children, and someone who will commit to continuing Rex's training.\n\nRex will come with 3 mandatory, complimentary, on site training sessions, courtesy of North Grey K9.\n\nIf you think you can handle this guy, or you know someone who sounds like a good match due this cool dude, you can fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91594053676264 and SHARE, SHARE, SHARE to help find this boy his perfect home!\n\nRex has gotten a second chance and we are thrilled to be able to help him. He is also being treated for an ear infection, and will only be adopted after he is clear of it.\n\nLocated near Owen Sound\n\nRex's adoption fee is discounted to $350, which includes:\n- up to date vaccines\n- 1 month flea prevention\n- 3 complimentary training sessions with North Grey K9\n- 6 weeks free pet insurance\n- gift bag of goodies from us\n- bag of food\n\nIf you would like to donate toward Rex's care, please do so by etransfer or PayPal to email rayray1632@gmail.com.\n\nThank you to North Grey K9 and Gentle Jake's for the teamwork in saving this boy!\nHe is a great dog who deserves the best!",

If the dog is 12 weeks old it may have received a rabies vaccination.  All canines are dewormed on intake and at regular intervals.  All parasites are also treated such as fleas and ticks as well.  All dogs 6 months of age and older are tested for heartworm disease and all dogs regardless of age are place on heartworm preventative.  All dogs are microchipped so that if they get lost they can find their way back home to you quickly.  All pets adopted from the center come with a one month free pet insurance which will help to ensure their health and well-being. \nThe animal center does its best to help assure that the adopting person and or family finds a pet suitable and compatable for your lifestyle.  \nPurebred canine adoption fee is $125.  Puppies up to 4 months $125.  Dogs over 4 months $100.  Some of our canine friends have been sponsored by generous patrons- this allows the adoption fee to be reduced from original fee minus sponsorship amount to good homes.",

She doesn't mind spending the night in her crate but she would much rather be curled up beside your bed so she can keep a close and loving eye on you. She is completely house trained and will ask to go out if needed. She is remarkably relaxed and spends her day taking endless naps and basking in the sun but also enjoys a fun game of fetch. We feel Mabel would do best in a home with no other animals or small children. Apply to adopt sweet Mabel today!\n\nI know I may look a little intimidating but my foster mom says I'm the gentlest girl with lots of love and kisses to give! I would be so grateful to find my forever home.I am about 3/4 years old, potty trained, mellow, and loyal. I have been at Wonder Paws for a over a year since they saved me from a high kill shelter hours before they aborted my babies. I have had 1 application but they decided to take home another dog that was younger and more playful. Don't let my laidback personality fool you. I am always up for a good game of tug of war. I am loved & spoiled at my foster mom's home but I can't stop dreaming of a family to call my own. I promise I'll be your best friend forever if you give me a chance. All I ask is for yummy meals, a cozy spot to nap on, and to be the only pup in a quiet home.\n\nTo adopt:\n\nhttps://wonderpaws.wufoo.com/forms/dog-adoption-application/\n\nMabel will come with up to date vaccines, spayed, negative HW & fecal test, free vet visit, and lifetime microchip registration.\n\n2/2/21 11:33 AM",

Now that I'm here, I'm looking for a \"special\" kind of home. My name is Shadow and I'm a 2 year old, female German Shepherd. The reason I need a \"special home\" is that I am very slow to warm up to all people, regardless of age or sex. I do come around eventually and am very treat motivated. I can not live with children or teenagers, as that would be too much activity for me. And I need to be the only animal in the home. Ideally, my new home would be with people who have German Shepherd experience. If you have that \"special something\" and would be willing to be patient and give me a chance, let's spend some time getting to know each other!",

This 40 lb, 1 1/2 year old beauty has the MOST expressive baby Yoda ears you've ever seen. She has a small, dedicated group of friends (mostly lady friends) that she trusts enough to be super goofy with. She loves to play fetch, wrestle with other pups and snuggle with her favorites. She can be a bit wary of new folks, most men and strange situations - so a bit of patience and a lot of treats are an absolute must in winning her over. Once she trusts you, you're BFFs FOREVER!",

This handsome guy is great on a leash, and he loves nothing more than to get out and walk or run with you. Dodger is not a fan of being left home alone while you're out having adventures (or you know, working) so someone with a flexible schedule will be the best match. Dodger needs to be an only dog with a homeowner that is dog experienced. A fenced in yard will be safest for Dodger, and he wouldn't mind possibly living with some older children (6+ years old)\n\nDodger's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations plus a free obedience class at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit. Please submit an application for consideration through our website, www.Adopthope.org",

Well, it turns out that Oliver had actually been adopted from RMG several years ago. Once an RMG dog, always an RMG dog. So a plan was put into motion to get both pups out of animal control and into foster homes because we do not leave family members behind - no matter what. \n \n\nPenelope is only about 2 years old and still quite playful. She gets along great with other dogs and would love to be in a home with other dogs who like to run and play as much as she does. Interested in meeting pretty Penelope? Email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org",

I can jump pretty high, so I need a yard with a tall fence or to be leash walked. I also require a meet and greet with any other dogs in your household before I go home with you.

(November 2020):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lhUjhUqvn1U\n\nBonnie is 24 months old (approx. DOB tba), female, 40 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Bonnie was found as a homeless stray with Clyde; they both are very sweet and very scared of the big world! We found Bonnie and Clyde in person at the shelter in NC huddled in the corner; we knew they stood little chance of making it out of the shelter so we rescued them! Loud noises, barking dogs, etc. scare them so the City life is not a good fit. We felt although they love each other they were best getting away from each other's insecurities and both are now growing everyday with their fosters in Vermont. Bonnie would do well in any loving home with another dog as long as her caretakers understand her boundaries help push her to face her fears. She is a very sweet and gentle pup and very playful. As soon as you grab a toy, Bonnie is ready to play (no coaxing required). Bonnie is crate trained (and likes her crate), does not care to go for car rides yet, potty trained, has medium energy, is doing well on a leash, knows Sit, Come, Laydown, No, and is fearful of strangers. Bonnie enjoy other dog's company and looks to them for leadership. She is willing to share food, treats, toys, couch without aggression or jealously. We guess she would be good with cats too!\nStay tuned for more information as Bonnie is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bonnie please fill out an Application at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue.

            "description": "Howdy there! My name is Maxx and I'm probably the dog for you.\n\n I'm a 5 year old, confident, very active, fun all day long GSD mix. I was pulled from the shelter. Previously, I lived with a family with kids most of my life, but unfortuantely I was allowed to run around too much and that got me into trouble. It seems I really like chasing animals, especially chickens. Yum! \n\nDid you check out my video of me doing some sweet moves on the agility course? That is only half of what I can do! I have a high ball drive and good focus. That means I have great potential as a sport dog or working dog. And on top of that, I love the water! The trainer at EDCGSR said I have great potential, good energy, and I catch on to obedience commands fast! I am crate trained, good on leash, and continue to work on other obedience skills. I am basically the whole package! \n\nMy trainer had me out with other dogs and I did great! Due to my prey drive cats would be a no go for me. But I am great hiking on trails, playing in the lake, I absolutley love to swim, running with my buddies, and carrying my kong and ball with me. My potential family or best buddy should have GSD or working breed experience and be able to work my mind and keep me active. Older children would be best for me.\n\nI'm neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm negative, and microchipped. If I sound like the dog for you, then fill out an application and one of my friends at EDCGSR will contact you!\n\nMinimum adoption donation: $350.00\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Maxx, please copy and paste this link. \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoptions/personal-information?application_type=Adopt&pet_id=747481",

Zuko had a mass removed from his stomach and has healed nicely.  Zuko is 8 years old. He is super sweet and can be really silly. Loves plush toys. Good with other dogs and cats (Will resource-guard if human pack leader does not make him feel safe by keeping other animals a far enough distance away). He eats at least 3 meals a day, and eats very slowly. He\u2019s not a morning person. Prefers to have a light breakfast but makes up for it in the afternoon and evening. When he gets excited his teeth chatter and he smiles. He rarely barks\u2014only when really excited with people and wants attention. He uses the dog door on his own.. He\u2019s getting stronger but still has quite a bit of arthritis pain in his hips and back legs.  Will you be this sweet boys forever home?",

He was adopted once and had severe separation anxiety.\n\nRemy has been to training classes, doggy daycare, playgroups, and has overall been a big love. He has a lot of energy and will need daily exercise (a dog walker coming during the day while you're at work is a major plus). He is super friendly and outgoing and is a total charmer.\n\nHe would love a home with another playful dog to hang out with.

She is used to being the princess, but her dad had to move into assisted living, and Patty also has special needs that was too much for everybody to keep up on, so she came back to us. \n\nShe loves to play and get attention, she has a lot of energy and needs a constructive way to burn it all. Walks and runs are great, and she loves to play fetch in the yard. She demands attention from you if you're not giving her enough, though she does have an off button and loves to have a good cuddle on the couch. She is house trained, knows basic obedience, and is great in the car. She loves people and will crawl right into the lap of strangers!\n\nPatty is an escape artist and needs a home with very tall, very secure fences. No chain link (she can and will climb it). She isn't a fan of other pets and wants to be the only pet. She is special needs - she has an autoimmune disease affecting her GI tract and is on a very strict diet of rx low fat food and digestive enzymes. Her body cannot process fat or protein normally, and without this diet she cannot keep on weight and everything she eats goes right through her.. We are happy to help with the expense of these things as it will be ongoing for the rest of her life. Otherwise she is happy, energetic, and ready for life!\n\nOur volunteers love her because she is sweet, cuddly, playful, and as an attitude that makes everyone laugh. She's crate trained and well behaved, and loves her human friends so much. She's not destructive when left alone, but she is an escape artist and has been a frequent flier at animal control, so keeping her contained is a very high priority. She will steal your heart for sure, all you have to do is give her a chance!",

Mr. T has had 3 trial adoptions.\u00a0 While he went out on his first trail adoption a very sweet, confident, playful dog, he came back with behavioral issues, scared and alpha male dominant.\u00a0 He had two additional trail adoptions, but this sweet pup's behavior had been so altered, sadly, those trail adoptions were not successful. So we are pushing the reset\u00a0button.  He needs a stable forever environment and a confident dog owner who will earn his trust and bond with him allowing him to feel safe.\u00a0 He has been shuffled around too much, thus, the fund raising for training which will be paid directly to the trainer. \nMr. T needs to be the only pet, currently.\u00a0 That could change with training and time, but that is to be determined at a later date, after training and a new bond has been established.\u00a0 He needs a home with room for him to run, a fenced yard and plenty of exercise. Typical dog outings\u00a0like hiking, walks, dog park and so on are good,\u00a0but he will never be suited for anyone who is a runner, due to his knee condition.\u00a0 While stable and doing exceptionally well without any concerns, the constant pounding of running will not be tolerated.\u00a0 If you think you can be a hero for Mr. T, please send an inquiry with a phone number, as our adoption process starts with a phone interview. \nThanks Volunteer Staff LOVE/RESPECT/CONNECT",

            "description": "Please read full description!\n\nBeatty is a Formosan Mountain Dog (Taiwan Dog) - which is the native/indigenous breed of Taiwan. Doing some research on this breed can help you get a better understanding of Beatty, too, though we are happy to answer questions.\n\nFor the most part, Taiwan dogs are rescued as puppies or young adults from the streets (or literally from the side of mountains) and then rehabbed and trained in Taiwan before being transferred to rescues all around the world for adoption. Some people love the breed, some don't - and that's okay! It's important to note that they generally come from long lines of feral dogs, and while they are good with people and dogs, they can be very averse to strangers. They will bark, growl, and sometimes nip, but with patience and training (and slow introductions to new people) they are great. They're generally one-person dogs, and attach themselves to one family member. They are well socialized with dogs and enjoy having canine friends.\n\nBeatty is no exception. He is eccentric, to say the least. He barks like crazy at new people, but once he knows them he's very well behaved and seeks attention. He does nip when frustrated or excited, and while he's never had a major bite, or broken the skin, he needs to be in an adult-only home. Because he can scare strangers (and doesn't like them much anyway) he can be crated in another room while people are over to keep everybody comfortable, or a slow introduction to new people works and he can make friends. He does like other dogs and gets along extremely well with them, although he's not always in the mood to play. \n\nHe has lived with a cat and did okay, so homes with cats can be considered. Beatty can be adopted into an only dog home or into a home with another dog of any size. What he really needs and would thrive with would be a home with adults only without a lot of visitors on a regular basis, who loves to hike, run, walk, and play in the yard. He can always use training, though he is pretty well behaved.\n\nOur volunteers have a lot of fun with him because he is so sassy. He will tell you what he's thinking and then suddenly be sitting like the goodest boy waiting for a toy or a snack. He's a great dog, and a lot of people describe Formosans as being very \"cat-like\" - independent and sometimes aloof, but great dogs nonetheless. If you're looking for a dopey labrador that loves everyone and everything, he's not the right dog for you, but if you're looking for a dog with a funny personality and that would thrive with one-on-one attention or as a companion for your playful, social dog, you're looking in the right place.",

Please read our \u201cINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\u201d section below for guidance. ~\n\n\nMeet Mango! He\u2019s a male Shiba Inu/Jindo mix that\u2019s 3 year old and weighs about 62 pounds. Mango came to us as an owner surrender from a family who loved him, but couldn't give him the structure, boundaries, and rules needed for this unique breed. We often find that love is well-intended, but respect is a two way street between the dog and the human. In order to achieve balance and harmony in the house, space must be respected.\n\nMango has been rehabilitating with our KK9R team in NYC for the past 5 months. He possesses traits of both the Shiba and Jindo breeds: he's loyal, intelligent, happy-go-lucky, quirky, athletic, playful, and affectionate - Mango has it all! He loves being around humans and communicating with his dramatic body language! He also loves being outdoors, doing urban parkour, and running beside us on the bike.\n\nMango can thrive in the right forever home!  He would do best in an adult only household with no other pets. His adopter should provide a structured schedule, lots of exercise, and a respectful partnership with him. Additionally, Mango\u2019s adopter should have previous experience with dogs and be very committed to continued training and rehabilitation.\n\nIf you're looking for a dynamic, charismatic, and bright companion for life, then Mango is the one for you! Apply to adopt Mango! \n\nNote: Mango\u2019s adoption fee is $400.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014---------------------------\n\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\n\nPlease check our Adopt page (www.koreank9rescue.org/adopt) and our Adoption FAQ (www.koreank9rescue.org/adoption-faq) to learn more! These pages include our requirements, adoption fees, adoption procedures, currently adoptable dogs, answers to frequently asked questions, and the link to our online adoption application!\n\n\nNOT READY TO ADOPT BUT LOVE OUR DOGS?\n\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) dog rescue, we rely on donations to continue saving these precious dogs. Check our Donate page (www.koreank9rescue.org/donate) and our Patreon (www.patreon.com/koreank9rescue) to help support our rescue. Let's keep making a difference together!",

            "description": "\"Ace\" arrived at the shelter very scared, trembling with fear. He's had a tough life yet still has so much love to give. Despite what he has lived through and the anxiety he feels, he still smiles and hopes. He has waited many months for an adopter to choose him. Could you be the one? \n\nAce is very high energy and needs an active home with no other dogs, no cats and children should be 14 and older. If you love the outdoors and keeping in shape, Ace is your guy. He would make a great walking/running/hiking buddy. He also enjoys car rides. Ace has boundless energy and playtime is his favorite! There's not a toy he won't fetch and it becomes a game of \"try to catch me\"! Once Ace tires out, he enjoys calming pets and belly rubs.\n\nAce knows his basic commands and is very food motivated. He has been regularly working with a trainer to improve his focus and reactivity to other dogs when out walking. Ace has made great strides and needs a committed adopter to be consistent with him. \n\nAce is 5-1/2 years old, 58 lbs., neutered, current on vaccinations and completely housebroken. He has also exhibited possible separation anxiety. He has started medication to help his overall well-being and his new home should consider consulting with their vet to help Ace be his best self! \n\nAce is not suited to live in an apartment/condo complex as it would be too overwhelming for him. His dream home is in a quiet area with a fenced in yard to run free and play. His ideal family will be committed to showing him what a safe, kind and stable home is. \n\nWe kindly ask, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS regarding Ace, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n*********************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application\n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 59.3lbs Age: 5yrs 7mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

She loves toys too, especially the tug o war kind she can challenge a playmate with.\n\nShiraz is one of 9 puppies we found living under a bridge in Southeast Dallas County.

            "description": "Meet sweet Jada, a 2 year old Mastiff mix who is looking for a special someone to adopt a dog as special as she is. \n\nJada had a bit of a rough start to life. After being taken in by Pet Haven, we realized she had a previously broken leg which had healed incorrectly. The good news is that she had surgery to correct it, and now the bones in her leg are all healed up. She is currently doing at home physical therapy exercises to build up her muscles in her leg, but she is walking and running like a champ. \n\nJada is all about relationships and trust. Once she trusts you, oh my\u2026 she is the sweetest dog in the world. She\u2019ll let you dremel her nails and brush her teeth with ease, is good in the bath and car, and has awesome recall. She loves to cuddle and give kisses. \n\nShe has average to high energy, but tires out quickly. She will be your best friend. That said, she is very weary/fearful of new people (especially men) and new environments. We are working with a trainer to get her more comfortable with meeting new people. She warms up much faster to women than men. We\u2019ll be able to give her adoptive family tips on this process. Because of her uncomfortableness with new people, she\u2019d do best in a quieter home with fewer visitors. We are also recommending a home with dog savvy older children (15+), if any. Jada would also love a consistent routine. \n\nShe is kennel trained, and will happily go in it for a treat. She is crated when we leave the house, and she is very quiet other than when she hears the postal carrier come. She is also potty trained, except for some submissive urination when her owners come home. As long as she\u2019s taken outside right away, then it\u2019s not an issue. \n\nShe loves and lives to play! Tug and chase are her favorite games to play. She also is on the easier side to train. She knows: come, stay, sit, down, shake, go to bed, hand targeting, off, drop and heel. She is getting much better at waiting for permission to go on the couch, and for waiting for permission at the door before going outside or coming inside. She pulls slightly on a leash (we use a head halter), but it\u2019s not bad. \n\nIn the past, she has played with a dog and a puppy and matched their play styles. If there\u2019s another dog in the home, it would be best if the dog was very friendly and didn\u2019t have anxiety. Jada can be fearful and jumpy at times, so it would be nice for her to take cues from a more confident dog. The intro to another dog should be done very slowly in order to ensure success. Otherwise, she would be just fine as the only dog in the house. She has met a cat once, and tried to chase it, so she would probably do best in a house without cats. \n\nBecause of Jada\u2019s fearfulness, she will need a little time to transition to her new home. We are looking for someone to be patient and to give her proper time to adjust and will continue to give her the training she will need in order to be a happy dog. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\nInterested in adopting and/or learning more?

The neighbor called the owners who decided they no longer wanted him since they felt they weren't giving him the home he deserved.  The neighbor had no problem hanging on to him and reached out to the rescue to help find his forever home.  \n\nStriker loves to run and play with his dog friends and also loves to chew on a bone.  His favorite is to be his human's shadow and follow them wherever they go.  He loves going on walks and would be a great dog to take running. \n\nStriker would like a home where he has a 6ft fenced yard as he can jump a shorter fence.  He would do best in a home in a more rural area as loud noises scare him.  He would be an excellent companion for someone active.  \n\nStriker is house trained. He does not do well being confined - whether it be a crate, a room, outside, or the car.  When left, his foster mom leaves him with free roam of the house and he does fine with that.  \n\nStriker is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.

If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm LARK! I'm only about 1.5 years old and 23\" at my withers.  When I arrived I was in heat so I stayed at Casa UPP until I was spayed.  Since then I've enjoyed the hospitality of a number of our favorite daycare/boarding facilities.  I do great everywhere!\n\nI'm very enthusiastic and totally love my people.  I'm getting used to going inside and outside past the cats and don't pay much attention to them. I'm great with other dogs.  I'm might be \"a little much\" for a significantly older dog but really need another well-trained, well-socialized male dog in my new home to show me the ropes and keep me entertained.\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above.

            "description": "Description of pet\n4/22/2020 update - our adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm FORD!  My approximate DOB is 5/15/2019.  I'm a gorgeous, tall boy.  When my rescue lady collected me from the shelter I was so scared that she had to pick me up and carry me into her car.  She tethered me in the back because she knew if she put me in a crate she'd never be able to wedge me out of there!  I promptly tried to wedge myself between the crate & side of the car (about 1.5\") and stayed there for the ride \"home\". \n\nI'm still somewhat afraid of new situations so I need a family who understands this and can introduce me to new experiences slowly and calmly.  I'm very athletic and can go over fences in a heartbeat but I was having so much fun at Casa UPP I never tried it.  There was always so much to entertain me there.  I love being at daycare and am great with the pack at Casa UPP.  There are a lot of other young 'uns about my age to play with.  I'm particularly fond of Lara and Noel.  Lara showed my how much fun the pool is.\n\nI'm OK with the cats.  I'd really like to chase them by Rescue Lady suggested that wasn't a good idea so I'm getting used to them.  I'm OK in my crate but I really prefer being on the bed with the girls.  It seems that I take up a fair amount of acreage so when she wants to go to sleep Rescue Lady frequently returns me to my crate.\n\nFrom my new foster mom:  \"I absolutely love to run around outside, and gallop like a dopey pony. I love to chew on sticks, toys, and bite my foster sister\u2019s ankles when we play. I pretty much go wherever she goes. I definitely need a dog sibling. Going to the dog park is my favorite because I really get to run and meet lots of new friends. I\u2019ve even started introducing myself to people, but I\u2019m still a little timid if they try to pet me. Sleeping on the bed is the best thing, but I still go in my crate if I need. As long as my foster sister is around, I can be trusted out of the crate when my foster family leaves.\n     I'm OK with cats and small dogs! Children intrigue me, and I like to see what they are up to but I keep my distance until I am ready and then I like to run around with them.\n     I\u2019m really a good boy and my foster family tells me I have the sweetest soul, whatever that means.\"\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt east of Colorado.

He wasn\u2019t taken very good care of in his younger days and is now seeking a safe, loving home to live out his golden years.  Fortunately he met a wonderful vet who contacted us to help him.  We have taken good care of him and as you can see from his photos he\u2019s a very cool looking dude!  He does have some lasting effects of his prior life.  We had to remove all of his teeth, but he does just fine with wet food. He is house trained and does his business outside. He will however, occasionally mark inside the house. He\u2019s not very trusting of other dogs and will lunge at them if he feels threatened.  Contrarily he is good with cats!  He has some funny quirks such as he doesn\u2019t like being picked up with your bare hands!  It\u2019s best to use a blanket!  He also has a thing about his face and does not like anyone getting in it!  Grooming is hard as he needs to be sedated. \nSo, if you can find room in your house and heart for this little guy please let us know. He deserves to find a forever family and to know love. \nThank you\n\nBeau's adoption fee is $250 \n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.

            "description": "Two years ago Aubree was set to be euthanized around the holidays. The county shelter was packed, no one was wanting to adopt a scared, un-trusting of humans, black and white pitbull who had a fear of cars, hand touches and leashes. HARTT came across her picture on facebook and immediately stopped and said, we are going to go get her. Fast forward, Aubree grabbed the heart of all the volunteers and even was in a long term foster and was thriving. Sadly her foster had to move over seas and she had to go back into boarding. She was adopted and returned then adopted again by a more experienced owner and unfortunately, Aubree had to be returned because she was acting different. We too noticed something was off, so we evaluated her and noticed she was depressed, not acting like her self. Blood work was done and found out she has hypothyroidism, manageable with medication she takes twice a day and a different simple diet. She is now thriving and doing well, going for walks in the morning, meeting new people and playing with toys again. Aubree would do best in a calm house hold who will help continue to build her confidence and shower her with love. She does take a few times to trust and she is protective over her family so we are looking for a low key calm home who understands her breed and would continue to build her confidence with positive enforcement and treats! SHE LOVES TREATS Aubree is spayed, vaccinated, chipped, and comes with a bunch of new home goodies for her future home. She is sponsored  by one of our volunteers that agreed to pay her adoption fee for whichever home Aubree chooses. Interested in adopting Aubree, contact Destiny@azhartt.org",

He was skinny, dirty and starving, covered in mud and no one was caring for him. After a Good Samaritan reached out to HARTT in hopes we could help get this scared boy, we immediately jumped on the case and safely rescued him. Juno has a long way to come, he is scared but sweet. He loves the companion ship of other dogs just doesn't know how to be a, \"dog\". \nHe isn't ready for walks or a busy house hold but if you have a calm home, calm, social dogs and willing to work with Juno, he would grow so much in a consistent house hold. \nJuno is about 3-4 years old, neutered, vaccinated and chipped. \n\nJuno is currently in our rehabilitation program at our foster home where the foster is continuing working with him and a few of our other project dogs till they find the right family who can continue working with them to build their confidence and be forever home. \n\nIf you are interested in Juno, please reach out to adopt@azhartt.org for more information about Juno and our foster rehabilitation program.",

            "description": "This is a courtesy post for a senior GSD, Rachel, who is looking for a new family.\n\n \n\n\u201cI was born on July 23, 2013. When I was a little puppy I got out and got hit by a car. My owner couldn\u2019t care for me. I was doomed to a kill shelter in Apple Valley, California. But a man named Brian rescued me. He runs the \u201cPuppy Coalition Rescue\u201d in San Marcos, CA. He got my injured hip and leg ?xed via surgery and trained me to be a companion to an elderly woman who recently passed. She left me as part of her estate to her family, but they are not dog people\u2026so they surrendered me to a local trainer to help find me a home.\n\nOn January 8th, 2020 two cool humans, Shayne and Susan, founders of the \u201cGNAW ON THEIR SKULL ACADEMY\u201d (GOTS), ?gured out that I was unhappy, irritable & overweight. I was 102Lbs, and not exercised. I was allergic to the food I was being fed. I was a mess. Not anymore. \u201cLook at Me Now!\u201d I\u2019m a lean 69lbs. I love people, dogs, and kids. I just bark a little\u2026\u201d\n\nThe best fit for Rachel will be a family with GSD experience, and an understanding of her medical needs (Allergies). She is a wonderful companion and can be placed in a home as an only dog, or with other dogs. She also is cat friendly!\n\nIf you are interested in Adopting Rachel or would like more information on her, please contact Shayne at 619.559.0222, or via email at shayneganz@me.com.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

His body was covered in lacerations and his feet were red and sore from the hot pavement. He slept for days before feeling energetic enough to act like a normal dog.\n\nHere are some facts about Appa:\n\u00a0\n-He\u2019s a very sociable dog, loves lots of pets and snuggles, but he isn\u2019t against having some alone time.\n-He\u2019s happy to lounge around the house, and typically appreciates sleeping in. Once he\u2019s up, he can enjoy higher energy activities like jogging or hiking. \n-Whether you are strolling along or running, Appa is okay with sticking to your pace, as long as there\u2019s nothing exciting around, like other dogs, and small animals, which really excite him.\n-Appa is comfortable sharing his food and toys and has never shown aggression towards humans.\n-Appa is gentle about taking treats and knows how to sit before getting his meals.\n-Appa would be a great companion for a variety of high energy, dog-loving homes. Do you think you\u2019d be a good fit for this sweet, affectionate boy? Contact us to meet Appa today!\n",

            "description": "Meet Freckles\nSweet, handsome, roly poly Freckles is just a big love bug who\u2019s led a very scary life before coming to our shelter. We rescued Freckles from a high-kill shelter. He arrived on June 18, 2020. We\u2019re glad he\u2019s here in our safety and care. Freckles was so scared and shut down that in an over-crowded shelter like the one he came from, he could have been one of the first to go down because he was too scared to make human connection\u2026 until he learned he could trust you.\nFreckles is thought to be an American Bulldog mix. He\u2019s two years old and weighs 67 lbs. He\u2019s mostly all white with the cutest brown patches that cover his ears, sort of like he\u2019s wearing a hat. He wears the sweetest expression and his eyes hold a lot of innocence and expectation. He\u2019s absolutely adorable, like a big teddy bear. \nSince arriving, Freckles has been smothered with positive attention and kindness and he\u2019s responding beautifully. Every day he\u2019s learning that not all hands hit and that having a safe place to sleep at night and plenty of food does wonders for the soul. Freckles is learning to trust. Once he knows that you\u2019re not going to hurt him, Freckles loves to give doggie kisses and tail wags. He loves being with people. One of his favorite things to do is sit with his person and be petted.  \nFreckles does best with a gentle approach. Sudden movements, especially over his head, loud barking and fire sirens scare him and he shuts down. He\u2019s not aggressive in any way, but he withdraws and moves away hoping that he won\u2019t get hurt. It\u2019s quite heartbreaking to see him this way, but with quiet encouragement and patient assurance, Freckles will engage when he thinks things are okay. When he does, we\u2019re able to see the big overgrown puppy that Freckles wants to be. \nFreckles walks very well on a leash. He loves his walks. A fenced yard is a must for Freckles. Given his past, if he\u2019s bored or gets frightened, he\u2019ll dig furiously as if he\u2019s trying to get away. What a terrible life this beautiful boy must have led, but we are so happy he\u2019s adjusting every day and is able to let go of the baggage that is his past. We haven\u2019t yet tested Freckles with other dogs, but we do know that he\u2019s terribly afraid of cats and may do best in a home without them.\nFreckles is a wonderful dog. With a kind and patient person, Freckles will blossom under their attention and consistency. Freckles is showing us every day the dog he wants to be - carefree, fun loving, and affectionate. He has so much love and loyalty just waiting to give to his person. He truly just wants to belong to someone who won\u2019t hurt him, but will show him what a loving life can be. Perhaps you\u2019ll be the one to give Freckles his chance at a happy life. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy. 75N, Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n\n",

Sadly that is usually one of the signs of a dog that is going to live a life of breeding. Luckily for him he escaped the life that was being planned out for him and will never be subjected to be used and abused. \n\nBubba Joe is a perfectly sweet gentleman. He loves all the dogs in his foster home and loves to play in the fenced in yard. He has no reaction to any dogs that bark at him or try to be overly dominant. He just wants to be everyone\u2019s best friend. Given his age he would do best in an active home. He would love a family who likes to hike, walk or play in the yard. He would be fine with kids. Cats unknown (he can be cat tested for potential adopters). \n\nBubba Joe is fully vetted- up to date on all shots, neutered and micro-chipped. He is heartworm negative. He is also current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention. He is available for meet and greets. He can also be adopted out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee.",

He is very curious about the cats, but does not chase them and is not mean to them. We've included several pictures of Buster interacting with other dogs. Buster is the apricot colored Chihuahua mix pictured in the first picture. \n\nHowever, Buster recently came from a very bad situation, so he still needs lots of work learning where to potty.\n\nBuster also still needs lots of people socialization, and a home that will understand that it may take him a couple of weeks to warm up to people. Due to coming from a terrible situation, he is very hand shy, as though he expects to be hit, and he does growl and become very bitey when he is scared. Right now, he is particularly scared of having his nails clipped. He's working very hard to be less scared and bitey. Buster needs to find a home with no small children. \n\nBut when he has chosen you to love, Buster can't get close enough to you and will wrap himself around your neck. He likes to be the center of attention, and can get jealous of other animals when he is getting petted.",

Woody was the victim of a terrible hoarding situation where he was housed in filthy conditions with over 30 other dogs. They were lucky if they ever got a meal, and never shown any love. Woody was extremely terrified and did not know what human contact was. This little cutie has come a long way since he arrived at Paw Parent. \n\nWe have been working with Woody, he has came very far but still needs a little more time and love. He now knows what love is and has bonded with one of our crew. He follows her everywhere, and is just happy as can be. Woody is ready for a loving home that would be willing to work with him and pull him out of his shell. This little guy has lots of love to give!\n\nWoody does need a calm environment as he gets scared very easily. He is still very timid, but really wants to bond and be loved. He does need someone who is extremely patient and willing to give him the time he needs. \n\nWoody is neutered, chipped and up to date on all routine vaccinations. If you would like more information on Woody or if you would like to meet him please contact us 661-724-0642 pawparent@gmail.com\n\n",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving adoption applications. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nFreeway will be your best friend once you spend some time with her. She came to the shelter after being found as a stray running alongside a busy freeway. Freeway really loves taking car rides and going on walks/jogs. Her favorite volunteer has been taking her to Wildwood Park on the weekends, and she loves these little adventures. Freeway loves all people but would do best with adults and older children. She can be a bit picky about her canine friends and seems to do best with male dogs. If you think you might be that special person Freeway has been waiting for, please visit warmhearts.org to complete our adoption application. Freeway's estimated DOB is 1/1/2012; she weighs approx 43 lbs.\n\nFreeway was generously sponsored by Renee Shapiro during our virtual Reigning Cats and Dogs event. Thank you Renee for sponsoring Freeway!\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

She has been socialized with people, kids and new experiences/sounds but she has a high interest in other animals, so she would be best as an only dog. She is a happy girl who will greet everyone with a tail wag and wet kisses. she loves snuggling and playing with hardy toys. This gorgeous girl is a medium to high energy and needs someone who will continue her training and socialization to make she stays on the correct path. Ruthy wants a home that loves everything about pittys. \n\nShe will need a plan for longer workdays, so she doesn't spend long days in her crate.\n\nWe hold an event every Sat and Sun from 11am-5pm at 1121 W. Hillcrest Blvd. Inglewood CA, 90301. EACH WEEK is different on how our events will be handled, to know how/ if we are holding an event please CHECK on our WEBSITE and FACEBOOK page every Friday/ Saturday morning. Keep in mind our adoption events take place in an outside venue, with wet weather, high winds, and chilly temperature we would not hold a normal event. We are a Southern California based rescue, we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.

            "description": "Adoption Fee:  $100\nFostered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\nAge: 12.5 years\nWeight: 6.4 lbs.\n\n7/26/20 - Hey everyone.  It\u2019s Milo the Magnificent!  Yep, that\u2019s how I feel now.  No longer in a field having to fend for myself, no longer in a home where they don\u2019t want me, no longer just Milo\u2026 MILO THE MAGNIFICENT!!  I know this sounds as if I know some magic tricks, and I actually do.  You see, I\u2019m blind, but everywhere I go, I adjust very quickly and seem to learn my way around without fail.  I do lightly bump into things, but I\u2019m not timid or scared of my shortcoming which makes me all the more magnificent.  I haven\u2019t been blind all my life, but I will be 13 years old in December, so there were bound to be some body parts that started to give up.  I\u2019m just glad it wasn\u2019t my bladder. Haha.  Yes, a magician AND a comic.  Two dogs for the price of one. \n\nSo, my upkeep, since I have KCS, which is actually a fancy term for dry-eye, I get Optimmune ointment, 1 strip in each eye twice daily.  I also get artificial eye drops in my eyes a couple times a day. \n\nI\u2019m fine with the other fur-beings in the house as long as they don\u2019t get too much up in my business.  Being blind does keep you on higher alert.  I don\u2019t like to sleep in the human bed since I\u2019m afraid I might fall.  I\u2019m very content in a very comfy doggy bed with a blanket.  Foster mom feeds us twice daily.  This is when I do my best magic.  She puts my bowl with soft food down and I empty the bowl.  Not all dogs are this good, I know.\n\nI get along with all people and will LOVE anyone who holds me.  I absolutely LOVE to be held like a baby over your shoulder.  I could stay there all day.  I am pretty free with my kisses too.  I don\u2019t play with toys, but you never know later on.\n\nEven though I cannot see, I\u2019m pretty good with my potty habits if you do your job and take me out often.  Once I get comfortable, I will even get out of my bed and bark and when foster mom brings me out, I tinkle. \n\nI like to walk around outside, but not sure if a fenced in yard is totally necessary if you are sure you stay out with me the whole time.  Then again, who would put a dog out and let it stay out alone to use the bathroom with all the hawks and wild animals around.  That\u2019s not the type owner I want next.  Not sure that apartment or condo life would be for me since I do have a bark and am not afraid to use it.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say about myself for now.  If you would like to help me take this magician act on the road, just fill out an application and my new employees will see if you can cut the mustard.\n\nSigning off for now.  POOF!\n\n7/2/20 - Milo had his dental yesterday.  He lost 7 teeth that were just aching to come out.  His tummy was a little upset last night and he wasn't feeling all that great, but today is a new day.  And, it is the first day of the rest of his great life.  Rotten teeth and bacteria free now, and still eating like a champ.  Milo eats soft food and cleans his plate.  For his eyes, he gets Optimmune ointment, 1 strip in each eye twice daily to help with the KCS/dry eyes.  He also gets Neopolydex, 1 drop in each eye twice daily for inflammation and the infection in his eyes.  We will be following up with the ophthalmologist later to get the long-term regime for this sweeties little eyes.\n\nBeing blind is not something that holds Milo back.  Some dogs just adjust well, and he is one of them.  We think Milo was an agility dog in his previous life.  How else could you explain the way he just flies over all the hurdles that have been put in his path?  Well, that and he must have angels riding on his back.  \n\n6/25/20 - Milo is 13 years old, blind and was found lost in a field near Arlington, TX and turned into Mansfield Shelter.  Milo had a chip and his owners were contacted.  They informed that he had gone missing a few months back and they could not find him.  The owner had since gotten a new job and was working long hours and said that getting Milo back would not be in Milo\u2019s best interest, so agreed to surrender him to Yorkie Haven Rescue since the shelter had already reached out us.  He was pulled from the shelter Monday, June 22nd and transported to a layover home in Shreveport.  We brought him to the vet since his eyes were very infected.  He has very mature cataracts and had bilateral conjunctivitis with mucoid discharge.  He also has KCS (dry eye) so will be on medicated ointment from now on.  Saturday, June 27th, Milo will complete his transport to his foster home in Baton Rouge.  Once he is comfortable, we will get him to the vet to get blood work done, along with a much needed dental and we are sure he will lose infected teeth.  Even with his rough journey lately, being blind and changing multiple hands, and not know what was going on and who to trust, Milo has been a champ through it all.  He does love to be attended to and talked to.\n\nThe bad pictures are of Milo when he was first brought to the shelter after being on his own.  The cuter one is, of course, after the shelter trimmed and bathed him.  Once we get him in his permanent foster home, he will get to visit the professional groomer and photographer and we will show you just what a handsome boy Milo can be.  Basically, all dogs ask for in life is food, grooming, vetting and love.  We don\u2019t feel this is too much to ask for from a companion that never asked to be brought into this world but was purchased as a young pup to give a human.  Then, WHAM, when they need us the most, \u2026\u2026.. the humans cannot give that in return.  That is where rescue comes in.  Seems we can pick forever homes MUCH BETTER than the breeders who sell them in the beginning.  Harsh, I think not!  Proven!\n\nMilo will be letting you know more about his personality, needs and wants as we get to know him better.  Stay tuned!",

            "description": "Branton is a 2 year old border collie. He is such a handsome boy! Branton has lived most of his life with dogs and is now learning to trust people. He is very skittish and his current safe place is his crate. Because of this, potential adopters will have multiple meet and greets in order for us to identify his ideal home. Branton cannot walk on a leash and because of his fear of people, is considered a flight risk. His ideal family would offer a home with a fenced yard and a family that is willing to spend many hours working on building his trust. Stability and a routine are critical. Branton will allow you to touch him, pet him, and love on him.... It's truly going to be a labor of love. We are working with this precious boy and look forward to seeing his happily ever after fairytale ending! If you are interested in learning more about Branton, please apply to\nangelsrescue.org\n.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

            "description": "Brent came from a hoarding case in Suwannee County. Due to poor living conditions and neglect, Brent suffered from a skin condition known as demodex mange. His fur has since grown back, and he's been learning to live and breathe easy. As a remnant of the abuse he can be standoffish and distrusting at first, but once he gets to know you, a funny and loving dog emerges. He takes longer to get used to men than women and will need patience and persistence to build your trust. He thinks he is a lap dog and will do all he can to get your attention. While humans sometimes scare him, he has lived with dogs of all sizes from 15 to 95 lbs and is quick to instigate play time! He'll do great in a home with an energetic and playful dog that is ideally his size or larger. He is very energetic and loves playing with other dogs! Brent has been working with a trainer to get used to meeting new people in public. He has made a lot of progress, but will need plenty more positive experiences and interactions to be completely comfortable. He is very food oriented without getting defensive, which has made for great encouragement in his progress. Because he is so food motivated, he is highly trainable. Brent is very smart and knows how to sit, lay down, and shake on command. Brent loves his crate, is housebroken, and is very confident on leash. If you are up for an extremely rewarding challenge, Brent is the dog for you. \nRequirements: Fenced backyard, no kids, no cats, another active dog in the home.\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip. Dog/puppy adoption fees range from $150-$400. Cat/kitten adoption fees range from $50-$150.",

Ranger is fully vaccinated, neutered, has microchip and heartworm negative. Please contact Ranger's foster family to meet him and get adoption info: Lori 404-376-3776. Looking for love at first sight? You found him! Meet your new best friend! Ranger will love you unconditionally, provide constant companionship and LOTS of snuggling. Ranger LOVES people and is eager to meet everyone, bounding up with a big smile, begging to be pet. Then he'll happily melt at your feet. Ranger is energetic, dog-friendly and likes playing, chasing and clowning around with other dogs in the yard, as well as cuddling up and napping with them. Ranger would enjoy a multi dog family with a fenced yard to play and sunbathe. But, as YOUR best friend, Ranger prefers to spend most of his time by your side throughout the day, as you cook, clean, or binge TV on the couch. Ranger is an attentive listener, intuitive to your feelings, caring, and offers empathetic snuggles. Ranger is an adult (4 yo+) neutered male pit bull terrier mix, 60 lbs, brown with white neck, feet and snout. Ranger was found as a stray in awful condition suffering from separation anxiety and skin allergies; but he is SO resilient! Strong, healthy, velvety soft and full of love! Ranger is ready for his new best friend to bring him home where he will feel safe and loved at last. Please contact Ranger's foster family to meet him and get adoption info: Lori 404-376-3776",

For more information and the adoption application for Scully, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22292&name=ScullyScully is a laid back, easy going guy who would love to have a best friend with whom to spend his retirement years. He's an active senior, around 9 years old, who absolutely adores going for walks and doesn't need any assistance, thank you very much. He is happy to walk for over a mile and then will celebrate by taking a nap when he gets home. He's a napping professional and can often be found on his back, looking like he fell asleep mid-rollover. While Scully gets along with everyone, he doesn't like to be touched when he doesn't see it coming. Because of this, we think a home with no children would be best. He's in a foster home with two young adults and he has proven to be a great house guest who is potty trained, good in the house, and easy on a leash.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

He is healthy, neutered, and current on all vaccines. He was adopted at a year old and has been living with a loving family for two years that had another dog. They were doing great together until recently, which is why we need to find Stitch another loving home.\n\nHe's a happy, loving dog and is crate trained. Stitch loves walks and playing fetch. Stitch is very puppy-like and he loves toys and you may even need to keep your socks off the floor as Stitch thinks those are toys.\n\nHe can get over-excited when playing with small children with high energy, so maybe kids a little older would be best. He may need to be the only dog in the family. If you'd like to meet Stitch, please submit a completed\nadoption application found\nat www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. He is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short and/or long term doggie foster families. We greatly appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and safety of a home and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if needed), etc. If you are interested please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

Link wants to be your only dog, as he can be pretty reactive to other dogs and would love all the attention. People also need to go slow with him and once he knows and trusts you, he's GREAT! He'd flourish in a quiet home without a lot of people/visitors coming and going since he can be people-selective. Because he's so playful and has a cute energetic personality, he'll need a yard with a block wall, so no apartments please. Link is about 1 1/2 years old, neutered, current on shots, microchipped, and his adoption would include an in-home training session. Still waiting on DNA tests to see what he is made up of--he's SO cute!\n\nIf interested in meeting Link text 480-359-7109\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

He loves going for walks and playing with tug-of-war toys. Tank is not a huge fan of other dogs. \n\nTank was a happy boy while he had his outdoor photos taken, and  he adored HSOV kennel tech Madison Barnett who helped him with his 'passport pictures'.  Tank is full of energy and seems much younger than the chronological age listed on his kennel card. This guy is truly \u2018young at heart\u2019 \n\nTank weighs approximately 50 lbs and walks fairly well on a leash.   \n\nTank has already been neutered, so he could leave the shelter fairly quickly with an approved HSOV adoption application.\n",

Chance, a 7yr old male American bull dog with an adorable black patch over his eye. Chance is very, very smart.  He\u2019s been through 5 weeks of boot camp and knows so many commands.  His trainer says he\u2019s a thinker, a planner.  (In a good way, of course) Allie, well, she\u2019s a goofy lizard master. She hunts for lizards all day and follows Chase around, copying everything he does.  The two absolutely love each other to pieces.  Chance and Allie can be a little picky with who they like so these two should be the only dogs in the family??. However, when on leash, Chance is trained to \u201cleave it\u201d and will walk right by all other dogs, walking with a loose leash, of course.  Allie just follows Chances lead.  Chance is such a lover and Allie so silly.  Both utd on vaccines, spayed, neutered, and microchipped.  These two were rescued from deplorable conditions from Long Beach, Ca. and have been waiting for their forever home for 7 months.  We don\u2019t know why, they\u2019re such special dogs. ??.

Chance is very, very smart.  He\u2019s been through 5 weeks of boot camp and knows so many commands.  His trainer says he\u2019s a thinker, a planner.  (In a good way, of course) Allie, well, she\u2019s a goofy lizard master.  She hunts for lizards all day and follows Chase around, copying everything he does.  The two absolutely love each other to pieces.  Chance and Allie can be a little picky with who they like so these two should be the only dogs in the family??. However, when on leash, Chance is trained to \u201cleave it\u201d and will walk right by all other dogs, walking with a loose leash, of course.  Allie just follows Chances lead.  Chance is such a lover and Allie so silly.  Both utd on vaccines, spayed, neutered, and microchipped.  These two were rescued from deplorable conditions from Long Beach, Ca. and have been waiting for their forever home for 7 months.  We don\u2019t know why, they\u2019re such special dogs. ??.

Once settled, he enjoys being outside, going for walks, and using his nose. He requires a fenced yard where he can roam, sniff and lounge. He is not super high energy but will require 1-2 walks a day and time outside in a fenced area. \n\nHank can be reactive with other dogs on leash, mainly due to his anxiety but has been fine with dogs that are calm and laid back out and about. Hank would like to be the only dog living in the home. Hank CANNOT be with cats. He could be older with kids over 8 that are respectful. \n\nHank is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered.

She loves all people and is great with little children.  She has never been in a home and when we brought her in ours she wets the floor often due to nervousness.  Jewel does well with some dogs but sadly took an instant dislike to one of our small dogs and cannot be around him at all. She has met a larger dog and done OK, so she may be fine with a larger dog who lets her have her space. We do not have cats or other small animals so I do not know how she would react with these.  She is a sweet old girl who just needs to find her forever home and a soft place to land. \n\nShe is spayed and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $75.

            "description": "Sammy is a precious approx 9 mos old black mouth cur mix.  He is the cutest lil fella.  He is great with kids and other dogs. Happy-go-lucky description es this sweet boy!    He is playful, funny and is so cute to watch.  He is smart but clumsy as he is still very much a puppy and hasn\u2019t grown into his legs yet. He loves to run and play with others.  He adores treats and head rubs!  He does great on a leash and is working on sit/stay command.  He needs his very own fur-ever family to grow up with.  Won\u2019t you make him a part of yours?       \n\nHe is heart worm negative. \nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup tested heartworm negative, and is on regular monthly heartworm prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nFYI:   Even though this pup tested heartworm negative, we provide the following procedural information for your information:  Any of our pups who test HW+ are treated with the *slow kill method of treatment.   The *slow-kill method, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.",

Her only safety net appears to have been her siblings so she is completely dependent on being in a home with a dog friend. As far as people go, once see trusts you she is your shadow and loves massages. She loves going for walks and just being outside. Fast movements make her nervous so small children aren't an option. If you have a quiet household, are a patient person, a visible fence and another medium sized dog that loves to play she is your dog.\n\n You can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/ \n\nAdoption fee: $475.00 Adoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit.

My foster dad lets me soak up the sun in our back yard and it's my favorite activity, besides playing with all my dog friends! I am the queen of zoomies and some say I hop around instead of run. I am very silly and love to show that by play bowing in front of you to get you to chase me or throw a toy for me. Cuddling in the recliner with my foster dad is the best, I like to be right next to him! I have been around cats and don't really pay them much attention, it's dogs I'm really interested in. In my forever home I'd love to have another dog to give me confidence and to keep me company when my human parents are busy. I'll show you how happy I am by smiling and wagging my tail, my smile is infectious! I can't wait to meet my forever family!\n\nAll of our pets start their journey in Memphis Tennessee where they remain in loving foster families until they are adopted.\n\nIn order to qualify for ALIVE Rescue Memphis's program all of the following steps must be met:\n\n\u2022 You must be at least 21 years of age and be able to provide ALIVE with proof of age.\n\n\u2022 Any current pets must be up to date on vaccinations, and be spayed/neutered. Exceptions to this will only be considered if proof of a medical explanation is provided.\n\n\u2022 If you currently rent, you must provide a landlord\u2019s phone number and a copy of your executed lease.\n\n\u2022 All members of the family living in the home where the animal will be placed must be interviewed.\n\n\u2022 Applicant must live within 50 miles of Memphis if interested in adopting and within 30 miles of Memphis if interested in fostering. \n\n\u2022Allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to insure that your home is safe for the potential new dog or cat.\n\n\u2022You must allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to ensure that your home is safe for the potential new pet.\n\n\u2022You must be able and willing to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment, and proper care for a pet.\n\n\u2022Currently, adoptions fees in Memphis are $275 for a dog over 4 months of age, $300 for a dog under 4 months of age.\n\n\u2022We require an additional $75 training deposit at the time of adoption. You will be required to enroll and complete a training class with your new companion at one of our approved training facilities. Once ALIVE Rescue Memphis receives proof of the completed class, this $75 deposit will be refunded.\n\n\nOur adoption application can be found at http://www.aliverescuememphis.org/memphis-nashville-adoptions\n\nDue to the extremely high volume of inquiries we receive, we ask that you submit an application immediately to start the adoption process. We try very hard to include all pertinent information in our bios. We are excited to help you find your new family member. However, ALIVE Rescue Memphis is operated 100% by volunteers. We want to spend our time saving dogs and assisting those adopters who have taken the time to complete an application. Thank you for understanding.\n\nBreed selection is done in conjunction with two local vets and is not to be considered a guarantee but rather a well-educated decision from well qualified staff.\n\nLIKE ALIVE Rescue Memphis on Facebook & Instagram!\nThanks for choosing rescue!!",

We don\u2019t know his past, but he is very slow to trust and needs an extremely patient and calm home. Blake doesn\u2019t like to be picked up and likes to be handled only on his terms. We know the perfect patient home is out there, just waiting for his big smile to brighten their life!\nBlake\u2019s ideal home would have no children and no other animals, he wants all the attention to himself!\n\t\n*We are closed to the public for viewing. Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting Blake.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

Sasha would do great with an older dog sibling to learn from. She is still a pup and wants her new family to know that she will require training but will reward your patience with lots of snuggles! Sasha has spent the first few months of her life in busy environments and as a result displays some resource guarding behaviors and can take a little while to warm up to strangers, especially men. Like most of us these days, Sasha is not a fan of baths or manicures...but she is a fan of hot dogs, liver treats and belly rubs :) Sasha is looking for a fenced-in yard where she can get her puppy energy out and a patient family that has the time to dedicate to her training. Sasha is a very sweet and loving girl. With the proper training that she missed out on as a younger pup, she will be a great addition to the family!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

In the year he's been with us, Barry also suffered seizures and kidney stones. He's on a special diet and medication for all of these things, but he's still a grump. And we all still love him! \n\nSince being in our care, the poor guy has had to deal with puppies and big dogs who dont understand why he doesn't want to roughhouse. He does get along with dogs who aren't in his face and likes to fetch a ball as long as you don't try to take it back from him (Barry's rules).\n\nOrnery as he is, Barry is kind of our mascot and we want the old guy to catch a break and live out the remainder of his life with someone he can find solace in. \n\nBarry loves to rub his back on the floor and wiggle and loves to have belly rubs by a person of his choosing. He enjoys certain members of our team while others simply arent his cup of tea.\n\nTo find out more about Barry, meet him and see if he's a match for you, text or call Julie at 435-773-5209.",

I'm spayed and have had all my shots. These days I'm perfectly healthy! I get along great with kids and other dogs. My foster mom has a 11 year old and I'm great with him! (Unfortunately my foster mom doesn't have any friends with really little kids so we're not sure how I'll do with them).\n\nMy 2 favorite things in the world are snuggling and chew toys. I would do best in a home with an experienced dog owner because my foster mom says I still need quite a bit of training. I'm extremely smart, I just need a family with the time, knowledge and patience to help me get the hang of things. I'm really just hoping to find a loving family to call mine forever. I love snuggling, chewing on tennis balls and really just need a couple long walks a day and lots of love to be happy.\n\nSadie's Adoption fee is $200\n\nPlease email Kelly.V@HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com and fill out the application on our website HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nwww.heidislegacydogrescue.com/apply-to-foster-or-adopt",

We rescued an entire family of beagles including June's mother. They were living in horrible conditions, and all four of the adult beagles had heart worm disease. June was a wonderful puppy, and was very loving and happy.  Her family reached out to me for help when June started resource guarding. They loved her very much and she was part of their family. Unfortunately, they have 2 children under the age of five and there were a few incidents with June growling at the kids if they woke her up suddenly. They just couldn't take any chances, So here we are, June aka Sunny is back with Gimme Shelter, and we're looking for her perfect match. I would prefer a family that is experienced with Beagles and understands resource guarding behavior. She has been through obedience training and is a very smart dog. Sunny would do best with someone that will keep her busy with activities, and obviously no small children.",

            "description": "While he may have the good looks of James Dean, this rebel has a cause - to be adopted! A two year old pitbull mix, Rebel was surrendered to our shelter when his owner was no longer able to care for him. A BIG boy, Rebel needs an owner who can not only handle his size but his energy. Though sweet and affectionate, he lacks basic manners and is more puppy than adult. While our staff has been working with him on leash manners and commands, he will need continued training once placed in a home. Due to his size and energy, Rebel should be placed with older children and in a home without cats. He is slowly starting to make canine friends at the shelter and would benefit from another dog his size to play with - he already has an admirer in Ella, who is notoriously picky about her friends! If interested in Rebel, email Vicki at Vicki@nokillarc.org",

She  can  keep  him temporarily.   \n\nWade is about 5 years old.  He  would  be a  fit  as  the only  dog or a  submissive  female  dog. He does not do well with children or men.  We are  not sure about  cats.  Because he has  so  much  energy, he will  do  best in  an  adults only  home.    \n\nHe is  over  the puppy  phase but  will  need regular  exercise,  and is  used to  living in a  home. \n\nHe  is  up  to  date on vet care and  is neutered. \n\nWade is  housebroken,  crate  trained, and walks  on  leash.  \n\nTo  meet  Wade, contact  kmccurryok@yahoo.com. \n\n",

            "description": "Sugar Magnolia and Mr. Bojangles are a bonded pair of jack russell/ beagle mixes. Sugar Magnolia is a 2 to 3 year old female who weighs 18lbs. She arrived pregnant with her companion Mr. Bojangles, a 22 lb male, who is 1 to 2 years old. Unfortunately these 2 obviously suffered from  mistreatment and neglect in the past. They are a little fearful of new people .  They are housebroken but are trained to a dog door with a fenced yard.  These two must have a secure fenced yard that is attached to the house and one they cannot dig out of. An electric fence, kennel or run are absolutely not an option.  They have been around respectful children and have done fine; however, because they are fearful and are a flight risk if they get out of the fence, a quiet adult only home or one with respectful, older children is preferred. They are both good with dogs and cats but a prior situation with one of the cats they currently live with would  necessitate that they go to a home without cats or one where the cats can be kept separate when no one is home. They do get on furniture now, so if you don't allow dogs on furniture; these are not the dogs for you. These guys will require an experienced and patient home ( no first time dog owners). They cannot live in a city or suburban  environment  but rather require a quiet, rural area and a house (no apartments and you must own your home).  They are affectionate and playful dogs once they trust you. Mr. Bojangles is on a joint supplement due to a slightly abnormal gait in his right hind. If you are interested in adopting these two and meet all their requirements, go to www.journeyanimalrescue.org to submit an application. Only once an application is completely approved (including a vet check and home check) will a meet and greet be scheduled.  This requires all human and canine family members come to Fryeburg, Maine to meet them. Adoption fee for the pair is 700.",

            "description": "Sugar Magnolia and Mr. Bojangles are a bonded pair of jack russell/ beagle mixes. Sugar Magnolia is a 2 to 3 year old female who weighs 17 lbs. She arrived pregnant with her companion Mr. Bojangles, a 17 lb male, who is 1 to 2 years old. Unfortunately these 2 obviously suffered from  mistreatment and neglect in the past and are fearful of new people and still have insecurities in their foster home after several months.  They are housebroken but are trained to a dog door with a fenced yard.  These two must have a secure fenced yard that is attached to the house and one they cannot dig out of. An electric fence, kennel or run are absolutely not an option.  They have been around respectful children and have done fine; however, because they are fearful and are a flight risk if they get out of the fence, a quiet adult only home or one with respectful, older chikdren is preferred. A home with young children under the age of 8 is not an option due to the level of activity and noise that ensues. They are both good with dogs and cats but a prior situation with one of the cats they currently live with would  necessitate that they go to a home without cats or one where the cats can be kept separate when no one is home. They do get on furniture now, so if you don't allow dogs on furniture; these are not the dogs for you. These guys will require an experienced and patient home ( no first time dog owners). They cannot live in a city or suburban  environment  but rather require a quiet, rural area and a house (no apartments and you must own your home).  They are affectionate and playful dogs once they trust you but do have fear issues. Mr. Bojangles is on a joint supplement due to a slightly abnormal gait in his right hind. If you are interested in adopting these two and meet all their requirements, go to www.journeyanimalrescue.org to submit an application. Only once an application is completely approved (including a vet check and home check) will a meet and greet be scheduled.  This requires all human and canine family members come to Fryeburg, Maine to meet them. Adoption fee for the pair is 700.",

His coat is shiny, his eyes are bright! His foster family reports he loves to play and have a blast. Open the car door and he will hop right in, ready for his next adventure. He has a constant doggy smile on his face now that he knows he is safe and secure.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

She had a tough past but we are helping her to focus forward. She loves big and plush dog beds, as many stuffed toys that she can get her paws on, and silly talk that gets her hopping around with glee. Indigo would be best in a home without cats, dogs, or children. She has plenty of love to give the right person. Please schedule an appointment with the Behavior Team to learn more about her.",

Starved almost to death, we were not sure if she would make it, but our girl is a fighter.  Since she was found abandoned, emaciated, and very sick, she has had two growths removed, heart worm treatment and is diabetic.   More than likely due to her diabetes, she has lost her vision.    \nShe has been through it, but is still a happy girl, who loves to snuggle but still likes to go walking and play a bit.    She needs a special person who does not mind giving her insulin twice a day ( vetsulin), taking her on a walk or two and letting her snuggle with you when she naps.\nIf Zelda is a perfect addition to your family, please  let us know.\n\n\nThe on line application for her adoption is below. Please note, we do the following\n1. on line application\n2. vet and reference check\n3. phone call\n4. home visit\n5 meet and greet\n6. adoption\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again. No more hurt or fear.\n\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/",

            "description": "Daffadil is in foster \n She wins the hearts of everyone she meets. Daffo is a 5 year old Pit Bull mix that loves to be the center of attention. This Angel is very easy to fall in love with. She didn't do well in the shelter environment, but is thriving in her foster home. She has not had any potty accidents, only barked a few times, and likes having a daily routine. Her foster Dad says she is a very easy dog to take care of. Daffo has to be on a strict hypoallergenic diet and is also on Apoquel daily for allergies. She loves to run in her fenced yard and play with KONG squeaky balls she looks like a bucking pony when she chases the balls and going on car rides. When in the home she likes to snuggle and is fine left out on her own when her foster Dad is at work. She also likes to wear sweaters, sweatshirts, or T-shirts. You need to be over 21, a homeowner, and commit to keeping her on her hypoallergenic diet and meds. Apply at:\nTapsshelter.org\n\nDaffadil is an insecure dog that needs a quiet, only pet environment. When things are quiet and calm, she can peacefully co-exist with another dog, but she is easily startled by loud noises such as fireworks, and becomes over-stimulated by both noises and active dog play and becomes dog aggressive. Daffadil also has many allergies and requires a prescription allergen-free diet, which isn't much more costly than a normal quality food diet. Your vet can give you a prescription and you can order directly from Chewy or another mail order company right to your door. She also requires a monthly medical prescription that can be between $75-$100/month. We are also suggesting a home without children under the age of 12 due to loud noises/fast movements making her uncomfortable. \n\nShe is a special girl that is looking for a quiet home where she can be the queen.",

The kids were heartbroken and even wrote Charlie a goodbye letter that tugs our heartstrings.\n\nCharlie was nervous when his owners left him for the first time at our vet. We soon learned that he is deaf and could not hear our assurances. His owners never mentioned this to us. Charlie received his updated vaccines and he was able to get neutered and microchipped. \n\nCharlie went into a temporary foster home, and he did well adjusting to an entirely different lifestyle. Since he is deaf, we put Charlie through professional training to work on physical and visual commands and affirmations that are usually given verbally. He has been doing really well with his training! The trainers will teach adopters how to work with him, and teach adopters what Charlie has learned. We are looking for a home that can help guide him along in life since he is already at a disadvantage. He does need a proper introduction with new people, and we would not recommend a home with a lot of foot traffic (meaning you would need Charlie to meet a bunch of new people). He is a total sweetheart with people he is comfortable with and he is just looking for a new constant. Charlie loves to play with toys, and he would like to go for walks (he does GREAT on a leash with his new training) or play in the yard. He LOVES cuddle time. That is a must.\n\nCharlie is about 2 years old and weighs 80 lbs. He is neutered, micorchipped, up to date on vaccinations, and heartworm negative.\n\nEmail us at info@adorehouston.org with questions about Charlie. If you would like to apply to adopt him, the link is www.adorehouston.org/adoption-application/",

We have no idea how they got there but do feel they were dumped. They would not have been able to get in that situation by themselves. We believe they are related.....either father/daughter or siblings. They were very skinny when found.\n\nAdam is doing great now. Sadly, he tested positive for heartworm but has been treated. He does have severe vision impairment. He seems to sense things better in the distance but is unable to see things up close. That doesn\u2019t stop him though. He adapts quickly to a new situation and relies heavily on his sense of hearing and smell to familiarize himself to his surroundings. He loves to play with other dogs. He does best with bigger dogs. He does not do well with cats. Adam must have a fenced yard. He does best with a controlled, predictable environment. He loves people and attention but does need a slow, calm introduction to let him adjust to a new voice and new smells.\n\nAdam is neutered, HW negative and up to date on shots.

Savannah came to us in September 2019 with a bullet lodged in her spine and a fiery, rowdy, and feisty spirit. Over the last year, she has undergone surgery and a long recovery to remove the bullet, she\u2019s done countless hours of acupuncture, aqua treadmill, and laser therapies, and she was neglected and uncared for by a previous foster causing major setbacks\u2026 Although the bullet did permanent damage and she will not walk unaided on her own, all of the various therapies she has been through over the last year have increased her mobility, increased her energy, made her stronger overall.\n\nSavannah's ideal home is one with no men, no children, and no other pets. Savannah will thrive best in a home as an only dog in an active household. She is a young dog and she loves to play and be outside and run. She is paralyzed in her back end due to being shot in the spine, and she uses a cart for play and exercise time. She does require bladder expression (manually squeezing urine from the bladder) which is quick, clean, and easy to do.\n\nWe need a hero to open their heart and home to this special girl\n\n***\nLoveyLoaves is a specially-abled dog rescue based in Orlando, FL. We work to rehabilitate and rehome dogs who have special needs and have been dealt different circumstances in life. The LoveyLoaves adoption application is available at www.LoveyLoaves.org. Prior to being turned over to their forever families, LoveyLoaves requires an adoption fee per dog to cover vetting including neuter, microchip, and vaccinations. Medical records will be transferred to the new pet guardian upon adoption. If you have questions about this dog or about the LoveyLoaves adoption process please feel free to contact us at (407) 446-2245 or at cheri@loveyloaves.org.",

He was found in a pen, tethered and couldn't reach food or water. Victor was stuck outside, starving to death. He was so thin, a woman's bracelet could've fit around him. At 5 years old, this poor guy had a body score of 0.75, weighing in at a scant 21 pounds when he should've been at least 50 pounds. Of course, Victor was also heartworm positive. While most rescues were shutting down intakes due to COVID-19, we kept going and Victor got his freedom ride on April 21, 2020.\nABOUT VICTOR\nVictor has put on weight and is a happy, healthy boy. He is a quiet, sweet boy who is housebroken and crate-trained. He underwent heartworm treatment in August 2020 and he will be neutered a few weeks later and ready to go into an adoptive home. We estimate this to be sometime in September 2020.\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

On his last recheck he is healing great with cage rest. He can walk well but still needs more cage rest. He would love a home where he could finish his recovery in a nice, quiet environment with older kids only. Larry is a hound mix, about 2 1/2 years old and weighs\n\n45 pounds. He is very shy (not surprising with what he's been through) but oh so very sweet once he knows you. Larry is heartworm positive which is treatable. Can you help this sweet boy? He will love you faithfully forever in return. Adoption fee $60 which covers shots and neuter. Come and meet him at the Livingston Parish Animal Shelter or call 225-686-7798 for more info.\n12/10/20 11:27 AM",

She does see shadows.\n\nRain is 13 weeks old now, and is ready for her forever home.\nAs you can see, she loves to play, and would do best in a home with another dog that would like to play with her. Children who would like to play with her would be fine as well :-)\n\nShe loves a kiddy pool, running in the yard, and her toys.  She thinks car rides are the best!\n\nShe has a very comfortable bed  in her foster home and comes with her harness, matching leash and some toys.\n\nRain is spayed, and up-to-date on vaccinations. \nSomeone who has experience with deaf/blind dogs would be great. Keep in mind that you cannot call her, she doesn\u2019t listen to commands, because she can\u2019t hear you :-)\n\nLet us know if you\u2019d like to meet this baby!\n\nThis pup can be adopted by going to our web site www.homesforpets.org and filling out one of our applications.",

I am a little on the smaller side for a Weim, but what I lack in size, I make up for in personality. I can be a little pushy and bossy with other dogs so I need a dog in my home that will keep me in line a bit but not be overly alpha or aggressive. I am a lover not a fighter but my Foster Mom says that I can be like an annoying little \"gnat\" around other dogs as I do not always understand doggie spatial boundaries. I do like to play though and would enjoy another canine companion to hang out with. Mom says I need a canine sibling that can teach me some better dog-dog manners!I am submissive to my people and really want to please and am more comfortable following a confident \"hoo-man\" who is the leader of the pack! I was surrendered to GLWR because I was too worried about protecting my people and they did not have the environment or the skills to help me learn how to respond when meeting new folks. I just didn't understand my role in my home. My foster Mom says I have really come a long way and with the right home, patience, training, love, and snuggles I can finally let my guard down and be my true Weimaraner self! If you want a fun loving, snuggle bug little fella that wants to be your best bud than I am the guy for you. Mom says that I am extra special so my family needs to be extra special too!",

We removed some of the tumors and treating her for her heartworm, but we are doing everything with her in mind of making her comfortable and happy right now. The cancer is throughout her, so there is not much the vets can do. We have her on medication and she has gained weight and is loved by her foster mom until she passes. She follows her foster mom all around and is just such a loving and sweet soul. We want to spoil her until the end.

Sawyer was neglected for years before arriving in a shelter. He also had a sister that we tried to save but sadly she was very sick and the Vets said the humane thing to do was to end her suffering. It was one of the hardest decisions. it's a horrible thing to try to save a dog and in the end fail them. Sawyer's heart is very enlarged, he is at the end stages of heart failure due to heart-worm for way too long. He is on a few heart medication until he passes and on a slow kill heart-worm treatment, but sadly we don't know how much longer his heart will last. He does have some bad days, but his good days are awesome days because of Sarah. He is spoiled and loved until the time comes. These dogs do not deserve the hands that they were dealt, but we can all help them by being strong and taking them into our heart and homes. So, we want to thank Sarah Simpson for giving him his best life, and Anyone who contributed to him. It's a very selfless act and needs to be commended, as not many of us can do it, but each dog deserves it.",

He is very smart and already knows sit, stay and paw, and he loves to play fetch! Justin prefers to be the *only* animal in the household, and due to his size and energy level, we feel it would be best for him to be in a household with children no younger than teenagers. He is a jumper, so a fenced in yard is a must.\n\nJustin *must* be the ONLY animal in your household.\n\nFor more information on Justin, or to set up a meet and greet, please call or text Ginny at 954-295-7536 between 7pm and 10pm. You can also fill out an application on our website at www.doberescue.net.\n\n*Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer run organization. Any calls/texts received before or after the designated times will be returned the following day.*",

This is Max, a very handsome, healthy 4 year old pitbull, who\u2019s neutered, micro chipped, and up to date on all his shots. He\u2019s extremely sweet with people, easy to harness up, crate trained, knows his basic commands, and is eager to learn. Because he is strong and can be a little jumpy, we don\u2019t recommend young children. He also needs to be the only dog in the house, and no cats please. If you\u2019d like to meet Max, please apply at volauxrescuenj.org\n\nThis dog is currently in a foster home. If you're interested in adopting please email us at volaux@yahoo.com for an adoption application. All dogs are UTD on shots and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. \n\nPLEASE NOTE WE CAN NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK! www.facebook.com/volunteerauxiliary",

These are some things you may want to know about her.   She loves water--she loves toys but not great about sharing. She is very well behaved in the house and doesnt chew items, but does not like being in a kennel. She loves people, but because of her size we think kids 10 years and up in age. Carma doesnt like cats and we say no small dogs.  She would be her best self if she could be the only dog in the family.  That way she can soak up all the love. If interested in Carma give us a call and then fill out an application at 12hillsdogrescue.org and call 402 846 5100\n",

            "description": "Tuco is a sweet dog who loves attention. He enjoys playing with people, but he also likes to just hang out with them. Water and jolly balls are his two favorite toys. He loves these things so much that it can be difficult to pull him away from them.\nBorn in 2015, Tuco came to Best Friends from a shelter in California. He will guard food and has shown other guarding behaviors. Tuco also has some handling issues, especially during medical checkups. He especially doesn't like having his feet or ears touched. His caregivers at the Sanctuary are working with him to decrease his food guarding and to improve his ability to be handled. \nTuco has done well with all the dogs he's met at the Sanctuary and has even passed a cat test here. He has also lived with small dogs successfully before. When the weather is warm, Tuco could happily live in the Dogtown dog park pool, but he'd be even happier to go home with you.",

FOR PARTIALLY SPONSORING SALEM'S ADOPTION FEE**\n\nThis gorgeous girl is so deserving of a wonderful home that will give her all the love, attention, and care she was deprived of for so long. Salem is a 6.5 year old spayed female lab/terrier mix who weighs 55 lbs. Salem and her friend, Abraham, were seized from their neglectful owners last year. They were forced to call a chaotic shelter home for seven months as a court case was brought against their former \"family.\" We were happy to save Salem and bring her to a wonderful foster home. Being a loved family pet was totally new to Salem when we first rescued her, but she has learned to love napping on couches, playing with toys, and snuggling with her foster family. She gives the sweetest kisses too! Salem is a bit shy in new situations, but who can blame her after having such a rough start to life? Because she can be shy at first, she is looking for a home without young children who may overwhelm her. New sights and sounds are still a little scary, so she'd benefit from a calm home in a quieter neighborhood. She loves spending time outside, exploring everything the great outdoors has to offer. This silly girl can't help but want to chase small critters, so she will need a home without small pets, including cats. She has been very selective with her doggie friends, so we feel she needs to be the center of her new forever familes home as an only pet. Salem seems to be housebroken, is comfortable in her crate, and and is food motivated. Please help us find Salem the forever family she has waited her entire for!\n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Kollin is a sweet and happy boy looking for his forever home! He was found abandoned with his siblings when he was around 3 months old. Kollin found a home and was healthy and happy for a while. As he got older, he started to develop anxiety that turned into aggression when around other dogs. Unfortunately, he is no longer a good fit in the home he is in now since there are other dogs he doesn't get along with. His anxiety is starting to take a toll on his health, and we believe he will be much happier in an only-animal home!  \n\nHe is a super fun, spunky doofus that would love a nice quiet place with a big yard for him to zoom in and throw his toys around. He is fixed, up to date on all vaccines, and crate trained. He would do best in a home without other animals and without small children. He loves to cuddle and ride in the car and will make a wonderful companion for the right person! Belly rubs and long hikes are the way to this boy's heart and when he loves a person, he loves them with everything!\n\nEmail beaglebasecamp@gmail.com for any questions or inquiries!",

I'm a 5-year-old small 8-pound Bichon Frise mix. I am fun, loving and full of spirit! They call me a SPECIAL NEEDS PUP. I took a fall before becoming a BROC BABE and the doctors said I would NEVER walk again due to a spinal cord rupture. But my foster mom says I have the will to get wherever I want, nothing holds me back. My BROC Aunties got some custom wheels for me and you should see me run. I'm like a horse in its chariot, and I must say, I do look adorable. I take walks with and without my wheels, I walk with all my fur siblings and chase bunnies like no other but I need my wheels at times.\n\nMy foster mom loves me and takes great care of me. I am still practicing walking and recovering and could use some help with my medical bills and daily needs. If you'd like to sponsor me, please use the link below. Thank you!\n\nSponsor Me: https://bichonrescueoc.org/sponsorship",

            "description": "We would like for you all to meet MJ, or as we lovingly call her: Big Mama!\nNearly four years ago, Big Mama's family reached out to us for help with her litter of puppies although they wanted to keep mom. We took in her 7 puppies and they became the \"A Pups!\" Those 7 babies found woderful homes and the familyreached out to us now, all these years later, to surrender her.\nThis golden girl is a mere 8 years old and you wouldn't know it at all! She is full of life and is as strong as an ox. She rolled into rescue at 78 lbs, but she lost 8 lbs and looking so much better! \nBig Mama likes other dogs, but she can be reactive towards negative behaviors from other dogs. She is curious of all dogs and loves to see our own pups (she loves our Scout and Maizy!), so she can have doggie friends, they just need to be pretty low key. Definitely no cats! \nMJ has met plenty of kids in the neighborhood and she appreciates their attention as much as any other person--she simply ADORES people of all shapes and sizes! She has not met a stranger. \nMJ is the perfect companion. She loves attention but she does not seek it out--zero demands! She will sit by your side for hours on end, she is just happy all day long. \nMJ is working on leash skills. This is her only challenge. She can be pretty stubborn which makes a leash walk pretty time consuming, but we are working on it!\nHer day here consists of:\n1. Early morning rise, out to the lawn with foster dad to lounge while he reads the news. Mid-morning siesta on the deck in the sunshine\n3. Late morning snuggles with (insert any family member here)\n4. Early afternoon siesta on the deck in the shade\n5. Chase squirrels until dusk\n6. Snuggle, siesta, snuggle...\nIf you have never considered adopting a senior--they are full of wonder and life and are so freaking low-maintenance! As easy as they come!\nMJ is being fostered in Decatur, GA. $150 to adopt this beauty! For more info: www.pmarinc.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Lucy is an 18 month old Pitbull mix. She is spayed and current on vaccinations and preventives. She is on the shy side but she loves human company. She is good with other dogs as long as they aren't overly hyper. There are both small dogs and dogs her size at her foster home. She is looking for a family who needs the love of a loyal dog. We don't have much history on Lucy as she was a stray that was not claimed. She does great in her foster home with going outside to potty but this may be the first time she has been allowed to live inside with her humans. There are no kids in her foster home, so we don't know how she would do with small children. She sure loves all of the bigger humans that she meets, so she should do well with older children. The couch has become her favorite place, although she does go into her open kennel by choice for some time alone.",

He will be neutered before being adopted by his new family.\n\nOz was neutered on July 29, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n\n",

In his time with us he has become better about these things but requires a confident owner and prefers a dog friend that knows to take the lead in his uncertainty. \n\nKodak requires a fenced yard. He prefers laidback, confident dog friends and has a group that he enjoys playing with regularly at the rescue. He is smart and agile and loves to run the yard and explore. His favorite toy is a tennis ball and he will gladly chase it! \n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

I can be selective on which dogs I get along with, and I really don't like cats. So, I must not have a kitty in the home with me. If you think 2020 was a bad year, I can make things a lot easier for you by being your best friend! If you need someone to go for car rides with, or set on the couch with you and watch a good movie....or just spend some time together, I am the girl for you! I will not only be your best friend, but I will be a great addition to home protection! I will let you know if someone is at the door, but you will have to put me up before you just let someone in because I will try to protect you. See, that's the kind of friend I am! Unconditional Love is what you get with me! So go to the Forest County Humane Society website and submit an application for me today! Come on and see me! I need a home, please consider me...lets start the New Year together on a better note and you can call me your friend, Bon Bon <3\nIf you would like to see a video of me please go to http://bit.ly/AdoptableDogVideos\nSL # 268240For best response to an inquiry about this animal, please visit www.forestcountyhumanesociety.org, fill out an application and return it to us.

She loves to go for rides, walks, plays ball ... one of the all around greatest dogs ever! We are shocked she is still here! Brown Sugar needs to be an only dog. She loves people more than anything but absolutely has to be the only dog. Even if you have dog visitors, or want to frequent dog parks... she is not the girl for you. Although this may seem like a big set back, its really not if you have no other dogs and enjoy hiking or driving around and need a great companion. She is a strong girl. She needs to have a fenced in yard to ensure she is not going to encounter other dogs. If you want a companion dog that and have an active life style but really like to social distance ... get a hold of us today! This dog is right for you!

He slept under cars to stay cool and would wander off when people showed up and come back at night to go under a vehicle. We heard about his sad existence and we brought him into our rescue. He is 3 to 4 years old and 65 lbs. He is a true protector of his home. He prefers females but with slow introductions he is ok with his male foster parent. He is house and crate trained. He is curious with cats and great with dogs after proper introductions. He is truly \"the flying dog\". He loves to be outside and will jump from the dock into the water to catch a frisbee as well as launch himself on top of something high to jump onto a passing dog buddy as if he is jumping into a wrestling ring! lol...Prince has huge potential for the family or single person that wants to invest their time and love into him. The perfect family will be active in nature and outdoors and understanding of him wanting to be a part of you and your life. He loves to give kisses and loves to be with his humans.",

            "description": "Say hello to Charlie! Charlie is a Black Mouth Cur who was found in an abandoned home with no food and a dirty mattress to sleep on. He was all alone and hungry so our rescuer took him home for some TLC. After some good food, a warm bed, and love, Charlie is thriving and ready for his own forever family. He is around 55 pounds and may get bigger. Full of energy, this pup's favorite pass time is running around the yard and playing with his foster siblings. Because of his rough beginning, Charlie is a little wary of new people but is not aggressive and will warm up very fast. He is working on potty training, is neutered, up to date on shots, and micro-chipped. Charlie has not been around children or cats yet so we can't be certain how he will be with them so a home with older children would probably be best. If you are interested in meeting this lovable ball of energy, please head over to www.ootwrescue.org and submit an application.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

            "description": "Meet Bindi,\nBindi is a very special 4 year old female Pitbull mix looking for a special home she can call furever. \n\nBindi\u2019s home must have:\nA fenced yard (4 feet or taller)\n1 or more dogs her size or larger (about 55lbs)\nNo Cats\nNo Children \u2013 even as visitors\nA strong reliable confident handler\nNot much is known about Bindi\u2019s life before she came to WOFAR, what we do know is that it must have been a rough one.\nIn her time with us Bindi has learned to play with other dogs and to rely on them for companionship and social cues in a variety of situations; she has also learned techniques that help her rely on her handler and their tools to maintain a safe working relationship and environment.\nBindi is a dog with a lot of anxious energy but she has learned to thrive in an environment that uses structure and routine to help her expend that energy through training, exercise, and play. Some of Bindi\u2019s favorite energy burning activities include:\nAgility style weave poles\nStructured and redirected walks\nControlled hiking\nYard play\nHide and seek\nBasic obedience drills\nIn her current foster home Bindi has shown that she readily accepts her roll as a member of a four-dog pack. She also recognizes that her foster mom holds total authority. HOWEVER, she will push back from time to time and does challenge the authority of other humans in the house; she is a real boundary pusher and it is important that her furever family recognize that and be prepared to set and enforce strong firm boundaries. \nTo get Bindi to where she is in her training we have utilized tools that sometimes carry a stigma and her continued success will depend on her families willingness to use those tools which include:\nA Prong Collar\nA Muzzle\nA Drag Leash\nA Short Lead\nA Solid/Indestructible Crate\nSome of Bindi\u2019s other favorite activities include:\nSnuggling\nEating\nLeisure Walks\nCar Rides\nBindi is the kind of snuggle buddy that does all she can to share your skin and while her foster family loves this, it is a behavior they recognize should be limited and monitored as it can lead her to expressing possessive behaviors in an unhealthy manner. \n\nBindi is house trained to a schedule, and crates easily.\nWhen home alone Bindi can be left to roam the house with calm non-destructive dogs without a problem. However, she will join the party if someone else starts it.\nCurrently, Bindi sleeps in her own bed beside her handler at night; she does push for being in the bed with her handler but this should not be permitted.\nBindi knows and understands the basics of obedience but they represent a struggle within her and as such practicing them daily is an amazing way to expend mental and physical energy.\nBindi is anxious and shy about meeting anyone canine or human while on leash or when they care coming into her space; her foster mom has worked with her to develop a routine and procedure for meeting new friends in both circumstances so that everyone is safe and successful.\nIn addition to her training and behavioral needs Bindi has bad eyes. She has learned to accept her twice daily drops with little to no push back; and also takes Benadryl to help control it all.\nBindi\u2019s Foster mom is dedicated to working with her furever family and home to set everyone up for success by showing them how to use the training tools and techniques that have gotten Bindi to where she is today and helping to set routines and schedules.\nhttps://www.jotform.com/WOFARinc/WOFAR-Adoption-Application",

Everyone who meets me comments on how adorable and sweet I am.\n\nIt is particularly amazing that I'm so sweet given how I spent the first part of my life.  Believe it or not, I lived at the end of a chain.  I was a \"hunting dog\" but mostly just laid around a grassless yard with no place to go.  There were a bunch of other beagles in the yard but we didn't really get to play since we were all on chains and couldn't reach each other.  \n\nMiraculously, this amazing group of people came in and talked the hunter into giving me up.  Now I live with another dog and a human kid and life is sooooo much better.  I can walk around all day long if I want in our fenced in yard and I sleep on comfy beds.  I love to nap on the patio.   Life is so great now and I have become accustomed to it quite nicely.  \n\nI am up to date on my vaccines and am microchipped and am on monthly preventatives.  I'm scheduled to be neutered in March.  (That was the first available appointment we could get!!)\n\nI have something called \"cherry eye\".  Basically a gland in my eye is bulging out.  It sounds and looks worse than it is.  It is fairly common.  Also the vet looked at it and said that it is not causing any problems and he does not recommend any treatment for it at this time.  But while I'm under anesthesia for my neuter, we'll see if the vet can do anything about it. \n\nI'm a pretty chill guy.  At 6+ years old, I like to get in some exercise during the day but I also am a champion napper and sleeper.  I walk nicely on a leash and I'm crate trained.  \n\nAlso, my foster mom said that I had to mention that I have dimples.  It doesn't get cuter than that!  \n\nAnd I'm a really good snuggler!!!\n\nI'm looking for a forever home where I can make up for lost time.  I can't wait to be a pet and get lots of love and attention.  If you would like to meet me, please contact karenquinn14@gmail.com.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nBernard",

            "description": "Blitzen is a 5-year-old, 65 lb. Great Pyrenees/German Shepherd mix looking to find her forever home. She is a sweet-natured dog with her people.  Typical of her breed, she is loyal, loving, and sweet to those she trusts.  She is house trained and a dream on a leash.  She is certainly a beautiful girl!\n\nShe needs to be the only pet in her castle, so no other dogs or cats can share her space.  Only kids over 12 for Blitzen and she will need a fenced yard.  Blitzen is not a candidate for apartment or condo living or first-time-dog-owner and she will need someone with breed experience. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blitzen, please complete an application then reach out to Debbie@bigfluffydogs.com. Please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Roman cannot be wait to be loved and spoiled for the rest of his life!!!!\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes.

He is a well mannered dog who has a very sweet nature.  He has not pottied in his crate or in the house.  He is working on his obedience commands and so far he has mastered \u201cCome\u201d and \u201cSit.\u201d  \n\nRiddle loves hiking in the woods behind his foster home; hiking brings out the puppy in him.   \n\nRiddle is currently living in a foster home in the Memphis area, where for the first time, he is learning the ropes of being a pampered pooch.\n\nRiddle has heartworms, and he has begun the slow kill treatment for his heartworms.  \n\nBecause Riddle has some scarring from his past life, we think it is best that he be an only dog.  He will need a securely fenced yard and to be monitored when he is outside exercising.  Why?  Because he can climb as well as a cat!!!  \n\nHe is looking for an ultra loving and responsible home that will give him security, love and a solid routine.  Riddle is on the search for his perfect family.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.\n\n*4 years old\n*Housetrained\n*Crate trained\n*Wants to be the only dog",

If you sit on the floor or ground she has to sit on your lap. All around polite dog. She loves car rides and does really well. She gets excited when the leash comes out but will sit to be leashed up.   She will sit and wait for her food until you tell her it's ok. She is not really treat motivated or toy motivated. She will carry a toy around in her mouth but that's it.  She loves short walks or long walks with rest breaks.  She is a pleaser and LOVES and gets excited to see all people.  Stella does need to be the only dog in the home but can be walked in public as she doesn\u2019t react to seeing other dogs.  She is gentle with children and all people but we don\u2019t recommend her with little children or anyone that can easily be knocked over.  It\u2019s really hard to describe how awesome Stella is so if you are interested please reach out to meet her.  If you want to be the lucky family that adopts Stella, please fill out an application at https://m.friendsfurliferescue.com/ADOPTION-FORM.html\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.This ridiculously gorgeous boy is Pepperidge! He is around 10 months old, so he still has some growing room in his big ol 65-75 lb body. He's an American Bulldog mix, but honestly we think he's pure goofy adorable mush ball! He is so fun, playful, and loves to cuddle. Although he doesn't know his size, and he can't be around small/older dogs or cats that aren't dog friendly, he does request that he has a fur sibling. He does have some boundary issues, can be nervous at times, and he can miss ques. Because of this we request he goes to a home without small children. Pepperidge is potty trained, and kennel trained for short periods of time. This boy needs someone that is extremely active because he does get bored easily, but he is EXTREMELY treat/food motivated! This sweet amazing boy would make the perfect addition to your family if you are searching for unconditional love!\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Pepperidge is $225 and includes his neuter, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

He would be fine in a home with other dogs as well and would love an active home. \n\nPharaoh loves treats and is very eager to learn and food motivated so it makes it easier to teach him things. He does sit, lay down and will roll over for belly rubs! He also runs right into his crate for treats. Pharoah was sent for some basic training recently and doing well! He now walks great on leash. He was also cat tested while he was at the training facility and is cat friendly! \n\nPharaoh is up to date on all shots, neutered and micro-chipped. He is also heartworm negative. He is available locally for meet and greets. He can also be transported out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee.",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nMeet Froy!\n\nFroy is a lovely, sweet, 3 year old GSD who came to Indigo Rescue in very sad shape. Her owner passed away and she had terrible skin allergies which had caused her to lose all of her hair. Her skin was purple and inflamed. She was not well socialized with other dogs.\n\nEnter the beauty of a loving foster home! We put Froy on a prescription diet for allergies, and her foster used a medicated shampoo and rubbed coconut oil into her inflamed skin. Froy responded wonderfully! Within less than a month her skin was recovering, and now, just a few months later her coat has grown in beautifully. Froy did turn out to have a hypothyroid contributing to her skin issues so she will need to continue taking medication for that.\n\nFroy is a sweet girl who true to her breed, is her human\u2019s shadow. She has learned how to play and interact with other dogs in her foster home and now she can tolerate her person being out of her sight as long as she is with another dog companion. She\u2019s a bit of a toy hog, and she\u2019s a bit mischievous, but she gets along very well with dogs who are friendly and playful. Froy can still be barky when she sees other dogs while on a walk. She responds well to good leadership though. \n\nOur criteria for placement of Froy are; a commitment to her allergy diet and medication, a securely fenced yard, a human or humans with dog leadership skills, and a friendly dog companion who is not a senior dog.\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

We're not sure what happened to Chevy and how he came to be covered in wounds and bites, but we suspect he was hit in the head with a fire poker. Despite an obvious rough life, Chevy is a sweetheart who is good with people, other dogs, with proper introductions and even cats! He will do best in a suburban setting, with an experienced owner and older children (if there are children). He is housetrained, great on a leash, neutered and\nup to date on vaccinations.\nChevy is a lower-energy love bug who loves to cuddle up on the couch and snuggle with his person. The only thing is that he hasn't yet found his person. Or his person hasn't found him! If you are Chevy's person, please apply online at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

She loves to go for car rides, hang out with people and play. She loves her butt and ears scratched. Emmy loves to swim in a pool too!! Emmy would do best as the only dog.  Unfortunately,  we do not know how she is with cats. Emmy would be a wonderful companion dog for an empty nester. She would do best in a quiet home.  Emmy requires a fenced yard where she can safely run and play. This gorgeous girl is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on monthly heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained.  Emmy is a very loving girl that is looking to be loved and spoiled for the rest of her life.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. \nEmmy's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "Angel loves to cuddle and sleep on your lap. She's full of energy and likes to play and run around. She's good with cats and would do best in an only dog home. She can be a little shy and skittish around new people but she warms up pretty quick and then wants to be your best friend. She chatters her teeth when she gets excited and its super cute. Sometimes she gets a little scared of traffic while going for a walk but its usually not a problem. She is potty trained and crate trained and also seems to be potty pad trained. Vet is guessing she may be 7yrs old and under 15 lbs. She is UTD on shots and spayed. She is on flea & hw preventative. If Angel seems like the perfect addition to your family please fill out the application on our website.\n\nAngel's Adoption fee is $300.\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt adoption, please fill out app at\n\nhttp://heidislegacydogrescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nThank you for completing the application.

She is good with people, but does not seem to get along with other dogs or cats. Sky is very active and playful and has the ability to climb out of a 6 ft chain link fence.\n\nWith the Covid-19 situation, FURS has temporarily stopped our weekly adoption stands.  We can make alternate arrangements for meeting the FURS dogs but would require an approved application for adoption.  There is no fee or obligation with submitting an adoption application and applications can be completed on line at www.fursdogs.com\n\nA required step of our adoption process is to conduct a home visit.  Since FURS is a very small, all-volunteer rescue, we can only support our adoption process to homes in the Richmond, VA and surrounding localities area",

He freakin\u2019 loves puppies and small dogs! He\u2019s happy to be their favorite toy and jungle gym! He loves his tennis balls and will keep himself busy with chew bones and toys.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAvailable for adoption \n\nAdoption fee of $460 includes age appropriate vaccinations and spay/neuter when pup is approximately 5-6 months of age at participating veterinarians.\n\nAdoption Process: \nSend an email to info@therileyrescue.com requesting an adoption application. \nComplete the adoption application and submit it via email. \nOnce approved an appointment will be set to meet the puppy/dog. \nIf all goes well at the meeting your new pet will go home with you that same day. \n\nAll dogs and puppies have been seen at least once by a licensed veterinarian, have had age appropriate vaccinations and have been deemed healthy for adoption.",

            "description": "Dah lings -- Hello! Dee Dee here with my views on the proper habitat for someone such as myself you know, a beautiful, highly intelligent, young girl that is often mistaken as a potbelly pig (which is soooo offensive!). As it appears, my spunky personality, beautiful looks, perfect pizza ears, are not enough these days as I am still sitting in the shelter imploring these people to get me a home. They obviously are not doing a good enough job, so here I am typing this myself! All a girl like me needs is the following:\n1. Luxurious accommodations (a fluffy bed, a warm lap, and some toys for me to play with) \n2. Decadent meals (lovely kibble served in a bowl diamond chipped preferably - with a tall glass (or bowl) of water)\n3. Exquisite landscaping (beautiful green grass for me to roll around on)\n4. Benevolent family (people who will find me as amazing as I find them, who will rub my belly, play with me, take me for runs, and allow me to kiss them incessantly if I so chose)\nDespite my many wonderful qualities, since I am 45 pounds of playfulness, and I like to chase small furry things, you might not want to have a cat, or other dogs. I am all you need. So, tell me, are you able to provide me the proper habitat I require? Or do you know someone who is? Please share with them my post! Thanks Dah-lings! Tah Tah!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting (or fostering!) one of our Don't Bully Us Rescue puppies or dogs please go www.dontbullyusrescue.org and fill out an online application. You can also go to our website www.dontbullyus.com for adoption, volunteer and foster applications. If you know the name of the pup, add it to your application. If you don't know the name of the puppy, just add a brief description of it! After approving your application, we will contact you for a meet and greet!\n\nWe have dogs ranging from newborn puppies to senior dogs in our rescue all looking for their forever homes. You can check out our latest pictures of our adoptable pups and dogs on our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/dontbullyusrescue . Also on our Facebook Page check out our Event section, this will tell you were we will be for our next adoption event. We usually have adoption events every weekend, giving you the chance to meet some of our wonderful adoptable pups in person. Thank you for taking the time to check us out, we look forward to receiving your application!\n\nPlease note: Due to restrictions and bans on bully breeds, we are unable to adopt out to renters and active Military personnel but we are working on changing perspectives and discriminatory Breed Specific Legislation for these wonderful dogs!",

She has a terrier\u2019s personality, friendly, upbeat, but no pushover. She\u2019s not been around children since being with Second Chance but she\u2019s been friendly with adults, other than her foster mom.\nBubbles has only been on short car trips but she\u2019s been comfortable looking out the window and checking the world out.  She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines.  Good vet history, fenced yard, and home visit required.  Fee:  $200.

            "description": "Handsome Strong Boy Bronson is looking for his forever homeBronson is a very handsome one year old red male that was surrendered to DRM because his owners were not experienced enough to handle him after they adopted him from a shelter. He is crate trained, and once his foster mom tells him it's time to go to the crate, he will open the crate door by himself and go in and wait for his good boy treat. He is house trained and fairly good on a leash. Bronson will require a home with breed expertise and structure. He would do best in a home with no cats or kids as he is a pretty rambunctious boy with a strong prey drive. He is learning everyday in his foster home.\n\nBronson loves to play with toys. If it's a toy he can chase, make squeak, or shake the life out of, it's a favorite toy. Bronson will play independently, but his favorite games are fetch and tug of war, and for those games he pretty much insists you play with him. He also loves to go for rides in the truck and is learning good manners on the road. One of his favorite down time activities is to lay in front of the deck windows soaking up the sun and watching the world go by. He especially likes to lay his head in your lap to get a head and neck massage. Bronson is very smart and very food motivated, which is a great combination for learning commands and behaviors quickly. He has learned sit, down, wait, stay, shake (either paw based upon which hand you put out), leave it, etc. He has also learned to sit and wait to eat until he is released to eat, and many other good manner behaviors.\n\nBronson is an awesome dog, and will be required to go to a home with a big fenced in yard to run and play in, and with people who understand what it takes to be a pack leader.\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

Although he has been fostered with many other dogs he is not very playful with them.  He is more into his human family and going on walks and eating his meals. We typically do a slow intro with new foster dogs and then he is fine. Needs a slower intro with small dogs. He is not good with cats but lives with a bird. Beauford has a small swollen lymph node that has been tested and is negative for cancer. It has gotten smaller with time and not very noticeable now. Beauford is a parvo survivor!!!

For more information or to set up an appointment, contact Rachael at rwilson@midlandshumanesociety.org or (712)396-2265**\n\nTuck is a sweet, but sensitive fellow looking for a laid back home where he can acclimate at his own pace. Tuck likes to play but has moderate-low energy. He would prefer to snooze on the couch next to you instead! \n\nTuck needs a home with experience with large breeds. He is very strong & might be protective of his home or owned. He will do best in a home without a lot of visitors or commotion. \n\nTuck is friendly & easy going with most people, but does not like to be handled roughly so we recommend a home with adults only.\nTuck did not do well with animals in his previous home so he wants to soak up all the attention as your only pet!\n\nTuck is not suitable for apartment living & a fence is required. \n\nThis is an adult dog and the adoption cost is $150, which covers microchip, all shots, and spaying or neutering. Come out to meet all of our adoptable animals today! \n\n -----------------------------------\n\n This dog is at Midlands Humane Society located at 1020 Railroad Avenue, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 Please email or call them at 712-396-2270 midlandshumanesociety@gmail.com \n\n http://midlandshumanesociety.org/\n\nHours of Operation:\nMonday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,Friday 12:00pm - 6:00pm\nSaturday 11am-5pm\nSunday 11am-3pm",

I'm also 7-years young.\n\nI'm starting to get a little snow on my face, but I've still got plenty of pep in my step! I love to go on walks and play in the yard. I also love a good back scratch and chest rub. I have a tickle spot on my chest, and if you scratch it just right, my leg goes up and down really fast.\n\nOh and treats! I love yummy treats! I am house, crate, and leash trained and I know some cool tricks like sit. I'm quite the catch, if I do say so myself!\n\nMy only special request is a home without children or other pets. But don't worry, I'll give you all the love you could ever need. I'm a sweet and affectionate girl, and I can't wait to find my forever family to share that love with them!\n\nCheck out Kaytie's TV Spot: http://bit.ly/Kaytie\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

This goofball loves to play with other dogs and loves people.  Hondo has extremely short hair that unfortunately causes him to get marked up very easily when he plays with his buddies.  Hondo loves to snuggle and curl up with his humans and enjoys being close to his people.  Hondo is 70 pounds and loves playing with his toys and chase around the yard with all his doggy buddies, he would love a home with a big yard!  Hondo is an extremely strong agile boy that can jump around 3-4 ft so needs a 6 ft fence he is a good boy and stays in the yard.  Although Hondo has been great with both male and female fosters, for long term success we think a female friend is preferable.  No cats for this boy.  Hondo is fixed, microchipped,  and fully vaccinated.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting this sweet boy, please fill out an application http://ozziespoundpuppies.org/online-application/. Adoption fee is $275\nAll dogs adopted are up to date on shots, dewormed, microchip and fixed. We will assist in introductions to other family members, both human and furry ones. Our adoption fee is $275.00\n\n***Please note we are a home/foster based organization. All dog introductions are by application on file and appointment only.",

Hercules lives up to his name! He's a protector and strong.\n\nHe'll need an assertive and confident leader to keep on with his training, and he would do best with a furry friend to keep him busy. If he's bored he's usually into something...silly boy! As much as he loves to play he's equally as snuggly and gives no personal space. There's some days he doesn't stroll out of bed until noon. He's a goof and has so much love to offer! Hercules love, love, loves toys and is extremely food motivated.\n\nPlease fill out an application if you can open your heart and home to Hercules!\n\n*Due to border restrictions and breed-specific legislation we cannot adopt out to Canada*\n\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

She is working with a trainer to walk on a leash (she had no training), she knows sit and down and place.  She needs to be the only dog as she is dog selective.  She will also need a fenced back yard and an adopterthat is a strong pack leader.  Our trainer will work with the new adopter to show you to continue with Paddy's good work.

The staff adores him and the volunteers gush over how easy and sweet Djibouti is. He's a super-sized guy who greets us every morning with a one-eared salute. That left ear is constantly in \"Go north!\" mode. Djibouti walks nicely on leash and knows a few commands. He's very eager to meet strangers and loves affection above anything else. He will be a loyal, loving companion. It doesn't hurt that he's a total heartthrob, too. If you're looking for a larger size, friendly, well-adjusted companion, and a total love of a boy, you need to meet this guy. He is the jam! Come take him out for a walk and see if he's the one!\n",

They go everywhere together, and Babe is a now veteran of the Atlanta social scene. You will often see him mingling in the crowd, a glass of champagne in one paw and a festive party snack in the other. He is a polite, easy guest and has exceedingly good manners, all, he tells us, self-taught. He looks you right in the eyes, smiles, and makes you feel a little dizzy with The Love. This guy is such a hunk!!!\nBabe has some skin allergies, which can be managed with medication. He is a lover of people, all people, and a friend to other dogs. He is house-trained and is now very familiar with living in a home. Babe is a dream, friends. If you would like to meet him, reach out and we will make it happen.",

Hes very friendly to people who are welcomed into his space, but can be timid around men outside. Hes excited to meet people and show off his toys! He LOVES walking and gets really excited when he sees the leash. Rex was unfortunately attacked by another dog in his past and is dog selective. In the shelter he did well with other dogs in the \"daycare\" setting, but is now working through some leash aggression issues when he is outdoors and on walks. He does get along well with a female staffy owned by the foster's friend. Rex needs a capable owner with bully-breed experience who is willing to put time and patience into socializing him and desensitizing him to animal stimulation when walking. A home with a fenced in yard would be best, but an owner without a yard who is committed to working through his quirks with a professional trainer would also be okay. He should be the only dog in the home. He has a ton of love to give his people and would love nothing more than to snuggle up in a forever home!",

Adjusting to life as a shelter dog has required a lot of courage and strength of this small shepherd-mix girl. We didn't want to push Jacey beyond her comfort zone, so we have moved slowly, and have been steadily working to gain her trust. It is working, and we think she is ready to find her home. She needs a hero. She needs someone who can see beyond her fear and really see HER. Jacey needs a quiet, stable home with or without dogs, where she can relax. She needs someone patient, who will love and protect her. She feels vulnerable outside her routine, so she can be a flight risk. She needs someone to show her the ropes and help her find her way. Jacey may never be a traditional dog-park, socially adept \"pet me\" kind of dog, but she will still be a wonderful companion. She needs you. Her eyes say it all. No kids, please. Questions? Message us. #adoptadog #whywerescue #thinkrescue\n",

            "description": "Our love affair with Milo the Love Potato goes way back. We met him years ago, when he was a young pup someone dropped over our shelter fence one night. When we first saw him, he bounded out of darkness and we froze, unsure of what to do. We still laugh about that moment six years later. All wiggly-bottomed and excited, he plopped down, rolled onto his back, legs splayed in all directions, for a belly rub. Instantly, we fell in love with his sweetness. It's hard not to. Two of our staffers fostered Milo in their home, along with two other pibble-mixes, and they were a dream team together. He was perfect. So, perfect, his foster moms knew Milo would thrive in an adoptive home. He found a family, and was adopted along with another puggle from PAWS Atlanta. They would be BFF's for 5+ years, until Milo's puggle companion and his beloved human father passed away within a short time of each other. Milo's mom eventually decided to adopt another young dog who, in turn, Milo did not take to. So, he is back with us, and back at square one again. But, here's the thing:\nMilo is grown now (almost 8) and he's a tripod (accident long ago in his home), and he's a little bewildered and saddened by his change of fortune. But, he's still perfect. He's funny, endearing, playful, up-for-anything, adores car rides and feeling his ears flapping in the wind. He's still wiggly-bottomed and joyful. He's still a lapdog, through and through. \nHe's impossible to photograph because he immediately drops on his back as splays himself out like a russet potato at your feet. He's just a good, good, good boy. \nWe think he would feel most comfortable as an only dog. We're not sure on cats, but we can test him. Milo is such a great dog. If you're interested in meeting him, please fill out an adoption application at PAWSAtlanta.org and we'll get you scheduled for an appointment to come spend some time with Milo.",

            "description": "***COVID 19 NOVEMBER 2020 PROTOCOL***\n\nDue to the surge of Covid 19 and statewide restrictions, we are adopting to LOCAL (CLALLAM AND JEFFERSON COUNTY) RESIDENTS ONLY. We are not doing adoptions to Canada at this time due to the border closure. We do not ship animals. \n\nAll potential adopters must fill out an adoption application prior to setting up an appointment to meet the animal. An application can be found on our website.\n\nWe have limited staff during this time, please allow 3-5 business days for us to process your application. We are screening the applications for the first BEST fit for each animal. \n\nIf you are approved, you will be contacted by us via phone or email.\n\nNAME: Hawk\nAGE: About 2 years\nWEIGHT: About 50 lbs\nBREED(S): Pit bull mix\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL: Transfer from California\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY: Hawk is a goofy young boy with lots of learning to do. He is very intelligent and is picking up clicker training and many commands quickly! He absolutely loves his toys and playing around outside and is very food motivated.\n\nWhen Hawk sees other dogs on leash or through a fence, he will get overstimulated and bark. He definitely needs work on learning to be calm when he sees other animals, which is something we are working on with him. At this time he should not live with other dogs and he most likely will not be good with cats.\n\nHawk will need a calm owner who will establish clear boundaries and be the leader. He does really well with a calm handler who does not let him get away with things such as jumping up or chewing on the leash. He will need someone who will direct him on how to behave but encourage him to do so in a positive way (he has been making great progress with clicker and treat training!). \n\nHawk is a very intelligent dog and a playful guy but is not for a first time dog owner nor an apartment. He really is just an overgrown puppy who is still learning how to be a good boy. \n\nHawk has had many hours of training at OPHS, and his adoption fee will include an hour of training for his adopter from our KPA certified trainer. \n\nActivity Level? High\nTraining Needs? High\nHouse Trained? Unknown\nLeash Trained? Yes \nComfortable with kids? Recommend no kids because he's easily over stimulated\nComfortable with strangers? Might need a little time to warm up\nHistory with other dogs? Unknown, at this time we are saying no dogs\nHistory with cats? Unknown but most likely not good\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: None\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: We are making good progress with him on clicker training and loose leash walking. He is not for a first time dog owner or an apartment.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $210 for an adult dog.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.",

            "description": "Sandy wandered into her rescuer's yard and announced she was looking for a loving, responsible family.  \n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in May 2012, Sandy weighs about 45 lb.  She loves to talk and will chat as long as it takes to get her point across.  She will also bark obnoxiously if left outside unattended.\n\nSandy is very affectionate and loves people.  She likes car rides and other polite dogs.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience.\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

Think racing around is really fun - both inside and out? And most importantly, love you with her whole heart and then some? Then Delfina is the \"Girl\" for you! (We nicknamed her Girl!) Delfina is all this and more. She's over the top, living life full blast. And she just knows there's a someone out there who will be as devoted to her as she will be to them. \n\nJust look at her sweet face! She is a happy and fun-loving dog who loves, Loves, LOVES her people! Delfina will benefit from ongoing training to channel her enthusiasm and help her learn boundaries and appropriate play spaces. (She's already nailed the crate training and is housebroken - yay Delfina!) Delfina probably isn't best in a house with wee ones (see the part about diving hellos). She will thrive in a home where she has outdoor space to run around and/or with a family that goes on long walks, or jogs or hikes - you get the idea, this gal needs exercise and space to minimize indoor \"zoomies.\" You can turn everything into a game, as she sniffs out her food, and works for treats. Developing a routine that includes mentally and physically stimulating activities will created a tuckered out pup who will welcome an end of the day snuggle. Delfina isn't sure about other pets and new people as much as she is her \"family people,\" but give her some time and go slow for increased chances of success in her spreading her love around. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JvHR6L_pQc&showinfo=0\n\nIf you think you're the person, or family, to fulfill Delfina's needs, and in return be rewarded with a fantastic, loving companion, send an email to blanchard.michaela@gmail.com and let us know how Delfina would be a great fit in your life.",

            "description": "Meet Nellie!\n\nNellie is a 9 year old female pitbull mix! Nellie was brought into the Mutt Misfits program through a seizure of a local fighting and baiting ring. Nellie was one of many dogs taken from the ring to rehabilitate and help them find their furever homes! Nellie is spayed, up to date on all age appropriate vaccinations, preventatives and she's micro-chipped.\n\n***This dog, along with the over 20 other dogs rescued from a fighting ring, has been assessed for behavior and temperament and approved for adoption. However, since we had training sessions donated to us, we are erring on the side of caution and slowly sending them all through behavioral training that will teach them basic manners and give them a good structure to build on with their forever family. Please inquire as to the status of this dog's training if you're interested in meeting and possibly adopting! The most important thing to us is to ensure that these dogs' horrendous past does not affect the future they deserve to have! ***\n\nNellie is crate trained and potty trained. She has accidents due to being an older lady, but will do it on a designated potty pad! Nellie walks politely on a leash and doesn't care about other dogs on her walks! She rides well in the car and loves to go on special outings for Puppucinos and chicken nuggets. Nellie knows basic commands such as sit, come when called, etc.\n\nNellie has been through an absurd amount of abuse in her life time and it shows in her lack of socialization. Nellie has very awkward social skills and is actively working on making friends with her foster siblings, but much prefers to be with her foster parents and other people! The behavior based training program will help develop her social skills, but Nellie would thrive in a house hold without other animals. She has not been around children or cats. \n\nAt first when Nellie went into her foster home, she had to be picked up and carried out of the car due to being so scared. She was silent and cowered in the corner of her bed in her room. Her foster mom sat in her room and worked on the floor for days to gain her trust. It took her weeks to let her foster dad come near her or even touch her. She didn't understand toys or snacks, but slowly and surely she got more comfortable with her foster parents. She now jumps up on her foster dad and their guests when she plays and doesn't have any fears! She actually prefers her foster dad now, because he plays her favorite game \"Catch the Piggy\" where they chase each other in the yard like a game of tag. Nellie will crawl onto anyone's lap (despite being a chunky girl at 70lbs) and take a happy nap! Nellie is a sweet old lady with a big personality. She has very few teeth due to them being ground down and removed from her abusers. Nellie almost understands how to play fetch and loves to chase after anything you'll throw for her - she hasn't mastered bringing anything back but it's still a very fun game for her. Nellie likes to make nests in all blankets she finds and curls up on the couch to binge watch Netflix! Despite the abuse she's suffered, Nellie has persevered and now loves to be a normal dog. She took a few weeks to get used to men and any new visitors, but has now warmed up to everyone she meets and has always been very loving. Nellie has an infectious-toothless smile and you can't help but fall in love with her!\n\n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt her at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application",

There was fear he would need to be put to sleep because he was acting very odd, and we were contacted to see if our veterinarian could help. He seemed dazed, confused and unable to walk. We hustled out there as soon as we could, determined to help. We had our medical director come to check him out. Our vet believes he had a negative reaction to something. We are happy to report that he is now up and walking and even eating and drinking. We are SO glad that we can offer him a second chance. Despite being a senior, he certainly still has a lot of life left to live. \n\nHe came to us from Monterey County Animal Services.",

Suzette is a smarty pants and knows sit, paw, down, stay, and comes when she is called. Suzette also likes to snuffle to find hidden treats. She is an energetic hiker and likes exploring the great outdoors. (She is working on improving her loose leash walking...it's hard to slow down when there's so much cool stuff to see and sniff!) Her favorite part might actually be the car ride to and from the trail! Suzette gets along with most other dogs but would prefer to be the only dog in the home and with older children. Suzette has spent time in a home and has many positive notes. One of their favorite things about her was that when she wants to snuggle, she will paw you to get some lovin'. Who could resist?!?If you are interested in meeting Suzette go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

She gave birth to 11 puppies, and started to become aggressive, protecting her babies from the fosters. \nAfter getting her back to our ranch, she started to settle down, but she didn't seem happy. \nSoraya got put in a foster home with other dogs, and has come out of her shell, blooming into a more social dog. Soraya will need lots of work and dog friends to keep her improving. She love treats, digging, and rough housing with her friends. She prefers being outside but with time, can enjoy inside time with dog friends.\nUPDATE!!!!! \n    Soraya comes when she's called, but is still a little nervous about being \"trapped\". She's tons of fun, has a great personality and LOVES every other dog she's met. we do think she should be in a family with another dog (or 2) to play with as she is very high energy (she hasn't learned to jump up on things, so the other dogs she's fostered with know they can get on the bed to get away from her!). She's a really good girl though and seems to be completely house trained now.\n\n\n",

Jeff does great with other dogs and people but will require a home without cats (he will chase them.) He loves to play so if there are kids in the home, older kids are best.  He will need daily exercise to help burn his energy. A home with a big backyard would be perfect.  He is mostly housebroken and is doing well on a leash. We think training classes would help Jeff meet his greatest potential in a new home. His estimated DOB is 08-01-2019.

            "description": "Meet Duke. He's a very special boy. We got a call on 1/31/19 that a lady was moving and she couldn't take her dog so we helped her out. She asked if she could visit a week later and let us know that prior to surrendering him, he had gotten out and bit a kid on the way to school. It did not break the skin but he was deemed dangerous until court. The hearing was held the end of March and poor Duke was deemed dangerous so when he's adopted and we have faith there is a perfect home for him, they will have to abide by the dangerous dog rules for their county. The county wanted Animal Friends to surrender Duke but we would not so they worked with us explaining the laws and paperwork that needed filed. He is now the owners of the rescue and being cross-posted until we can find a home for him. He's a sweet boy once he knows you and is very food motivated. He's house trained and has NEVER had an accident since we've had him. He will greet you each time holding his bowl and he loves toys. We have not had any incidents other than him jumping up on us to go for car rides. He's very strong and needs obedience training, like any 2 year old shepherd/pit mix. He does well with other dogs once he knows them and lived with a child that was about 9 years old. We were told that he loves to snuggle and slept in bed with his previous family.\n\nBecause Duke is deemed dangerous, we will arrange meet and greets cautiously and do introductions slowly. He will not be at the adoption events because we don't want to risk another bite. His eyes and personality melted our hearts and we are so thankful Prince William County worked with us to keep this guy alive.\n\nIf interested, applications can be completed at animalfriendsva.org then go to animals and scroll down to Duke. He will need registered as a dangerous dog where ever he is adopted which is $150. Therefore, his adoption fee is $150 which is half price. $150 to Animal Friends and $150 for the dangerous dog fee. If you have questions about the laws in Prince William, please feel free to email us at va.animalfriends@gmail.com.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.",

            "description": "Charlie is a cute little guy who needs a quiet environment and people who are willing to give him time and their understanding and patience. He gets overwhelmed easily and shows it by growling at people. He needs people who understand that his aggressive behavior is the result of fear and not anything personal. For example, he joyfully wags his tail when his foster family comes home and has tolerated a few seconds of petting, but then he goes back to keeping his distance. He will also occasionally sit in his foster Mom's lap and press his head against her arm (she hasn't tried to pet him in those moments because she doesn't want to ruin them by triggering his anxiety). He loves going for walks, but hates moving vehicles (maybe he was hit by a car at some point in his life?), and has shown that he will play bow (only after getting to know his foster for several weeks). We do not recommend him for families with small children.",

We were told he doesn't like men but he has done ok with most of the men he's met. He takes a minute to warm up, well, really if you give him a piece of pepperoni, or greet him with a spoon of peanut butter he's a friend for life. He LOVES to play and has a lot of love to give a family. He will chase squirrels in the back yard for hours too. He has a very strong prey drive and does well with dogs but we don't recommend cats. Because he is fearful of new people, he will not be attending most of our events but we can arrange private meet and greets with approved applicants.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Kinzey, and I am a 6 year old American Foxhound mix. I was adopted 4 years ago, and my new mommy and I were absolutely crazy about each other. Sadly, my new mommy passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. Now, I am back in a foster home, and while I really like it here, I would love to find my fur-ever home again. I am a silly, smart, loveable, playful cuddlebug. I like to play, but I am perfectly content to amuse myself while you do your thing, and I love to snuggle up next to you while you relax. I give the best hugs!!! I'm a little shy around new people, but with a little time and patience, I always come around. I am house-trained and love to go for car rides and WALKS - walks are the BEST!!! My foster says that I am close to being the PERFECT DOG. I attach to my family very quickly and have some anxiety when they leave me alone. I can bust out of crates and would do best in a home with a stay at home parent, not a necessity; however, I have destroyed some things I shouldn't have, such as carpeting and walls because I was trying to get to my family. I am spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all my vaccinations. If you would like to meet me (and I sure HOPE you do!), I will be at our adoption events. We're at the Potomac Mills PetSmart every Sunday from 12:30 - 3:00. The address is 13337 Worth Ave, Woodbridge VA 22192. On the 2nd Saturday of each month we are also at the Lorton PetValu located at 9427 Lorton Market St, Lorton VA. We're there from 12:00 - 2:00. You can also fill out a no-obligation, online application at animalfriendsva.org/animals, and scroll down to Kinzey, (the pretty one waiting for a home!). On that page is my application.",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Nusta. I am an energetic 1.5-year-old female Jack Russell/Pitbull Mix. I was adopted 5 months ago into a home with a 2-year-old male dog, and due to the COVID restrictions shortly after my adoption, I was not able to get the right socializing and professional training I needed to make sure I had a great start to my new life. Now that I've had time to decompress after shelter life, and with guidance from my Vet, I've decided I want to be the only fur baby in my owner's heart, and need to find a new forever home that can provide me with that. I love walks and all physical activity, my nickname is Shakira because I can't stop shaking my hips when I see a leash. I make a great running and hiking buddy, and sticking my head out a car window is my favorite thing. I need a home with no other animals and no small children as I get very protective over my stuffed toys. I also require an experienced owner who will give me the structure and daily exercise I need to be a happy girl. I am housebroken, crate trained for overnight sleep, and very well-behaved indoors and respectful of furniture. I like to please and give my humans love every chance I get, and I can also entertain myself when needed. My current family has acquired a lot of great supplies for me that I will take to my new home, including XL Crate with memory foam mattress, training collar with remote, hands-free leash, rain, and snow coats. I'm also on a great Banfield wellness plan that can be transferred over to cover my remaining puppy shots and tests until December 2020. My current family knows that I will need professional training and willing to provide a stipend to the new owner to make sure I make it my forever home and get the life I deserve. I look forward to making you smile every day with my adorable Jack Russell ears and soulful honey-colored eyes.\n\nPlease contact Rose at vineyardsocials@gmail.com\n\nThese dogs are looking for homes through private parties in the Los Angeles CA area.

He needs to be the only dog of an experienced owner who has been around working dogs and understands the need for consistency, structure, leadership, exercise and a job. He is a big, 80 lbs who loves his daily exercise and needs to be active. He will like nothing better than hiking or going on long walks and learning new things to keep his mind active. He is fully trained with follow up lessons with his new owner included.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our dogs please complete an adoption or foster application on our website at www.happyheartsgsr.org. Also please follow us and get the latest updates on our dogs on facebook at www.facebook.com/HappyHeartsGSDRescue.",

            "description": "Our Dingo might not be from Australia, but she would sure like to travel with you! Dingo is the perfect travel size canine, only weighing in at 29 lbs. She has her bags packed and is ready to hit the road! Dingo is hoping to find someone else that will enjoy her favorite things, munching on snacks and people watching. Her foster mom reports that she is sweet, loves to snuggle, is a good listener, and responds well to correction. Dingo prefers the company of adults and can take a little time to warm up to new people. She can be a bit selective with her dog friends and will need a home without kitties. Want to meet Dingo? Get your application in today for this sweet girl!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Dingo, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment.

A little coy at first, Tylen warmed up quickly, sharing his pretty smile. Showing little interest in our treats, he couldn't be coaxed to sit, until we returned him to his kennel where the manager clued us in. Seems Tylen knows sit, it just takes a bread stick! She also related an incident where a staff member was walking him, slipped and slid down a hill and he helped her get up. Loyal and sweet, we think Tylen will make a great companion. His adoption fee is $150 and helps cover his neuter, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

            "description": "Hi meet Ava,\n\nAva is a lovely 1-2 year old, Pit mix. She is deaf but is working on learning some commands, she is a smart and happy girl. Ava loves playing with other dogs and toys but is also an amazing snuggler. She is a happy go lucky girl and she makes a great companion. Ava is looking for a home that has patience and someone that is willing to learn with her or someone that has worked with deaf dogs before. She also needs a home where she is going to be the only dog.She wants a home that is committed to taking her to obedience classes while continuing her socialization. She needs a person/family who will provide her with a life of mental and physical stimulation while keeping her safe and happy. She is young, so she needs a plan if there are longer workdays, so she is not spending too much time in a crate.\n\nAva came to us after our rescue staff saw her on media platforms. She stole our heart and so we brought her to our rescue where we can find her the perfect family\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you. You can find our application at Lovejoyfoundation.orgYou MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application. We are a Southern California based rescue and do nothing adopt further than an hour from our headquarters in Inglewood, Ca. we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

I have this thing called a virtual foster mom and she likes to come to get me on Sunday mornings and take me for long runs because I tend to have a lot of energy. So someone that can help me get that energy out and that has a fenced-in yard would be amazing for me! \n\nNow let me tell you a little bit about my skills because they are amazing! I went to this place they call board and train and got to spend 30 days with them. This doesn't make me a bad dog, in fact, it makes me an amazing dog. I'm great on a leash (which makes my walks/runs super easy) and I will heel by your left side as long as you give me the command. I also know how to sit, down, stay, bed, short recall commands, leave it (great for those rabbits we see on our runs/walls) among other great skills like loving my people! \n\nSo let me tell you when I find people that I love they are my people. I just want to please them and make them happy. I need my person/persons to be strong leaders for me. I want to please them, but I need them to be my boss and set the boundaries with me. Once I know you mean business we will be good to go. So while I love humans I don't really love the 4 legged companions as much. I've learned skills at board and train that have helped me with that, but I do need to be the only dog in the home. I can be picky about the dogs that I choose to allow in my space. This is where needing a strong leader to just tell me to leave it when we meet other dogs and whatnot will come into play. My foster mom or the great team at the rescue are more than happy to speak to you more about this and answer any questions you may have about my temperament. \n\nYou see I'm lucky enough to be in this unique situation that the rescue has agreed to allow me to do something that is outside of their normal process called \"Foster to Adopt\". That is how much they believe in me and know how good I can do in the right home! I know, AMAZING right! \n\nDo you want to be my running or walking buddy? If yes please fill out an application for me today and maybe we can meet! \n\n* This dog is approved to live in Denver, however; BSL restrictions may apply in other cities/counties as applicable. Homeownership is required!\n\nEstimated DOB: 5/19/17\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He is a German Shepherd mix with an estimated birth date of 5/29/19. This breed is known to be very active, loyal, and yes even stubborn! Loki is a high energy dog and will require a home with a 6 ft. privacy fence. He can scale anything shorter. Loki is smart boy and knows a few basic commands. He is extremely loyal and has been failed by humans several times now that he does have some separation anxiety. With someone who is patient, Loki would make a great companion doggy. He would love to be the only dog in his home but will do well with others if properly introduced. He cannot be in a home with cats. He loves toys especially rope and squeaky toys. Loki is housebroken and knows how to use a dog door if needed. He will require an owner who is active and can give Loki daily exercise!\n\nTo adopt Loki, please complete an online adoption application at www.spcaeasttx.com under the \"adopt a dog\" tab!",
