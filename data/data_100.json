            "description": "Titan- 2 year old neutered male pit mix, 45 pounds, very playful and energetic, loves toys, good with some dogs, a bit timid at first but warns up quickly.\n\nTitan was traumatized when he was surrendered to the shelter back in May. This young insecure boy was beyond terrified and couldn't understand what had happened to his world. He's come out of his shell and is showing us what a nice boy he is. Titan was surrendered but no information about him was given to us. We believe he is house trained as he keeps his kennel clean and goes potty as soon as he is taken outside. He does well with some dogs- he doesn't seem to like pushy rude dogs. He is super playful and energetic. He will do zoomies forever and loves toys and running- he would do best in a home with a fenced in backyard. He knows sit and loves treats (he takes them ever so gently) so teaching him new tricks should be easy. He is a timid boy who was likely under socialized so it may take him a bit to warm up to new people, but once he does, he's fabulous. Titan would do best with an experienced owner willing to spend time training him and giving him proper exercise and stimulation. Are you looking for a running buddy? Hiking buddy? He may be the dog for you. Titan is at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 231 S Birdneck Rd, Virginia Beach, VA. You can call for an appointment to meet him 757-385-4444 or click on this link https://www.facebook.com/VBAnimalCareandAdoptionCenter/",

I was found as a stray and have slowly acclimated to living with a loving family and learning how to live like a king! My foster family has helped me learn how to feel safe and secure. As a result of their affection, it has allowed me to learn I would really love to be the only pet; I personally love to have all the love and attention all to myself! I would love to have a forever home on the countryside which would allow me to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and relax quietly; I am currently trained on an invisible fence and roam my foster familys property freely and safely. I am a pretty relaxed fella, but I am also very playful and love a good game of keep away in the yard!\n\nI am house trained and do not need to be crated when you leave the house since I am very well behaved when left alone. I am also leash trained and know basic commands! I truly love a good car ride resulting in a fun adventure and ending the day with a good cuddle! I would do best living in the countryside with a family willing to allow me to cuddle with them while I give them all the kisses!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the sweet, Big Man, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee $195\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older\nChildren must be 13 years old or older",

He was really scared upon arrival, but is warming up quickly to his new friends at the shelter. He is extra cute, extra slobbery, and extra desperate for a place to go. He is on the search for an adult only home, with experience with large breeds. Dough Boy is very shy, but also super sweet and affectionate with people he knows. He also likes other dogs, so YA!!!

They adopted Bandit from a local rescue when he was a puppy, but sadly he ended up with us. Now, Bandit is on the search for a new home with patient, loving, savvy, experienced owners. Bandit likes other dogs, and as per his previous owners, he is house trained and knows the commands \"paw\" and \"down\". His ideal home is an adult only household that has experience with guarding or possessive behavior. Bandit is also looking for a quiet, low traffic household due to him being nervous of stranger. Training or hiring a trainer is highly recommended to work on his stranger reactivity and guarding behavior.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more: Please call: 516-785-5220, visit us at: 3320 Beltagh Avenue, Wantagh NY 11793 or email us: adoption@tohmail.org",

Bella is an energetic momma who is looking for a companion to go on adventures. Bella loves to run, so if you are looking for a personal trainer, this is your girl. She is beautiful, strong, and full of life. Bella is suited for an active family and may do better with older children. She is looking for a family she can provide unconditional love and kisses. This fluffy lady is sure to shed, so get your lint rollers ready!\n\nWillene, founder of STARS received the SOS from another rescue agency looking for someone who could take in  7 adorable puppies and their momma. Bella is a strong momma who not only gave birth to 7 beautiful puppies but she also raised them in an enclosure with limited covering from the elements. They showed their true strength by surviving and thriving until STARS were able to rescue them! Now all 8 of them are in search of their furever families.\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this Momma. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a  few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.",

            "description": "*FOSTER OR FOSTER TO ADOPT *SEATTLE AREA \n\nCheech is a beautiful mixed breed with a story that will melt your heart. He is 5yrs old, Neutered, UTD and Microchipped. He weighs 46 lbs, although very strong he isn't a large dog. He is suited for home or condo living. He is house trained, leash trained and knows a few commands. We are looking for a foster/adopter for him and are willing to consider a foster to adopt. If interested in Cheech you must submit a application, meet him and be willing to build a relationship with him. He has waited a long time for a home and needs your commitment and love.\n\nCheech was surrendered thru our homeless program. Being homeless is hard on humans but its even harder on some of these dogs and Cheech bares the emotional scars of what he has been thru. Make no mistake he is a good boy that just needs a forever home. Please do not apply for him if your not committed to understanding his needs .Due to his previous life we are seeking a adult only home. Cheech would love to go for walks, hiking, camping, swimming and then go home and snuggle. He is good in the car. He needs an adult only home with no other pets or children. \n\nMinimum Adoption donation  is $350\n\nDisclaimer \nOften with rescue surrenders we are not told much about the dogs we take in and we want you to understand that they may have issues that we are unaware of. We do our very best to ensure we are placing them in homes they will fit in. They maybe afraid, not potty trained, or leash trained, may need time to adjust, give cuddles etc but one thing we know is that they are needing a home in which they can feel safe and loved and in return they will do the same.\n\nIf interested in adopting or fostering please message us seattledogs@hotmail.com\n\nSeattle Dogs/Seattle Dogs Homeless Program is a 501c3 that helps both homeless and surrendered dogs find loving homes. Adoption fees go to support vetting and anything left over transfers to another pet in need.",

            "description": "Cory is a very shy girl that needs either a foster or forever home. We believe she may have been abused. She is very scared of human hands and takes a while to warm up to anyone new. We are working with her daily and soon we will start working with her leash training. She is currently terrified of leashes. She gets along well with other dogs but we don't know about cats. She would do best in a home without children and with someone that is willing to work with her and show her the love she needs. She will be a big project for anyone interested in fostering or adopting her. If you are up for the challenge or have experience in working with dogs like her, please come by The Denham Springs Animal Shelter for more information. We will very picky of who will take her.\n Any potential adopters must complete an application. We will make decisions based on the needs of the dog, and vet references of the applicant.",

This lucky gal was accepted into the rescue and is looking for a new loving family. She is good with other dogs, friendly with people, and is a typical beagle. Tricolor Beagle. \n\nMore information to be updated when available - She will be vaccinated and spayed prior to transport. She is scheduled for transport from GA to PA on Feb 7th. Applications can be found at www.wagsrescue.com\n\nOur Adoption Area - WAGS RESCUE is based in BUCKS COUNTY. Therefore, a majority of our volunteers live in the Bucks County area. WAGS will consider adoption applications for people living in the BUCKS and MONTGOMERY areas. On a case by case basis (depending on distance and availability of our volunteers to do a home visit), we may consider applications in the PHILADELPHIA area as well as parts of CHESTER county.\n\nDue to a higher than normal volume of applications, we will not be doing any adoptions outside a 50-mile radius from Horsham Veterinary Hospital.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n\nPlease call Colleen @ 267-238-7892 or Susan @ 267-312-3372. To begin the adoption process please, please fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.

As a result he will do what he can to try and prevent being confined. Don\u2019t get us wrong though. He is NOT aggressive. He will try to get out of a room if he thinks you are going to leave him there. Rocky will need someone he can trust not to leave him alone constantly. He also needs work on his leash manners but is willing to learn. Surprising to us, Rocky does know \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d and will do both on command. If you are willing to help this diamond in the rough to be the best dog he can be then please let us know ASAP. We know Rocky is a fabulous boy who has been let down by people in the past. All he needs is someone to train him and show him the love and affection that he deserves. If you are willing to dedicate the time to this boy,",

However, I didn't have too much human interaction so it takes me a little while to warm up. Men kind of scare me but that is probably because I haven't met the right one yet. I love to curl up on my foster mum's lap now. I'm a really sweet guy and just need the\nright furever home to show me that I'm worth the love you have to share .\nJunco needs a home with another dog to help him feel comfortable. If you\nmight be the home for Junco, please email us at LLDogRescue@yahoo.com\nLocated in Overland Park KS (KC Metro) \n\nFence/enclosed patio required for most dogs. We check your vet reference and fence. Dogs are current on vaccinations, HW negative, micro chipped, dental if needed and spayed/neutered. Email lldogrescue@yahoo.com for quickest response.\n",

Although Cherokee doesn't get along with other dogs, she is well suited for a loving home where she is the only pet! Our affectionate and energetic girl loves to play and go on walks but it seems she can't go very far before tiring herself out. Cherokee is a few pounds overweight and would really benefit from an adopter who can take her out for daily exercise. Since coming to the shelter, our chonky girl has slimmed down dramatically but still has a bit to go. We know once she gets on a path to a healthy lifestyle she will enjoy her zoomies and won't be tired out. Cherokee loves you already and doesn't even know you- make an appointment to see our wonderfully friendly girl today!\nAHS Newark is holding adoptions and meet&greets by appointment ONLY!\nIf you come to the shelter without an appointment we will be not be able to accommodate you.\n973-824-7080",

She sat for a treat, which she accepted gently from our fingers. Annie enjoyed diving into our toy selection, eager to play fetch with the tennis ball. She was a bit guarded at her food bowl and will need a patient adopter willing to work with her on this issue. Annie would do best as the only dog in the household. She has a ton of love to give her forever mom or dad, so stop by to meet Annie.",

            "description": "LOCATION: SANCTUARY IN WILLITS, CA.\n\n$450 adoption fee\n\nLayla is very aware of her surroundings and excited by people, other dogs - and all kinds of stimulus - she wants to run, play, engage! She is a country girl through and through, she is nervous in urban surrounds. Layla is a sassy girl who is not afraid to let you know when she does not like something. She is afraid of things with wheels like skateboards, scooters, and bikes and can growl or bark as they pass, again, she is not a happy urban dweller. She is happier off leash than on and has good recall and great stamina!Layla is smart and motivated. She is much happier and more relaxed hiking on trails, running in fields, she'd likely love the beach. She is also cuddly and affectionate.\n\nLayla is a toughie, she is amazingly agile and athletic, fences rarely hold her, she can be determined to climb, to get out to follow or escape due to boredom - you will see her leap, climb and steady herself on top the fence and jump down.\n\nFOSTER NOTES 5/5/20 \"Layla is a super sweet and loving girl who loves pets and lots of snuggles. Layla is super smart and athletic. She has started to show her playful side as she's gotten more comfortable. She has a lot of energy and would love a lot of room to run and play. She is very smart and aware of her surroundings. Layla is an anxious girl and I've noticed can be a little timid around men, but as soon as she gets some calm pets and loves it's all over and she is melting. It has taken a week for her to feel more comfortable and calm with me. \n\nShe is very aware of her surroundings and was nervous about the city sounds at first. She can be spooked easily. Layla is a stubborn and sassy girl who is not afraid to let you know when she doesn't like something. She is afraid of things with wheels that go like skateboards, scooters, and bikes and can growl or bark as they pass. She has shown some leash aggression with other dogs but seems like she just wants to say hi and play.\n\nLayla is smart and motivated. She is more relaxed hiking on trails than walking around the city but is starting to feel more comfortable walking around town. With some consistency and trust her anxiety would decrease. I think with a little time she would strongly bond with her owner and be an amazing loyal companion.\" \n\n*Foster Notes* 4/4/20 \"Layla was very sweet and playful after a long walk. Gives very gentle kisses. Loves wrestling with people. She needs help on leash as she does pull when she shes dogs. Is fearful of trucks.\" \n\nLayla is an active, outgoing, athletic and super smart. Layla wants to please, she is charming, bright, engaged and ready to learn from dog savvy people with the time and devotion for a companion dog that is ready to roll!! She needs daily exercise. Ideally off-leash running - she is a great trail dog.\n\nShe is a super athletic champion in the making, and an excellent ranch dog running with four-wheel work vehicles, great recall, fast on her feet and super agile! Layla is full of intrigue, impulse (though her impulses can be controlled) she is enthusiastic, athletic and eager to take part, learn and love with outgoing people eager to have their dog be an important part of their life!\n\nLayla is smart and can find a way out of many fences or gates... so she needs a secure high fence or to be indoors or crated when her people aren't home, she would follow people down the driveway and away if not contained! She so wants to be included in all adventures and activities.\n\nLayla is alpha with other females but is fine with them out and about as long as there is space and action - on leash she likely would be more testy - she runs with a pack and the four-wheelers at the sanctuary as long as there is a direction, a mission, she is great - she will wrestle and play chase with the best of them! Loves water. Smiley happy girl.\n\nLayla is not great with livestock.\n\nLayla comes with a 20 day get acquainted period with her adoption, time to adjust to new surroundings. Please give time and patience to new adoptees, particularly dogs from the Milo Sanctuary. \n\n\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

Brenner has developed an extensive vocabulary of human words: he knows sit, stay, come, shake, paw, high five, down, out, walk, and treat. Want company on that trail run? This is your guy. Need someone to watch your yard while you watch your devices? Certified squirrel sentry over here. Curling up with some Netflix? Brenner's always up for snuggles and chill. He's a good-natured doggo who is most comfortable with adults and teenagers. Brenner could live with other respectful dogs and may coexist with confident cats. Contact his foster mom at 512-815-3397 with questions or to set up a time to meet this very good boy. I weigh approximately 69 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

They learned to hide from humans since they weren\u2019t sure about them.\n\nHangar is now 10 months old and the last of his siblings to be adopted! He is a beautiful and resilient young dog with a new leash on life! He has grown at blossomed at his foster home with other dogs his size who have been leaders to Hangar. It will be best for Hangar to have other dogs in his FURever home - dogs his size and larger only! \n\nHangar loves to play outside with his fur siblings and a fenced yard will be required to adopt Hangar.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Hangar, please apply at www.twotailzrescue.org!",

I cried, I waited, I looked around every day, but she was gone. I am so sad that I still cry out loud for her. But I now know I will have a new mommy one of these days.\n\nI want someone who treats me just like she did. You know, like a puppy. I want love and cuddles and fun and stuff to do. My trainer friend, Al, also makes it fun to pay attention to him.  He makes me wait for treats and listen to him. He made my lessons into games and showed me new things are not scary.\n\nMore about me!  I want to be the star of your life and do not want to share it with another pet!. Dogs often give me a look on walks that make me growl in return (they ALWAYS start it), and I have to admit that I do not know how to play with them,  As for cats, I think they're fun to chase. \n\nI would really like a fenced yard to run around in, because I can run fast!  Faster than you can, ha, ha.\n\nDid I tell you I hate crates!  Someone put me in a room with a closed door once and I panicked. Wouldn't you?  In fact, I might be very, very nervous for a few weeks once I move into my new home. My vet thought I'd have a happier life while awaiting adoption if I went on Prozac. It worked!  I can't be on it forever, I was told, but it works for now.\n\nOne of my human friends said I had to mention this too: you need to be prepared to work with my \"bull-headedness.\"  Oh, yeah, I can pretend to not hear you. That is so much fun!  But don't take offense, just take charge!  And hope to meet you soon.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPlease apply online through our website, www.dawg-rescue.org. If you have any questions, please email us first. Note that we do not accept electric fences and place dogs only in the DC metro area. If you wish to meet Brinx, we will require an application. Meetings occur from time to time, outside, at a generally convenient location and time. Thank you!",

She is approximately 2 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed& microchipped. \n\nThis beauty is searching for her forever. She is a little ball of energy that loves to please and love. Clementine is a very unique girl. She sometimes takes a bit to warm up to others, but is a very gentle girl. She loves playing outside with her foster parents and her toys. \n\nClementine is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. She would do best in a home with other dogs that are around her size, children who understand boundaries. She is very treat motivated and wanting to show her skill set off daily. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Clementine, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

If you are interested in meeting Koki, please contact salakbar87@gmail.com\n\nWhen Koki's owner moved, he left her in the care of a family member but he never came back to get her. :( Koki is currently living with 3 small children who she loves. She is a playful girl who is good in the car & who is housetrained. Koki does not seem to like other dogs and it is not known if she likes cats.\n\nKoki is an energetic girl who loves to meet new people. She is around 50 pounds and 5 years old. Can you give this beautiful girl the forever home she is looking for? All she wants is some people that she can love & who will love her in return! Is that too much for a girl to ask??",

I will do almost anything for a treat. I know quite a few human things like Sit, Come, Stay, and a few tricks, Shake, High-five, Play dead, Roll over. I currently hold the Olympic Gold Medals in sleeping, being a total homebody, playing Tug-of-War, patrolling for squirrels, peeing and pooping outside in my designated place \u2013 sorry to brag, but this is apparently important for humans.\n\nBelieve it or not, I\u2019m not perfect, so I need a human who will fall in love with me and believe I am worth your time and patience.\n\nMy perfect home would include, a quiet neighborhood, a home with a yard, where I can run, play, and do my business, adults \u2013 I haven\u2019t met kids, but I think I would do well with teenagers. No other pets in the home. Honestly, I\u2019ll give you so much love and cuddles, you won\u2019t need another pet! I know, I\u2019m bragging again! What can I say? And most of all: I need patient and loving humans who will\u2026Take their time with allowing me to adjust to my new place. Observe and learn about what makes me special. Continue my training. Introduce new experiences slowly and safely. Play with me. Pet and cuddle with me. Let me sleep as much as I want! Feed me lots of treats when I learn a new trick.\n\n[Lola is 3 years old and weighs 65 lbs.]\n\nIf you'd like to meet Lola, please contact Laurie: laurithomson@yahoo.com\n\nNote: This is a courtesy posting for our fellow rescuer, which means that even though this animal does not belong to our group, we are here to help those who need to find a home for their animals.

            "description": "I'm beautiful!Pinky Paisley was born around December 1, 2018 and weighs about 53 pounds. Pinky is with us because she was not working out in her last home and was hard to catch off leash. Greyhounds are sighthounds and are made to chase things because of this we will be looking for a home with a securely fenced yard. Pinky travels well in the car and walks nicely on a leash. Pinky has been wonderful with the other dogs and she does love to play chase and the girl is FAST! She doesn't seem to wrestle with the others, more of a chase back and forth style of play. She looks so silly when playing as her tail is so long with the white tip going every which way. We are going to recommend no cats or small dogs simply due to her breed and the general predisposition that there could be an issue. Pinky did not come off a racetrack. If your one to take walks with your dogs around the neighborhood she will certainly be stopping traffic with her gorgeous thick coat of brindle fur. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nHi everybody...My name is Moo - they said I had the markings of a baby cow so they gave me this cute name. I was born in July of 2019 so I am still a baby weighing in at 37 lbs. I just love people...I also love to cuddle and play with my toys. The family that surrendered me couldn't keep me since they were moving into an apartment and I really need a fenced in yard to run around in. My previous family spoke Spanish...they volunteers say I am bilingual too. I have a lot of love to give...I get along with other dogs and mature kids...I haven't learned yet not to jump...but that is something we can work on together during obedience training. We aren't sure about cats because I have never met one. I am UTD on vaccinations, spay/microchipped & on flea & heartworm preventative. I am housetrained but may need to get use to your schedule to make sure I don't have an accident. (I usually bark if I have to go)\n\nMoo's adoption fee is $300 - obedience training is required\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups. We understand with what is going on in the world that this may be a bit delayed. Once this quarantine and Isolation period is over just email us the completion certificate.\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt please fill out application at\n\nHeidisLegacyDogRescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nThank you for completing the application. We are all volunteers and short on time, we will contact you back only if we have more questions or your application is approved and you will be invited to meet the dog. We apologize for not being able to answer everyone back.\n\nFor more information contact Kelly.V@HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nDOGS are in Foster Homes. There is NO shelter.\n\n**Our companions MUST live in your home as part of your family.**We do not transport.\n\n**See our website for more information. www.HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nAll communication is thru email so please be patient with us. We are all volunteers and work full time jobs and have families of our own.\n\nIt takes anywhere between 3-7 days to process an application - the more complete the application the easier it is for us to process it. Please notify your vet that we will be contacting them and to release information to us.\n\nADOPTION PROCESS:\n\n1. The first step is to complete this application, HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com/adoption-application/\n\n***Everyone must submit an application - we only keep them on file for 1 month\n\n2. Application background check, vet check, etc\n\n3. Invitation thru email to meet the dog(s).\n\n4. Adoption Contract",

My foster mom tells me I am a pretty special girl so I am here to tell you a little about myself and hopefully you will think so too. I am a sweet 1.5-2-year-old golden girl who enjoys chewing on bones, playing with my four-legged foster siblings, snuggling up on the couch, giving kisses, hanging out with you while you make dinner, and laying by my foster mom\u2019s feet as she works during the day. I do not like to bark at anything, I know that you are only supposed to use the bathroom outside, and I do not need a kennel because I understand that I should not get into anything that is not mine. My four-legged foster siblings and I get along well and I like to play with them, especially when we can run around the yard together with a good squeaker toy. Watching them also helps me come out of my shell. I have been in rescue for a while, but I am still hopeful that my perfect home is searching for me. You see, my life before being rescued has left me with a few fears. My foster dad is very nice to me but unfortunately, I just get very nervous around men. I am trying really hard to overcome my fear and trust that they only want to love me, but I am just not there yet. I have bonded with my foster mom and when we get to have girl time I really come out of my shell and show my goofy side. I get so happy when she returns home from running errands! I smile big and jump around with my tail wagging. Knowing how happy I am when I can just hang with her, I think right now I would enjoy a home where my humans are all female. This will allow me to relax as I continue to work through my insecurities. If my forever family is reading this\u2026I just want you to know that although it may take me a few days to warm up to you, I promise if you are patient with me, I will be your new best friend.\nIf you would like to meet Bryn, please visit spotslaststop.org and fill out an application.",

We worked to try to secure rescue, but ultimately an individual took Pete home. They recently lost that home and Pete was not in the plans to go to the next location. \n\nPete is a super happy dog. He can still be energetic for his age ( 9-10 ish) but also enjoys a good nap in the sunshine. He is doing well with other dogs and cats. He requires a fenced yard and a strong/patient owner as he can be mouthy/nippish when excited and tug at the leash. He's very good about staying in a fence and is not destructive in the house.  He is house trained and crates well. He loves riding in a car or on a side by side. He shares a farm fence with a large pig and does not seem interested so farm friends are a possibility.\n\nWe were saddened to learn that Pete did not end up these last 8 years with the perfect life and circumstances, but he is ever smiling and hopeful that his last years will be spent as a loved family pet with a person who wants to give him what he's missed out on. \n\n\n\n",

I lived the first part of my life tied out on a chain so I am taking full advantage of smelling all the smells and seeing all the things. I\u2019m a big, dopey dude so small things, like kids, cats and small dogs, won\u2019t work for me. But I would love some new humans to call my own! I\u2019m not mean to other dogs, but again, distractions. My trainer thinks I would do best as any only pup. I\u2019m currently going through training, which will help me focus better and you get to be a part of everything I have learned. I\u2019m a good boy, but it\u2019s going to be an adjustment shacking up in an actual home. I\u2019m probably not best suited for a first time dog parent. However, if you have some experience with dogs, get in touch with my people. Ok, gotta go, some grass moved and I need to investigate. See you soooooon! \n\nAdoption fee: $200\n\nFor an application to adopt this pet, please visit our website! www.heavenafterhellrescue.org \nOnce approved to adopt, the adoption fee can be paid in cash or check.\n \nAdoption includes:\n \nSpay or neuter\nHeartworm test\nAge appropriate vaccines\nRabies\nBordetella\nAge appropriate wormer\nFlea Preventative\nHeartworm preventative\nMicrochip w/registration\n \nWe cannot hold animals more than 7 days after we receive a deposit as we don't want them to miss out on a forever home.\nAdopters are required to come to us to meet the pets.

Miss Sophie prefers a quiet retirement home in an adults only community. She was the star of her training class and cannot wait to wow her new companion with her repertoire of commands however, she would benefit from further training. This diamond in the ruff has been let down by humans in the worst ways but in true pitbull spirit Sophie holds no grudges! She is seeking a patient companion who wouldn't mind taking the time to get to know her down at the shelter, and develop a level of trust. Although she can be people selective and slow to trust, her love is UNCONDITIONAL. She loves to go for walks, bask in the sun, play with her toys and snuggle fiercely with her person. She loves to be the center of attention and would prefer not to share her companion with other animals. Sophie's smile and love of life is enough to light up any room.

This beautiful nugget of a dog is smart, affectionate, and great with teenagers (16 & up). Young, energetic, and people-oriented, she just wants to play the day away with her people in a yard or go walking on trails. Melody needs a firm guardian and correction for the jumping and nipping she does - small little grabs at clothes and occasionally that tiny little bit of a pinch on skin - she can be an exuberant jumping bean! We have worked with her but it needs to continue - trying to crop her wings and keep her grounded is a fete!\n\nMelody is not a dog park dog, she is an alpha dog, and a super physical player. She is best suited to being the only dog in a home and no cats or young children. She is happy to run and play in a yard; she loves treats and may do scent work - hide and seek.... She is best with stay at home folks with a big yard and as a running companion! This girl is a real go-getter like a big active lab crammed into a tidy little chunk of a body that's bursting at the seams!\n\nBecause of her active nature, Melody will do best in an environment with a tall, secure fence. Her above average intelligence has led her to become a bit of an escape artist and she is adept at climbing fences and opening doors (but not to run away... just to be with you!). However, these tendencies are fixable since Melody is a good listener who is eager to please and very treat motivated. Melody understands hand signals and voice commands, she will stop any undesirable behavior with correction, and making the effort, providing consistency and enough exercise she will want to please! \n\nIf you think you are ready for a go-getter-girl like Melody, come meet her at Milo today!\n\n**Melody's adoption fee is one half off! Adoption fee: $200. Melody comes with a 20 day get acquainted period with her adoption, time to adjust to her new surroundings. Please give time and patience to new adoptees, particularly dogs from the Milo Sanctuary.\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

            "description": "LOCATION: SANCTUARY IN WILLITS, CA.\n\nFoster notes: \"She is fearful, but never aggressive. She dislikes noise and activity. No training other than walking on leash. Does well w/ other dogs, is submissive, no resource guarding. She needs an adult-only home with someone to stay home with her, help her trust, it's a slow process.\"\n\nSanctuary Notes On Maggie: Maggie was the mom of the beautiful Pyr pups that were born here at the sanctuary and have since all found loving homes. Maggie came to us pregnant with her family members from the neglectful home described below. When she arrived to us with her seven family members in the back of a horse trailer she was very frightened and as we then discovered, almost full term with pups. It was not until she had her pups that we were able to pet her and show her that we meant her no harm. At no point when we were handling them did she ever try to stop us, which would have been understandable. Maggie still has along ways to go in building her confidence, but she is not an aggressive girl in the least and needs someone to help her adjust to being loved. Maggie is the most submissive of the females. We do not feel that she will ever get to the point where she is bounding around a dog park and jumping up and licking strangers, but we feel that she could certainly form a close bond with a special and patient person and live a happy and quiet life with them. Maggie is the smallest of the group, and for reasons unknown to us only has half of a tail. She is a gentle yet timid girl that is looking for her place in the world. \n\n\nGroup notes: Milo took in seven beautiful yet under-socialized Pyrenees that had been seized from a hoarding situation, but were then set for euthanasia due to lack of space at the shelter. We have been working with them to gain their trust as they were not raised as family members, and some are making great strides. Because of this, they are looking for very patient, understanding and rural homes that will continue to work with them to help them to realize their full potential. \n\n\n None of these dogs have ever bitten anyone and even the most fearful will run and bark when scared or unsure of a situation rather than show outward aggression. They had not been raised walking on a leash and were living in a large fenced area together which they had never left and were used for breeding, cared for by a man with mental illness until seized by animal control for neglect. Because they were not raised with livestock ( and do show a prey drive towards cats) they would not be a good choice for someone looking to have them guard animals on a farm, and because they were not raised in a home, they do not understand commands etc, but they do prefer to go potty outside and are loving sleeping on cozy beds. They will follow direction when a routine is established and will go inside or out as a group when asked. They do love each other and will bound around and play, but we do not know how they would do with other dogs given that Pyrenees imprint with the animals that they are raised with and these guys can get worked up as a group when there is a dog unknown to them outside the fence, for this reason if there is another dog in the home their interactions would have to be closely monitored in order to make sure that they are a safe fit together. From what we have seen, they are open and excepting of puppies even if outside the family group, but again supervision would be key! \nIf you are willing and able to help one of these gorgeous dogs, please send applications to foster or adopt to sanctuary@milofoundation.org\n\n $200 adoption fee",

            "description": "LOCATION: SANCTUARY IN WILLITS, CA. \n\nShadow is an intense dog, a very loyal dog, active and well mannered in many ways, but has some behaviors that make him need a particular kind of home. He is best with a more predictable, calm lifestyle - though active, just not a lot of strangers coming and going. He protects and can be barky on leash, and has some fairly typical protective instincts in the home. \nShadow needs to feel safe and that his people are in control - but not controlling. He does NOT tolerate being grabbed or restrained, he needs space and a calm person/people and freedom of movement - small spaces and confinement do not suit him, nor the unexpected. He needs verbal commands and a dog savvy person, no kids, no novices and no people hugging or approaching him - he needs to approach.\n\nShadow is now at the Milo Sanctuary where he is considerably more relaxed and happy!\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

With daily play, she settles nicely in the house and will happily snuggle at your feet or on the sofa. She is a serious fetch dog, but also loves to play tug or wrestle with familiar dog friends. She responds to over 20 commands reliably and demonstrates serious focus during \"go find it nose games. She is crate-trained but also trustworthy left alone unsupervised and uncrated in the home. She adores the people in her life and is well-loved by most people who know her because she is so affectionate and bright.\n\n \n\nLuna must go to an all-adult home with a medium-large yard that can provide daily play since she is still nervous walking on leash in the suburbs and should not go to dog parks. She is very uncomfortable around children and needs slow introductions to men. That said, she has a long memory for who her friends are, and being in a group with her people and dog friends builds her confidence outside the house. She could do well in a home with a non-dominant dog and has lived well with dogs of varying sizes and energy levels.",

She originally came to Milo from the Stanislaus Shelter and was adopted by a lovely woman who did her best with her, but who also lived in the noisy city where Jupiter just could not get comfortable. She's currently residing at our sanctuary for a much needed break from our urban environment, but is still available for adoption. \n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.\n************************************\nLocation: Milo Sanctuary Willits CA\n\nThunder is good with people he knows but can be scared of strangers, so building his trust is important. Thunder was surrendered by the niece of her deceased uncle. It took quite some doing to find a group willing and able to save these dogs from going to the Animal Shelter. He seems to not do well with people, and prefer dogs.",

Fun girl, who is not all that keen on kids in the home, she is protective and not keen on a lot of visitors.\nHappy has come up to the Milo Sanctuary to chill out for a bit, as a kennel environment is too frustrating for her.

            "description": "LOCATION: SANCTUARY IN WILLITS, CA. \n\nKobe is new to Milo, one of three dogs surrendered by a woman whose uncle owned them and recently died. It took quite some doing to find a group willing and able to save these dogs from going to the Animal Shelter. \n\nHe doesn't really do well with people and seems to prefer other dogs. \nHe needs an adult-only home without a lot of people coming and going as he does have stranger danger. Dog-selective, no dog parks.\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

He would love a place with room to roam and massive amounts of exercise. \n\nHe LOVES to chase sticks and rubber toys. We had him for 3 years on 20 acres of forest, where he was an excellent watchdog. Now that we live and work in town, we find he can't be left outdoors. Our yard is too small and he escapes within minutes to roam the neighborhood, scaring the postal worker. \n\nTitan is not to be trusted around children. He dislikes affection and does not like people to bring their face near his. He is fine around cats, chickens and other pets. \nHis best talent is leaping and catching things in mid-air - he's quite gorgeous to watch and will play for hours. He also loves to swim, especially if it involves fetching.",

Protector, hustler, ranch keeper.... people friendly, but will guard most likely once he establishes his pack and terrain, at least he'll alert and make someone think twice. Not a dog for the faint of heart or inexperienced. \nSlick is male dominant and needs a low stimulation environment to succeed in living with another dog - but with space and a female dog he can get along.... Someone who lives in a rural situation who wants a smart, quick, alert, challenging companion - Here's SLICK!!\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

He would love a home where it's in a rural setting because Bazinga would love a home with land where he can run and do his zoomies. A city based home will not be ideal for him. Bazinga loves people, and would need to go to an adult only home with owners who can provide the appropriate training and socialization. Bazinga will need to be in a home where there aren't any cats, dogs and kids under the age of 18 as he can get over stimulated and be a bit much for some people. He does know his current name and has good recall. He walks well on leash with a harness as he is a strong boy! \n**My adoption fee is one half off! Adoption fee: $200.**\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog.

She is sensitive and elegant - and fast! She can sit, shake, and lay down. She loves to chew on her bone and play with her Kong. She can be a bit nippy and territorial. She interacts and plays with our small dog just fine. Pearl is crate trained and we use this method when we leave the house. She eats a grain free diet - typically Turkey and sweet potato. She hasn't done well with chicken in the past, seems to upset her stomach. Pearl definitely needs to be placed with someone who has a lot of property because she is high energy. Our family hopes she will find a good home. \nPotty trained. Territorial around my kids friends. Needs a loving home with lots of room to run and play.\" \n\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond.

            "description": "LOCATION: SANCTUARY IN WILLITS, CA.\n\nShiro likes to play with toys, and is very smart. He is a moderately high drive dog like most herding breeds and likes activity on his terms. He likes his walks but his insecurities keep him from being a dog park dog. He bonds heavily with a particular person and sometimes a particular dog - he is IN LOVE with the dog SNOW KITTY at the Milo Sanctuary, and would follow him anywhere. Shiro is wary of strangers but is very loyal to his people and for this reason he can be protective. He needs a very predictable, low stim. home to be successful. Training and building Shiro's confidence would be key to have Shiro flourish. \n\n *Previous Notes* 5/20/17 \"Shiro is a super mellow dog. He just loves to sleep all day when we are at work. He does not bark or chew anything up. He is potty and house trained and never has had an accident inside the house. He is so furry and soft and has stunningly beautiful blue eyes. Shiro loves to run around and play fetch and catch Frisbee when he is not cuddling next to you. He loves the outdoors but is not a super energetic dog. He will just sleep all day or go for a walk with you. He loves squeaky toys and will just collect them from around the house if you hide them. He is intelligent and treat motivated. He was able to learn how to sit and was learning how to stay in just a few training sessions. *Shiro has probably had a rough past. When the vet examined him, we found a pellet in his x-rays. It is probably from being shot. He bonds very well with women and is more skittish with males. He also tends to get scared of men and tries to guard his female guardian sometimes. He does not like strangers coming up to him and gets protective of his owners. He would do well with experienced owners. We are not sure how he does with kids - Milo suggests a home without children for a myriad of reasons due to his stranger danger. He is insecure and can react poorly when meeting new dogs, but usually settles in and is fine - but can take some work with him and a new dog to get past the initial snapping and jitters, running with his tail tucked. *He needs lots of love, affection, and discipline, which we were unable to provide with our busy lives.\" \n\n *Shiro is not a first time dog, nor a city dog. He has fairly severe stranger danger and a bite record, he has fear based aggression to dogs and people. He needs a predictable environment, and a buddy dog.

            "description": "LOCATION: SANCTUARY IN WILLITS, CA\n\nTaz is a whirling dervish of happiness! He actually is not likely a CAttledog - he has a very smooth coat, floppy ears, long, skinny tail, long legs. Energy and enthusiasm to spare! Fun dog for active people, he was originally fearful of men, but has come around (we have male staff) still likely a dog who will show stranger-danger response to some new men, and perhaps women entering his space or approaching his person when on leash - for this reason he really needs a confident and experienced dog handler/caregiver/companion so he knows he is not in charge - they are. He is a delight but needs a very experienced home.\n A running companion, training, consistency and lots of exercise this boy will make a great addition to the right home! Tall fences are a good idea as well! \n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

A mid-energy girl with classic beauty and bright shiny eyes, Chloe takes a bit of time to become comfortable. She walks well on a leash and likes to stay close to you; then her nervousness disappears as the shared adventure continues. After she relaxes, she\u2019ll give your hands lots of gentle kisses as she asks for some petting. Then her tail begins its non-stop wagging! Off leash in playgroups, Chloe becomes even more comfortable and happy and meets everyone nicely. She\u2019s looking for a calm, adults-only home and would enjoy the company of another dog.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Sporting beautiful markings on his face and body, Anton is a tender soul who needs a gentle hand and slow approach to adjust to new circumstances and new people. With time, his trust in you will only grow and his sweet nature will reveal itself. Once comfortable, this mid-energy fellow is sweet and calm, even during his bath.  Anton loves his walks, and he\u2019ll surely tell you all about how he can\u2019t wait for an adventure with you! With some further leash training, Anton will be walking like a pro in no time at all. He meets dogs well on and off-leash and seems comfortable being with them. With the right pup, he can even be playful!

He lets puppies climb all over him and is happy as long as you know his spot in the bed is half next to you half ontop of you. it you are having a bad day he will come seek you out for snuggles. His medical issues didnt stop after the HW was cleared. The rescue will be covering his medical for life.\n\nUpdate: Taco is done with HW treatment. Everything went great. No lasting issues.\n\nTaco was found in the middle of no where in southern Texas. He is heart worm posstive and about to start injection part of treatment. He LOVES people and will do nything to make his person happy. he is lerning dog socialization and was recently neutered so those bad boy habbits are going away. He is great with kids and has really enjoyed meeting all of the adopters that come and visit her, sitting in laps and being a baby\n\nDNA profile\nhttp://embk.me/jaco6?utm_campaign=cns_ref_dog_pub_profile&utm_medium=other&utm_source=embark\n",

Now we are working to find Daisy a cushy retirement home She is happiest when she is in your lap! Rather than sleeping in the kitchen or even outdoors on a pile of cushions (her choice when she first arrived), Daisy has begun sleeping in the dog bed right next to her humans and sometimes even giving them \"the look\" that gets her an invitation to join them in bed! The more time she spends living with a family, the more she blossoms. Her potty training skills are getting pretty good too. Daisy knows how to use a dog door and she walks very nicely on leash too. She is nice with all the strangers she meets and gets along great with the other small dogs in her foster home. Her teeth are clean and she is ready to fit right into her forever home and make some lucky humans very happy!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Petie is a 18 month old Pit bull- American Bulldog Mix. He is a 65 pound, beautiful brindle and white mix. His personality is a mix of couch potato with burst's of energy. He still has a little puppy energy in him and get's a little silly at times. He is crate trained and house trained. Petie is currently attending obedience classes twice a week and has made a lot of progress. He can sit, stay, lay down, shake and loose leash walk. It took him about a month to get used to his foster families' neighbors and boundaries. He now only barks occasionally. He does well with both male and female humans. He is still learning socialization skills with other dogs.\n\nPetie was rescued as a puppy and was brought into a home with an older pit bull. The older pit bull had issues with anxiety and the owners thought that another dog would help with the older dogs anxiety. The two dogs did well until Petie's size matched that of the older dog. The older dog became very aggressive toward Petie and the two dogs had to be constantly separated. As a result, Petie was crated for most of the day. Petie's owners decided to give him up so that he could have a more active, normal environment.\n\nPetie's foster parents have worked hard to continue Petie's training at home. He is very food modified and does best with a firm yet gentle approach and positive reinforcement. He is super food motivated. Petie's perfect home would be one with older kids (12+), no cats, and possibly one other female dog. As we mentioned above he has lived with dogs before but it would take a dedicated new owner to get him to where he is comfortable with another dog. Overall, Petie is a goofy young dog looking for a freash start with a great new Family!",

His jaw was broken and his head is misshapen from being hit with a very hard object, yet he survived. His jaw was surgically repaired, but remains misaligned and his head is adorably misshapen.\n\nHis injuries have long since healed, now we need to finish the job and heal his heart by finding him his forever family.   \n \nIn spite of his treatment and spending a great deal of his life in a wire crate, Ben has nothing but love to give to the humans around him.  His foster mom tells me he loves to do two things - eat and cuddle for hours on end with his human, he signals that he is truly content - by snoring.  \n\nBen is between 5-6 years old with personality to spare, and would prefer to have his human to himself.  He is in a home with an older child and does great with that but an adult only family would be ideal. \n\nHe would love to be your shotgun rider on car rides and will be waiting for you at the car in anticipation!  He comes with all the usual options - housebroken, crate trained, up to date on all vaccines and neutered. \n\nIf you have a soft spot on your couch and in your heart for this love bug - we'd love to hear from you, schedule a meet and greet and who knows, maybe Ben will choose you for his human!",

She requires an adopter that will be able manage both using holistic methods including Chinese herbs and keto diet. This is not optional.  We are very specific about the home we are looking for her to have.  We understand this may be a very narrow fit, and appreciate any support towards her care,\n\nMariah was a stray at a local shelter.  She presented with mammary tumors on both chains .  They have been removed but her biopsy shows that the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes.  Her prognosis is not good.  That being said we feel that with alternative methods we can manage her life and hopefully her heart may give out before cancer over takes her.    Mariah is a shy gal who take s a little time to warm up .  Once she does, she is very sweet.  She enjoys the outdoors but is likely to run like the wind and should be kept on a leash at all times.  She has neurological issues and may appear to be blind.  She can see, she simply looks off due to her issues.\n\nWe are volunteers who work full time.  If you have any inquiries we  will try to get back to you within 48 hours.  We require home visits, therefore we only adopt within the Chicago metro area.  If you would like to apply for Mariah, please email us at ResceuTailsAnimalWelfare@gmail.com",

However, I'm what my foster mom calls a high energy player. Not all dogs dig that kind of play, so if you adopt me you'll have to make sure I don't play too hard. However I do eventually adjust to the level my friends like. I'm still learning not to jump up on people. It's in excitement, I promise! I love all people including kids. Unfortunately, if they are small I might accidentally knock them over though so probably older kids would be best. I am great on leash, in the car, and I am crate trained. I'm still working on the house training and doing so much better but I'm not perfect.....yet! My foster mom says I'm about 95% there! I'm also fine with cats. Curious at first but then I just ignore them. Hurry up and apply to meet me!",

She has moments where she is feeling spunky and can be demanding and bark at you but it doesn\u2019t last long lol. She likes multiple short walks a day, she wants to pull at first but she\u2019s easy to work with and have her walk well on a leash. She LOVES to play fetch And she will initiate fetch with you by bringing you the toy. And if you ignore it, she picks it up and brings it closer to you I have a cup of coffee while I sit out back with her almost every morning and she just sits beside me or lies on her bed.  She loves having her chest rubbed and just being pet in general I don\u2019t say this often, but she\u2019s the kind of dog that could go to someone older. I don\u2019t recommend an active household because she just prefers a mellow energy.",

Dana is shy and will nip before she knows you, but  is happy to take treats, and affectionate once she warms up. Make sure you watch the video that came from the shelter; it is behavior we have seen at the rescue as well. Dana is easy,  incredibly confident and intelligent and very cool looking with a long strip of fur down her spine.  She stands to come out of her turtle shell and make someone a most interesting pet.  I wish someone special with dog savvy would step up for her.  I would love reports of her finally trusting totally.  She already is dancing and twirling when she hears our voices.  SMART smart dog!  What fun Dana will be...what a pity people are so unable to GIVE more to such cool dogs who just want people to care!!  You wont trip over Dana...she is brighter than most people..",

He ended up in the rescue because his new family worked long hours, and could not dedicate the time and love that he needed (they hated to see him so sad while they were away). He likes to go on his nightly walks with his new foster sister Maddy (beagle), and gets along well with foster sister Maddy (beagle) and also the cat (Brady). He also does fine with strangers and will let them pet him without issues. He especially loves older women! We are currently working on house training with him, but he does have some accidents. His foster home has a doggy door, but like a true dachshund, he's too short to reach it! Peanut loves to chase squeaky toy in the living room, and he happily sleeps in his crate at night (left open) in the bedroom.   He recently went to the dentist and got his teeth cleaned. Now he may have 7 less teeth, but what he left are now sparkly white and he no longer has bad breath. Peanut is a sweet senior dachshund who cannot wait to find his forever home!",

Ms. Callie is the very definition of the breed, Great Spirit, protective, intelligent, focused, athletic and totally dedicated to her family. This girl blew through our socialization and training modules with ease, reflecting great poise, strong desire to work and train, and super interactive skills with dogs. \n\nI do not believe that there is much that Callie cannot be trained to do and she can accomplish this with speed. If you have a background of working with and living with this breed you will do fine but Callie is not the dog for an inexperienced Belgian Malinois owner. Our girl has a great stride, superior grace, excellent body structure, solid presence and a super demeanor. \n\nPLEASE DO NOT CLICK THE SPONSOR ME, ADOPT ME OR CONTACT THIS ORGANIZATION. BUTTONS THOSE BUTTONS WERE CREATED BY PF AND RDV HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE THEY ARE GOING.\n\nRESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5013C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n\nOUR DOGS ARE MICRO-CHIPPED AND READY TO BE PART OF YOUR FAMILY TODAY!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE\nThese dogs deserve all of our attention, and in Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Orgainzation, we are committed to our adopters and our dogs equally. We offer full disclosure and hope to make the best matches possible. Please know our adoption fees never cover our expenses. We rely on the generosity of our adopters and supporters to help us help the dogs. \n\nOur rescue is only in the business of offering full disclosure to adopters, and expects and hopes to engage your questions and concerns fully. We owe it to the dogs we rescue and all the wonderful families/adopters who might consider welcoming our charges into their hearts and home. Our dogs are waiting for that ideal forever home where they will be cherished as deserving family members. It's sad these second chances are even necessary for these dogs, but we are committed to them and will devote the time and energy to their re-homing, and not just move them to save more dogs. We diligently and responsibly seek good matches, as we don't want to re-home the dog again. These animals have already endured more than they should have, and through no fault of their own. It behooves us to be honest and forthright, and we appreciate the same in return from applicants. It's that winning combination of reciprocal trust and respect that allows for successful placements to be made. Happy adopters translate to happy dogs, and that's our goal! \n\n\n",

            "description": "Madison came to us off death row with fellow Happiness Is pup Cash. They had been confiscated together and spent two months at the shelter before we rescued them. Incredibly fearful, scarred from mistreatment, and underweight from neglect, Madison was in pretty bad shape when she arrived. She also had to undergo minor surgery for mammary tumor removal when she was spayed. \n\nNow fully recovered, closer to her proper weight and living with a foster family, it's been wonderful to see this sweet girl come out of her shell and start enjoying life the way she deserves. She's been a lovely house-guest who's house-broken, respectful to property, and even mastered a few commands. She's definitely intelligent, treat motivated and eager to please. \n\nStill wary of strangers, Madison takes a little while to warm up to new people (especially men) but once she's comfortable, she loves to cuddle! Visitors to the house are usually the only thing that makes her bark. Most of the time, she's incredibly chill and loves to keep her family company and enjoy their affection. Belly rubs are her favorite and always produce the biggest smiles! Madison would likely thrive in a home where someone is normally around most of the time. She's also been great with her foster sisters who are both in elementary school and know how to behave around dogs. She needs to be an only fur child.\n\nShe travels well in the car and enjoys both short trips to run errands and adventures that are several hours away. She also loves to be outdoors and appreciates the convenience of being able to go in and out to explore as she pleases. She's not big on running around or playing fetch, and would actually prefer to lounge quietly in the morning sun or afternoon shade. A home with a yard would be ideal for Madison and a doggy door would be a dream (though not required). She's not shown any interest in the pool at her foster home. \n\nSince Madison was never properly socialized, she is definitely more selective about the dogs she would like to play with. It's also clear that she hasn't spent much time on a leash, though she does enjoy going for walks. She's been incredibly receptive to leash training and has already demonstrated dramatic improvements with her new collar. That said she will definitely need a family who's willing to continue her socialization skills and leash work.",

Unbelievable!! \n\nWe could not get these babies out of our minds so we are taking a leap and hoping that our amazing supporters and volunteers will help us save them! One of the 17-year-olds, was actually adopted which we hope is a great thing (although we told the pound to let us know if he's returned\nfor some reason).\n\nSo meet Harley!!! Harley is our 17-year-old little man that is just beyond cute and pretty spunky.\n\nHe is fine with other dogs and seems fairly healthy.\n\nPlease consider adopting!!!! Please complete an application on our website at www.scoutshonor.org.\n\nWe could also really use your help with funds as we do not have them to pull these guys, but could not leave them behind. You can donate on our website or Venmo at ScoutsHonor-Rescue",

He is active for a short time then naps the rest of the day! He is housetrained and a non-chewer! He absolutely LOVES to go for walks and explore the world. \nWe were told he lives with 4 cats and was perfectly fine with them. He also passed out cat test BUT he went on a trial run and wasn\u2019t good with their cat. So we are looking for a home with no cats or other dogs. Titan also can not live with young children. He just wants to get all the attention. \n\nTitan has been fully vetted. He is neutered, microchipped, vaccinations complete, heart worm tested (-) and Lyme tested. He came back with a low Lyme positive so he is currently being treated. This handsome guy is ready to meet his forever family! Adoption fee is $300 and includes 6 weeks of obedience training!!!\n\nPlease visit hope-rescue.org to read about our adoption process and complete our application application.",

From what I hear, I am one of the volunteers favorites at the rescue! Just like my other fellow GSDs at the rescue, I have lots of energy and would do well with an active family, without children or female dogs. Though, I get along with most male dogs given proper introduction.\nI am a cautious girl who takes time to warm-up to people, but once I trust you, look out, because youre in my circle forever! I do prefer female humans to males but can trust them over time.\nDo you love to train? Then I am your girl. I am a quick learner and love to play, so I can catch onto obedience in no time. I am currently working on my barrier reactivity with a trainer at EDCGSR. He is helping me be the best I can be! If youre looking for a dog who is protective and loving, then I am the girl for you! Due to my quick reactions I need someone with experience working with dogs like that and no children. I'd prefer a calm quiet house hold. I'm spayed, HW negative, microchipped and current on all vaccinations. Please contact EDCGSR and fill out an application to meet me.\nMinimum adoption donation: $300.00\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Cassidy, please copy and paste the link below\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoptions/personal-information?application_type=Adopt&pet_id=386716",

It might be best if I am your only dog because I was a stray on the streets and a nice man took me in but I would not be nice to his other dogs and so I had to come to the shelter.I had an eye problem and was taken to the vet. He found I had glaucoma in one of my eyes. It hurt really bad and so it was decided that my eye needed to be taken out for me to feel better and have a better life. Nothing slows me down even with only one eye. I love to run and play in the dog park here at the shelter and I love to climb to the top of the exercise platform in a flash.... ZOOM... I go and then ZOOM .... again. What fun I have. I would love a job on a farm or a ranch. If you have a big yard that would be great for me too. I just need a wonderful home for wonderful me. I am already neutered and have had my shots. If  you have fallen in love with me and want to adopt me you can not just come to the shelter because of this sickness. For now you will have to first call or email the shelter and tell them you want me. Yes, little ol' me. You will be sent an application for adoption and if approved you will then be given a time and date to come to the shelter to come finish the paper work and take me home to be with you. I Can't Wait.... I will be so happy...... Blue",

            "description": "Hi foster world! My name is Little Lady and I'm looking for a place to call home. I may be 11 yrs old but I'm still pretty spunky so don't let all the gray hair fool you! I love to be outside in the backyard either chilling on the grass chewing on my Kong or chasing balls. I enjoy going on walks and I am pretty good on a leash. \n\nI've lived in foster pretty and my foster mom was pretty impressed with my bag of tricks (sit, down, off, high five, shake and come) and how I go outside to go potty when she asks me to. I have excellent table manners and like to eat my dinner at the same time she is or chill in the living room. Oh and I love car rides! There's nothing better than having my ears flapping in the wind while I take in all the wonderful smells outside the window. I'm still learning a new daily routine and working on being kennel trained. I'm not super fond of it but I may come around with time. I like meeting other people and have only met adults so I'm not sure how I'd do with kids. I think I'd do best if I'm the only pet in the house but I'd be up to try some trainning to see if I can have a buddy around. \n\nI just got to go on a Dogs Day Out and here's what the nice volunteer said about me:\n\nMy name's Little Lady! I'm super sweet and I'd love to be your new best friend! Whether that's playing fetch (I'll even bring the ball all the way back!) or snuggling! I enjoy being with people, but I'm not overbearing like the way puppies can be! I can just be in the same room as you, and I'll be satisfied. I love toys! I'm only the spry age of eleven, and I've still got lots of love to give! You know, it's a myth that old dogs can't learn new tricks! I already know sit and shake, and I pick new things up real quick, so it shouldn't take long to teach me to be great on the leash or learn any new tricks, if you want to teach them! I don't like other dogs much. I hope I can find a new best friend, and someone can find a new best friend in me! \n\nOverall, I'm a big sweetheart and love having someone around all the time. I'm pretty independent and can keep myself busy for hrs chilling or chewing on toys. I'd love to meet you!\n\nI am currently in a foster home. Please email: foster@kcpetproject.org to meet me!",

I came to NWTLB from Mexico with a litter of puppies, I was such a good Momma dog that I even took care of two other orphaned pups like they were my own. Since weaning my babies, I've been taking the last few monthes at the rescue for some \"Me time\". I had a pretty rough start to life on the streets of Mexico, I was malnourished and pretty cut up, as a result, it took me some time to come out of my shell and start to trust the volunteers at the rescue, now I can't get enough of their kisses and cuddles. I do experience separation anxiety when apart from my humans, it also takes me some time to warm up to men. My foster Momma thinks the world of me and we have been working really hard with the help of a trainer to overcome some of my fears, but I will need an adopter who understands how important it is to be committed to continuing my training and who will give me the time to work through some of my issues. In return I promise to give you all my love and plenty of cuddles and kisses.\n\nMy ideal adopter is a human who works from home or who has flexibility with their job so they don't leave me alone for long periods of time, I also wouldn't mind a dog friend in the home too as that helps with my anxiety (but I can be a little choosy with my dog friends). I adore hiking and walk beautifully on a leash, I really need someone who is active and will take me with them on hikes and play times where I can explore with my human and build confidence.\n\nupdate: I've been going to doggie daycare and Fiesta Island and get glowing reviews. I am good with other dogs at the daycare and play nicely. At fiesta I am learning to swim, I like running with the other dogs after the ball. I've been left up to 4 hours with the other foster dogs and did fine. All I need is lots of exercise and love.\n\nIf you think this sounds like you, please fill out an application for me on NWTLB's website.\n\n1/24/21 6:30 PM",

Moses has a very focused outlook on life, and that focus is mainly on \"his person. Once you're his, you will be the focus of his every thought! We think Moses is a \"blended Malinois. What he is blended with, we're not exactly sure. There sure looks like there's some Shepherd in there. Moses is in the medium range, about knee height and 40-ish pounds. He is trim and sleek and has a metabolism most supermodels would kill for! It's rare, yet Moses can exhibit his athleticism by jumping over fences, so he will need a yard with a good fence. And while it's rare, when he does jump, it's has been to get to \"his person! Talk about loyalty! Moses is a \"prancer, with an animated gate that you must see to appreciate! He is rather dog selective, so being the only dog in the house may be the best fit for him, also no cats would probably be best.\n Moses will want ALL your attention! He can be ok with older kids. It will take time and effort to bond with Moses, and that's part of his appeal. Once accepted, there is no greater friend you could ask for. He will prance right by your side while you go exploring, or running, and he will be just as happy to lie by your feet as you binge on Netflix. If you are kind and patient, and seeking a life-long companion, Moses might be it.",

            "description": "Rue \n\nLocated in Dalton \n5 months ish\nLab mix \nDog friendly \nNo idea on cats\nOlder kids only due to special needs condition\nHas Cerebellar Hypoplasia\nDoing well with house training \nDoing \"OK\" with crate training \nCannot be vaccinated for at least 30 days then will need single vaccines and ONLY every 3 years\nSeverely food reactive to humans and dogs alike\nSensitive to noice\nTreat and toy reactive but this is getting better \n\"Clumsy\"\n\nVery mouthy\nImpossible to get photos of \nWeighs about 35-40lbs\n\nRue is on the search for a special family. Rue hasn't had a good start in life. This sweetie was found by a kind young woman as a small pup abandoned, likely dumped. She kept her for a short while and realized that Rue has some special needs which made the fact that she was dumped even more cruel as Rue couldn't possibly survive on her own. Rue has Cerebellar Hypoplasia. Rue is in many ways a typical lab mix puppy. She's fun, silly, rambunctious, playful, a chewer, a cuddler, and is doing well with house training. However she does all of this in what seems to be her own \"off balance\" way. She falls over a lot but gets right back up and carries on as if nothing happened. Rue has been like this her whole life and she doesn't know anything different. As we continue to work with her Rue has advanced in being able to stand still and sometimes does run in a straight line instead of wide circles. Rue is one of the happiest puppies ever and has no idea she's different, she plays with her fosters dogs of various sizes without issue. She doesn't really understand social cues so we always make sure to watch her and the other dogs to make sure none get too annoyed with her hahaha. \n\nUnfortunately Rue also had to fight for her food and due to her condition probably lost most of those fights so she is VERY reactive to food. We have been working with her on it and have ordered her a snuffle mat and a slow feeder bowl to hopefully help her to slow down when eating. Rue has a lot to tell you, and she's not shy, she has all the self confidence of any \"normal\" puppy, which is both heartwarming and something to watch because she would totally talk back to the wrong dog haha. Rue is epically hard to get photos of but we have been able to get some good ones! \n\nHer case of Cerebellar Hypoplasia is actually quite mild in comparison to dogs like HPPAW Maya who cannot walk on their own currently. Rue walks, runs, trots, gallops haha she's a tornado.\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\n $250.00 Adoption Fee \n(The $250.00 is considered a nonrefundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we).\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!\n\n by Sybil",

I am a Texas Dude but can be in your arms very quickly anywhere in the US. My foster mom says I'm a born explorer just like the soldier. Now if only I knew what a soldier was!! She also says I'm a fun loving guy with lots of energy! I love to play but even more than that I love giving hugs and kisses to my human! My foster mom says that if I'm patient and well behaved that I'll eventually get my very own furever home... oh my gosh I'm so excited so I'm trying my bestest to be good! Will you love me furever?? I sure hope so!!!\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you. 2/2/21 3:20 PM",

Gibbs is a giant goofball coming in at 113lbs.  He loves to play and is extremely athletic.  Since Gibbs is so strong, we are requiring a fenced in yard for him.  Gibbs loves to play with other dogs, but would require a female playmate who is as big and playful as he is.  We would not recommend cats since he has a high prey drive and no children in the home.  Gibbs is also your typical guard breed dog and likes to protect his space, so a family with experience in this is preferred.  If you are interested in making Gibbs apart of your family, you can complete an online application at the link below.  You must ensure it says \u201cthank you\u201d upon submission or else you have to scroll down and complete any sections in red.\n\nhttps://www.doghouseadoptions.org/adoption-application/",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\n\nMy name is Lila. I was rescued from a very bad situation in Detroit. I LOVE to cuddle, and my favorite activity is sleeping in the sun.\n\nI do get pretty anxious/scared around loud noises and other dogs due to my history, so a quiet home with no other dogs around would be best for me. I do take medications to help and they don't cost much maybe $20 a month or so. I am crate trained and can also be left out of my crate for long periods of time without getting into anything. I am also potty trained, pretty good on a leash, and I know how to sit. I currently live with a cat, but he bullies me a little... so I'm not sure how I feel about cats yet.\n\nI am a really sweet, lazy girl who is looking for someone who will cuddle me and give me lots of love because I wasn't treated very well in the past. If you are looking for a couch potato, I am your girl!\nLast Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

I just want to find my people that I can hang out with and spoil with kisses. I have lost over 10 pounds since I joined BBRH and would like a person that will keep taking me for daily walks so I can get down to my healthy weight. I really enjoy my walks and walk nicely on the leash, but I do get very excitable if I see other dogs, people and cars. I can be strong, so I will need my new friend to be a strong leader who can help me remember my manners and keep me safe. In return, I just might give them a break when I decide to stop and roll in the grass. Dont worry, though, I will get back up so we can continue our walk!\n\nI am quiet and a good girl in the house. I love to have comfy beds and blankets to sleep in, and toys to play with (but I like to remove the stuffing so please make sure I always have a backup). I always like to keep a toy handy so I can toss it around with joy when my foster mom gets home! I just want to follow her around and observe from a polite distance, to make sure everything is okay. I wont argue when its bedtime, and in the mornings, I like to do a little yoga and stretch out all my muscles. Bet you cant guess my favorite pose!\n\nI also LOVE to lick and take car rides. I am the snuggliest girl you will ever meet! Wanna give this 6-year-old hunk of love a chance?\n\nRhea is up to date on all vaccinations, HW neg, spayed, and $225 is her adoption fee. She is fostered in Omaha. If interested in adoptiing Rhea, please apply at www.bassetandbeagle.org/adoptionapplication/",

She was surrendered to a local shelter along with siblings from the same household and the dogs had been kept outdoor with little socialization.  Based on X-rays and a physical exam by our vet, Grizzly has a decreased range of motion in her hips and is also showing signs of spondylosis (arthritis in her spine) by the occasional dragging of her rear feet.  Anti-inflammatory medication is given daily to keep her comfortable.\n \n\t\tGrizzly is housebroken and uses a dog door.  She is crate trained and seems to find comfort in being in a crate.  As long as other dogs are along, Grizzly enjoys car rides.\n \n\t\tThis girl is very aloof and does not seek out people for attention, however she seems to enjoy lying nearby her person whenever she sits down.  She can be uncertain in new environments and with new people.  No young children as they scare her.  She enjoys being with other dogs of all sizes and therefore must go into a home with one or more other dogs.  Grizzly has moderate energy and is overall a calm, quiet girl.\n \n\t\tGrizzly walks well on leash and seems to enjoy her walks.  Her forever home must continue her low impact exercise and should appreciate Grizzly's aloof nature.\n \n\t\tCats and small critters unknown.\n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Meet perci a 16/17 Shitzu with a prolapsed anus/ blind and possibly deaf , his brother beau a 15/16 chi mix that was hit by a car years ago and the owners didn\u2019t have the money to heal so now it\u2019s a dead leg . His owner is old and in bad shape so he called us to take them in. We did, vet visit is Tuesday. If anyone has the heart to foster these babies please contact us. We can\u2019t give up on them but at this age, they should be in a home. Our facility can only comfort them as much as we can but we are not a home and our goal for all our rescues is for them to have a good home together. \nInstate applications only. \nPlease email rescue@mayte.com\nkim@maytesrescue.com",

After having a home for over 9 years Sampson landed back in a rural Virginia shelter due to the health of his adopter. While at the shelter the 2nd time, he suddenly became blind. Sampson has been diagnosed with SARDS, Sudden Acquired Retinal Degeneration. This is not a painful condition and there is no therapy for it.\n\nSampson is adjusting slowly to his lack of vision and will need a patient person to help him navigate in his new home. He loves to be outside so a secured fenced in area would be great and wide open indoor floor plan in his home would be beneficial for him, with limited stairs but Sampson might also be a great candidate for urban living, condo living or apartment living, he is a quiet dog and very good on lead!     Although  he does well with dogs, he might prefer being the only dog in the home.    This older guy has grabbed our hearts and with  a little guidance and vocal coaching he  will learn his new routine. \n\n He loves taking naps and being sprawled out on his bed!",

            "description": "Elroy~Namaste~ Elroy's Woof-Facts-Male, American Staffordshire Terrier/Bulldog/ French Bulldog-mix, 5 years old, 50 lbs.-Big personality-from silly antics to warm and fuzzies with his human-Best smile (teef)! -Crate-trained, housebroken, knows some commands, good house manners-Needs time to trust due to fear-based behaviors-then he steals your heart-Adult-only home required-Is more comfortable with women-At this time needs to be the only pet in the home-Walks well on leash; can display leash reactiveness Introduction to ElroyMy name is Elroy you can call me Bubs (that's my amateur wrestling alias, wink)! I say that because I have a BIG personality. Sometimes I'll show it by, starting with a happy wag of my tail, strategically throwing my body into a solo-suplex right onto the living room rug (WrestleMania-style)-all in preparation of getting a full-body rubdown from my foster mom, or sometimes it's just when I decide it's time for some zoomies. After acting as a class clown to gain the affections of my foster mom, I make sure to steal her heart even further with my good manners and gentleness. My foster mom will be the first to tell you that despite having some behavioral flaws (I mean, who's perfect?), I'm entirely manageable and an absolute delight. I do, however, require a patient, mature household who respects my space and understands that I need time to feel comfortable and to build trust. She'll also tell you that when she recently became my foster mom, after about an hour of giving me space, and following our first walk together, I completely broke out of my shell. I sit nicely while I wait for my food and am gentle when receiving treats. And when I wants me some lovins, I lightly rest my paw on her arm or leg to let her know. I am timid with new people so slow introductions are necessary for me to flourish. Some people get too close too quickly, so keeping me on a shorter leash, especially around small children, is important, as some people, and mostly kids, have no concept of personal space. I'm eager to learn and follow the direction of my human. While I prefer a quiet environment (I happen to partake in yoga activities, \"Namaste\"), I don't mind jamming to some trap music when my foster mom is in that groove. I'm an excellent supervisor of chores (don't even mind the vacuum), and recently, I've taken my supervisory chores outdoors and oversee the gardenscaping activities that are happening in our yard. I enjoy chewing on my Nylabone and playing with my rope toy. I must warn you, a good game of tug of war will throw me over the edge of excitement into full WrestleMania mode (or full zoomies)! BTW, I LOVE an evening ice cube and am very skilled at catching treats that are tossed my way. Elroy's BackgroundI was adopted several years ago through Rescue Haven Foundation (RHF). Sadly, I was returned, and RHF found that I am less trusting now due to things that I experienced in my prior home. However, I am currently getting all the TLC that I need and want. So my inner spirit is more apparent, and my soul is more at peace.Elroy's Typical Day in Foster HomeOur daily routine consists of a morning walk before breakfast. Although I am housebroken and have not been destructive in the home, I currently stay in a crate when my foster mom is out for the day, and I do great with that situation. As a matter of fact, some mornings after I've eaten, on my own, I go back in my crate to get some more rest. When my foster mom is home for the day, I'm mostly right by her side, wherever she is. And sometimes I rest my face right on her foot while she's working in her home office-feeling connected to her brings me peace and joy. We go for another walk later in the day or early evening. While I walk great on a leash, I can display reactiveness with some dogs, loud, large trucks, motorcycles, joggers and bicycles. I respond best when you can get ahead of it so I wanted to make you aware of this. Evenings, I have dinner, and then I'm pretty chill, mostly relaxing or vegging with my human. We go outside once more so I can do my business before bedtime, and then tomorrow, it's basically \"rinse and repeat\", same routine.Elroy's Forever HomeIf what you've read above has made your heart feel warm and fuzzy, RHF will gladly speak with you to answer any questions you may have and provide you with further information. RHF is also offering support from our positive-based training network to guide my new human(s) while I acclimate to my new home. We want to make sure I am happy and safe. I will surely become your BFF, provide silly antics to keep you amused, and show my gentleness to steal your heart. Please fill out an adoption application and ask for Elroy (you can also use my WrestleMania name, Bubs-RHF will know who you are asking about). I'll perform a solo-duplex in preparation of my full-body rub down! Just make sure you have an ice cube for my nightly treat. 1/28/21 2:54 PM",

Just left there all by myself.  I kept asking myself what could I have done that would have made my owner just leave me there?  I thought I was a good girl, but apparently they didn't think so.  I was so sad and scared there all alone.\n\nLuckily, the awesome people at Lucies got me and took me in under their wing, just as they do for so many doggies like me.  They have taken really good care of me!\n\nThey have trained me to be comfortable in a crate and also how to properly walk with a leash!  I am so smart now!!  I love to play with my K9 friends here.  We especially like tug-of-war and playing in the water.  It's awesome now since it's getting hot outside!\n\nI sure would love to meet you.  You're not going to miss out on meeting and owning a redhead, are you?  ;)\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "BONGO -15 months old as of 11/2020 - Heeler Mix - 48 lbs - High Active; Needs Experienced Home\n\nNot only is Bongo all good looks but like any good looking dude he has a lot of energy. Bongo is a boy's boy! He LOVES being outside. He's working on his leash manners - he's very eager to go on long walks. Bongo would do great in a high energy home. He's good with other dogs. He needs to be in a home with adults or older children due to his breed. Bongo is a good boy if he is getting enough exercise and stimulation but when he's bored his breed instinct to herd can kick in so he would not be suited for a household with younger children. Bongo will thrive in training as he is eager to please. He gets really excited and wants to meet everyone if he was on facebook he would be sending friend requests to everyone. Interested in adopting? Please go to www.socialteesnyc.org \n\nHis Foster Dad Says: Bongo is a delight and my favorite of all my fosters. He has personality for days and always does something to make me laugh or smile. He is not a city dog. Even with tons of exercise, the chaos of the city only amplifies the more wild parts of his personality. He needs a minimum of two and a half hours of physical activity every day and lots of stimulation at home. We've been working on establishing clear boundaries with him, and with the right motivation (treats and love), he will keep to them. He loves his peanut butter cong the most and will tire himself out playing tug of war with you until your arms fall off. When he's calm and relaxed, he'll curl up with you on the couch and cuddle for hours. And he has the softest ears! He is still puppyish and therefore he plays with his teeth, something we are working on with him daily. He is decent on a leash and selective about which dogs he wants to investigate and jump all over. We tend to avoid interactions with other dogs, as he is still learning to keep his cool around potential friends he passes on the street. He is willful in a good way and so smart that sometimes I feel like he understands me. We wake up together every morning and I sing him a song and cuddle for as long as I can. He loves this routine, so his forever family should be sure to sing to him all the time. I recently taught him the \"touch\" command and he learned it in two days. A true genius! \n\nWhat is a Heeler?: The Heeler is also known as the Australian Cattle Dog. They were originally bred for moving cattle over long distances. It's an energetic and intelligent dog designed to do lots of physical activity and complete tasks almost all day. This dog does really well with structured training and learns fast but can be a handful if not getting enough physical and mental exercise. It gets the name \"heeler\" because it nips at the heels of cattle to herd them, so they are often not great pets for homes with small children because their instincts sometimes kick in and cause them to \"herd\" the kids. They generally thrive outside of urban environments, but in the city those on the chiller end of the spectrum make great walking buddies and would excel at agility classes. \n\nWhat does owning this dog entail?: Lots of exercise and mental stimulation is a must. This dog is considered a working breed since their original purpose was to do a job. It's going to be very important to keep this pup busy both physically and mentally -- that includes a minimum of 90 minutes of outdoor time every day for this high energy dog. A perfect walking, hiking, and running buddy. We strongly recommend a basic training course to get a more solid feel for this pup's individual needs and how to best communicate with each other. A well trained dog is a happy dog.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

He knows basic commands and his foster family is working on leash training. \n\nHe is very energetic and a social boy who wants to greet everyone! He gets along great with other dogs, but doesn't realize his size! He's a little afraid of some of the cats in his foster home. He loves playing chase with other dogs. He's well behaved in the house.\n\nWe are looking for an active family for Jackson with possibly a dog buddy and no small children, as Jackson is an active, big boy. Jackson would do best with a fenced-in yard to play.\n\nJackson is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines,  heartworm negative, and has been started on a monthly flea and heartworm preventative..\n\nJackson's adoption fee is $200.00.   Animal Friends Society is a small 501(c)(3) group that uses adoption fees to care for the current and future fosters in our care and to continue our mission of spaying and neutering.\n\nFor more information on Jackson,  or to fill out an application, please visit animalfriendssociety@hotmail.com.",

He said she was a stray but was not able to care for her properly, thus a litter of unwanted pups! A pizza delivery guy alerted us to her plight and we came to help. She is very enthusiastic and active and loves to run! After she came to the rescue, she lived with Luke a 5 months old pup for a while and they loved to run and play. He has now been adopted. She is a great size- about 45 lbs and could be a great running partner. We think she could also be a great couch potato given some time. Her breed is a little unknown. She is small for a Boxer so we are thinking something smaller might be mixed in- maybe JR Terrier? We hope you will consider adding STAR to your family soon. She now walks on a leash and is learning some basic manners.\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

He\u2019s absolutely stunning, here\u2019s a message from his foster/previous owner: \n\n\u201cI rescued Obie One from the Alaska SPCA while I was living in Anchorage. I got him when he was a week and a half old! When I first got him, I bottle fed him every hour, even overnight! He grew from the 4 pounds and 6 ounces I got him at all the way up to almost 90lbs! I ended up needing to make the move to Massachusetts last summer. Obie was hit by a car almost immediately after I moved. He had a surgery to repair a radius-ulna fracture and has made a full recovery. He also was born with only one eye, but that doesn\u2019t bother him at all! He does very well without it and as of yet, requires no medical attention or extra care because of it.\nAs far as Obie\u2019s behavior, he can be a difficult pup. He has resource guarding problems, so if treats, food or water are around he needs to be the only dog to get to them. Due to this, we think it would be best if he was the only dog in the home. He does pull while on walks and he can be reactive to strangers walking by, especially men. He also doesn\u2019t get along with children unfortunately, plus he can jump when he gets excited.\u201d\n\nObie\u2018s ideal home will be pet free and kid free, preferably with a backyard as he\u2019s very high energy. His forever family would definitely have to be prepared for lots of walks and exercise, as well as training. He has learned the basics to training quite well, he\u2019s skilled with sit, stay, down, off, leave it, heel, etc. \nAs for Obie\u2019s personality, he\u2019s a total goof! He loves chasing his tail, and when he catches it he doesn\u2019t know what to do and keeps spinning! He\u2019s incredibly playful and attention seeking. He loves to fetch, wrestle, belly rubs, play tug of war...really anything that involves interacting with him. He always wants to be involved with what you\u2019re doing! \nIf you\u2019re looking for a big, goofy, loving husky mix and you\u2019re willing to work with him, Obie might be the perfect boy for you! He just needs to be understood for who he is, and as long as you work with his basic training he\u2019ll be a great dog! \n\nIf you have any questions on Obie, please feel free to email us! We have even more details and information on him, which we will gladly send to you if you're interested.\nIf you're interested in adopting Obie, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.safetails.org.",

HE NEEDS A HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS!!Meet Spike: Spike has been at the dog pound for quite awhile now patiently waiting. He looks so sad as you walk by the kennels. Just hoping someone will notice and fall in love with him. Been extra rough since the pound has been closed to the public. No dog walkers or even people to stop and say Hi! Spike is around 4 years old and was found as a stray. He really is a nice guy, but he just does not get along with other dogs. He will need to be the only dog in the home.Spike is not a Rose's Rescue dog. Spike may be met and adopted at the Portage Co Dog Warden's Shelter, 8120 Infirmary Rd, Ravenna Ohio. Since the shelter is still closed to the public you will need to give them a call to set up an appointment. 330-297-6924https://www.petfinder.com/dog/spike-155180-46381678/oh/ravenna/portage-county-dog-warden-shelter-oh184/",

Rusty is a smaller Saint, that still needs to put on more weight and will be approximately 85-90 pounds soon.  Rusty has been used as a breeding male and will no longer be used for that.  He is housetrained and will let you know when people are around that he does not know by barking.  He is a very gentle boy and easy to handle due to his size.  We believe him to be approximately 3 years old.  Rusty came to us with Nancy and in an ideal situation would love to stay together.  We have not introduced Rusty yet to other dogs, since he was just recently neutered.\n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5. This is due to the large size of Saint Bernards and the safety of your children. Our Saint Bernards are not aggressive or mean in any way, they can just knock down children easily. If you would like to visit our pups please contact St. Cloud's Rescue at www.stcloudsrescue.org or call 972-679-5319. The first step in adopting from St. Cloud's Rescue is to complete an application. The application may be found OUR WEBSITE at www.stcloudsrescue.org. Please click on the application process, complete and then email it. Once the application has been sent please call us to confirm that we have received it. St.Cloud's Rescue maintains the right to deny applications to anyone for any reason we see fit. St. Cloud Rescue is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization. St. Clouds Rescue requires new owners to purchase a one year supply of heartworm preventative from us, which is at cost. We require a home visit prior to all placements. All our dogs must be microchipped at a cost of $20.00. There is a $250.00 donation fee. All dogs adopted through St Clouds Rescue must be indoors.

We are diligently working on getting her healthy and putting additional weight on her.  She has had multiple litters of puppies over the years.  However, those days are over, since we got her spayed.  Nancy is approximately 3 years old.  She came to us with Rusty and both dogs are very dependent on each other.  Nancy will not be ready to go to a new home for at least a month due to her current health.  Everything that we are treating is fixable with lots of TLC, lots of good quality food and medications.  Nancy will be even more gorgeous once we have added weight to her skeleton.  If you are looking for all the benefits of a smaller saint that still has the saint temperament and personality, please consider Miss Nancy.\n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5.

I arrived at BDRR with a splint on and it was soon discovered that I had metal fragments from a bullet in my lower leg, carpus bone. The bullet severely damaged a number of my wrist bones as well. As a result I had surgery to fuse my lower leg. I have healed well from the leg surgery and have also finished my heart worm treatment. I would be happy to have my friends at the ranch explain heart worm disease and the importance of monthly prevention so that I don't ever get it again. Heart worms are awful, they made me feel so sick and if it was left un-treated I would have died. I am good some dogs after proper introduction. The nice people at the ranch are working with me to meet other nice dog friends. I am ready to go home to my forever family.",

She is healthy, happy, and ready for a family.\n\nThis 51 lb retired mama was well known in an area of West Virginia. She wandered about and got herself pregnant quite a few times. Everyone knew her as Katie, but no one seemed to know where she lived. She made her way to animal control, and that's where her new chapter began.\n\nKatie is shy and takes a bit to warm up to you, but she will make her way to your lap in no time. She is fine with men and women, but because she startles a little, we think a home with respectful children ages 12 and up would make her feel the most comfortable.\n\nKatie is learning basic commands and doesn't have much in the way of leash manners (after all, she knew a life of roaming free), but she is smart and eager to please. She is treat motivated, but she is really praise motivated. She smiles and wags when you ask her 'who's a good girl?!?' as if to respond 'I am! I'm a good girl!!'\n\nShe is crate trained and house broken and has played well with dogs her size. She has a hound for a boyfriend, but we think she'd be fine with males and females. She has not been tested with cats. Katie isn't too interested in toys and prefers to sniff and explore with her nose.\n\nKatie is up-to-date and her adoption fee is $350.",

I too can turn your frown upside down with my fun-loving, yet gentle nature. I am named after cheese, a mild yellow cheddar. I am not exactly yellow though, I am a golden bambi color with a dark chocolate dipped snooter. \u00a0\n\nI suppose you want some demuttgraphical type info about me. I am a boy dog and will get my neuter done soon. The ladies will send you the dogumentation that my neuter was done. I am a German Shepherd mix and will be a large boy, as of early June, I am 6 months old.\u00a0\n\nI am a smart, easy boy, so with training you will be able to turn me into blue cheese, very moldy, I mean like you can easily mold me into your heart\u2019s desire. I am already doing purty good on house-training. I sleep through the night in my crate. I go right into my crate without a fuss for my meal or treat. Food is a good muttivator for training me. \u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t been around kids yet, but Foster Mum thinks bigger kids would be better because when I play with my doggie friends I am a lively bouncey bundle of joy. When playing with my canine buds and I prance and leap into action just like a ribbit guy, how do you humans call them, oh yeah, frogs. So come on and kiss me, so you can make me your prince!\u00a0\n\nBasics:\nMale, will be large size, 6 months in June & getting neutered in June, up to date on vaccinations, up to date on heartworm prevention, crate trained, pretty much house trained doing well for his age, loves to play with other dogs, not cat tested, likely better with older kids due to energy level and potential size, energetic, happy, fun loving boy will be wonderful to train and mold into your dream dog.\nLink to Application:\nhttp://www.gsdrescuectx.com/adoption-application.html\n",

She came into our program after she was hit by a car on a busy road. Tilly most likely missed the important socialization window as a young pup and will need to continue working on these skills with her potential family.\n\nShe has a loving, silly, active personality that has blossomed from behavioral training at the Texas Dogfather and being at home with her foster. She is smart and eager to please. She is improving on her leash skills. She understands \u201cWait\u201d and \u201cLeave it\u201d which are essential to practice during walks to ignore other dogs, people, and other distractions. She has anxiety so she needs slow introductions to new people and situations to build trust and confidence. \n\nShe is house-trained, and crate-trained. Her ideal home would be a house with a backyard, and a family that will provide a structured environment. She can be easily excitable where she will jump and be mouthy so we cannot recommend a home with young children or cats. She would love a non-dominant dog sibling that can show her the ropes. As she continues to work on her manners and training, we think Tilly can be the best dog she can be with the right family.",

Luckily for her they were able to nurse her back to health.  Finally ready to find a forever home, the shelter asked us to take her while she found her family.\n\nLiberty loves other dogs and loves to play.  She is learning boundaries of when the dogs are done playing, because in her heart there is never too much playtime.  \n\nLiberty is in a house with cats, and small and big dogs.  She is inquisitive with cats, so a cat that is dog friendly and assertive would be best with her.\n\nLiberty is a very sweet girl, and would be a wonderful addition to a family.  We think someone with a very active family would be ideal, and fenced yard would be a bonus.   Liberty also thinks she is a lap dog and wants to love on her people which due to her size may be too much for small children because she wants to sit nd lay on them to snuggle!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Liberty please contact the Oswego County SPCA at 315-297-4900 or complete an application at www.oswegocountyspca.org",

            "description": "Eight year old Farley is the best and most perfect snuggler we know - he will lay on your lap for hours if you let him, and will snore like a freight train once he's fast asleep. He is looking for a home with a person to snuggle. Even though he has short hair, Farley absolutely loves to be brushed and will often be soothed to sleep while you do so. Farley has 3 fused vertebrae and some joint issues that affect his mobility and balance and he takes daily medicine to make life easier and more comfortable for him. He loves his daily walks but will need to go to a home that has no stairs, as stairs are a challenge for him due to his fused vertebrae. On a normal day, Farley will wake up and wait eagerly at the door for his morning walk. Farley has been working on his potty training and has certainly come a long way - he is now 75% potty trained and getting better every day. After his walk, he comes inside and sits patiently, waiting for his medicine to be mixed into his favorite can of Caesar's. After scarfing down his meds, he goes straight for his bowl of dry food. His after-breakfast routine consists of sleeping on his favorite toy, Mr.Caterpillar, playing with Mr.Caterpillar, and begging those who walk by him for treats. He especially appreciates all the belly rubs and behind the ear scratches he can get from those around him. Once it reaches 5 PM, he takes his evening medicine, eats his dinner, and settles in for the night, dreaming of the perfect home that he just knows is out there waiting for him. Farley came to us lost and alone in March 2020 and would love to find a home and a family who promises to be his snuggle place forever. Although is he a gentle soul, he needs a home with no small kids or other animals - it's just that he can get spooked when someone comes up on him fast and can lose balance and slip or fall around others. Do you know anyone looking for a gentle and loving companion? He is wonderful. His meds cost about $120/month and the first six months will be sponsored by Susies Senior Dogs, a non-profit that promotes Senior Dogs, like Farley, and helps them find homes.",

            "description": "Meet Zodiac, empty nester looking for her furever home. Zodiac had a litter of nine adorable puppies in April and after being an amazing mom her pups have left the nest and she is ready to be the center of her furever families attention. \n\nZodiac is a Catahoula around 2-3 years old originally from Louisiana. She is small only around 40 lbs and needs to gain a few pounds. The best description of Zodiac\u2019s personality is \u201ccat like\u201d she can be a little unsure at first but once she trusts you she loves to curl up with you and be petted. She is completely house trained and does not need to be kept in a crate. She is both dog and cat friendly, however we recommend a home with children ages 12 and up. \n\nZodiac came in as a stray and presents as if someone was not kind to her in her past life, however she is submissive and very gentle. Zodiac\u2019s ideal adopter would be female. She can be very uncomfortable around men. Someone looking for a quite, gentel, loving dog, and a physical fenced in back yard is a requirement for her. \n\nZodiac does have a heart murmur that is treated with daily medication. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

            "description": "Nala is a Vizsla mix, born May 2018. She loves to be around people, even strangers. She is a smiley girl and wags her behind almost as much as her tail! Nala may not be entertained by fetch, but loves to play tug-of-war. She knows many common commands including sit, lay down, stay, shake, come, jump, and down. She is not a fan of the kennel and her foster family no longer kennels her when they leave for work. However, she will go to her kennel, even if not enthusiastically. Her favorite activities are long walks and cuddles on the couch. She is a great running partner, because she never gets tired and might even help you go faster. While she tugs initially, by the end of a long walk she will be by your side. She would love someone that is physically active (running, hunting, etc.) or to have a play partner. Nala gets long with nearly every dog and cat that she has been introduced to. While she is a fan of wrestling, and has a prominent bark, she quickly becomes submissive even to young dogs that havent learned how to play. Overall, she is a very sweet girl who listens to her foster. She would make a fantastic 2nd dog and play partner or happily join on outdoor excursions.\n\nNala can jump a 4-foot fence if a squirrel is on the other side! She will come back when called. However, for this reason, you should have a taller fence or keep her on a tie-down. \n\nOur official placement is that Nala should have no young children in her forever home, because she became very fearful of them in her previous home. Her current foster has not seen any fear or reactivity to children of any age, as training as seemed to help her greatly. In fact, if she gets out of the yard you will always find her accompanying the nearest family. However, to best set up Nala for a bright future, we will only consider adopters with no young children.\n\nAny potential adopter of Nala's will be required to speak to our trainer prior to adoption and have a minimum of one training session prior to adoption. If you have any questions about Nala, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on our website or on our Facebook! She is such a sweet girl!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Nala is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

I was rescued from a shelter where I was picked up wandering the  streets of south Texas. So glad to be safe and out of there.  I\u2019m pretty  much a happy guy, but did have some \u201cissues\u201d so SRT hired a trainer to work with me so I can find my perfect home.  I\u2019m a quiet car rider and do well at the vet. I\u2019ve liked everyone I\u2019ve met so far and am Ok with  some dogs, but I really don\u2019t need a companion dog and would probably be best to be your one and only. I do  fine with grooming, except around my beard and eyes. It freaks me out  to see scissors around my eyes. I need an experienced dog owner and an all adult home.  Click the \u2018Adopt\u2019 tab, complete your adoption application and put me, Patches, as a dog of interest. My adoption fee is $300.\n.\nPlease visit our website at www.schnauzerrescuetexas.me to adopt or to see our other minis",

SHE WILL BE READY FOR ADOPTION IN JULY.<p>\n\nLESLIE is a friendly, 2-year-old, 45-pound Hound mix.\n\nShe's a good-natured and playful young dog who enjoys going for walks, receiving belly rubs, and playing outside.  Leslie is a delightful friend and companion and would be an excellent addition to any family!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Expressive. Sleeps in her kennel or on the couch/bed. Great house dog. No squirrel can get past her. \n\nShe is good with large siblings if introduced properly but isn't a fan of small dogs. Needs a large yard and would be a great companion for a single lady or active family. No treat can escape her snoot.\n\nLincoln is a beauty queen. She is the perfect dog. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Lincoln please email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com",

Not good with cats.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\n\nHandsome Nick is 5-6 years old, heartworm negative, crate/house trained, loves to go places in the car and thinks cats are tasty! (Ie. NO CATS).\n\nNicholas gets along with my big pack but has special rowdy playtime with my 3 yr old female sheppie! They run and play mouthy shepherd games. Nick walks nicely on leash. He LOVES to go for walks and prances (yes...he does!) around when I get his leash out!!\n\nNick is older as we said and recently has had a hard turn in his life road. It's etched all over his body and spirit. Nicholas came to GSRA because he was shoved into a shelters' overnight dropoff box, (ok get this) on Christmas eve night!! Hence the name Nicholas.\n\nI can tell by being with Nick that at SOME point, he had a good owner that loved him. But not recently. He's had a rough time of it lately. He had both ears badly infected, was not neutered and was VERY suspicious of people's hands near him.\n\nEnter GSRA, dum da da daaa!!! Like your favorite super hero who swoops in just before the worst is about to happen, they took Nick in! GSRA fixed his nasty, itching, hurting ears, neutered him, sent him to a trainer for his salty attitude and helped him remember a time when people's hands were \"GOOD\" and the brought head scratches, tummy tickles and BUTT RUBS! Not beatings and nasty shoves into boxes.\n\nNick got the help he needed and thanks to GSRA he HAS remembered that people are good to him! Nick is now a super sweet middle-aged gentleman, who adores his foster family (dogs & humans), loves to go in the car and meet new people. Nick's world has been opened up and he LOVES it!\n\nAs bad as Nick had it, as good as he is now, Nick needs a forever home to make his circle-of-life complete. Nick needs a walk or 2 daily and an owner who isn't afraid to go slow with him psychologically speaking. If you take the time to let him get to know you, as you get to know him, the sky is the limit to the love and kisses he will send your way! Nick has a long life ahead of him! Who wants to walk that road with him and blab about how lost this superb dog was before you got him? Nicholas is your guy...and he's waiting for you!\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

I am on a daily pain med for arthritis (unrelated to the buckshot) which keeps me very comfortable. I really love to be around people so would do best in a home with someone that is home often. I would also do best in a home with no other animals although have been loving playing with my new friend, Kenny!  I walk well on a leash with my harness and would love a home where I can be your best pal.  The shelter is closed to the general public, but I can be adopted by appointment with an approved application!!",

Cooper's an odd one, he has trust issues, isn't fond of men, doesn't like to leave the house or his yard where he feels safe. He's not big on car rides and he won't let strangers touch him. However, Cooper's a love bug, he's a great snuggler, he loves to play ball, he's completely house-trained, kennels for a treat the minute he's asked to, he loves every other dog he's ever met (except one), he knows sit and stay and he's very well mannered in the house and he's happy to lay out beside you sunning all day. Cooper likes water, loves sleeping in the bed ( he likes to spoon), and loves blueberries. \n\nCooper needs a specific home to suit his needs. A female only home is best, he's actually really good with kids over 8, even male kids. He needs a fenced yard and a patient family that will accept him for who he is.\n\nWhen a potential home first meets Cooper, they need to understand that he is going to react one of two ways (we have seen it repeatedly with potentials and some just don't listen to our don't-try-to-engage-him suggestion). If you try to pursue or engage him so you can touch him, he will react by anxious barking and snarling at you. If you ignore him like he's not even there, he will eventually become curious and seek you out. We are looking for someone willing to do the latter.\n\nCooper is fully vetted, microchipped, altered on flea and tick and heartworm prevention",

Please contact by above phone or email to apply to adopt.***\n\nHello! My name is Libby and I am the sweetest pup  ever!! \nQuick Facts:\no\tBreed:  American Staffordshire Terrier (Pit Bull)\no\tGender:  Spayed female\no\tAge:  8-9 years young!\no\tSize:  60 pounds o\u2019 love!\no\tGood with\u2026\no\tDogs?  Small ones!  See Cohabitation!!!\no\tCats?  Sorry, no!\no\tKids?  Yes!  12+ years\nHistory\nMy name is Libby!  I was a homeless and landed in a high-kill shelter in the south.  I was very underweight at 45 pounds (so hungry!), and was also heartworm positive.  Things were looking grim to say the least, but then miraculously, I was pulled by Rainbow of Hope Animal Rescue ROHAR) in Big Flats NY the very day before I was to have been euthanized?  ROHAR arranged for my heartworm treatment and transport to NY.  Unfortunately when I arrived, the woman who was to foster me could not do so, so now I\u2019m staying with the director of the rescue in her garage (she has another big dog that doesn\u2019t like me).    I\u2019m so sweet and totally ready to start a new life with a new person or family!\n\nPersonality\nI am truly the sweetest, friendliest, most affectionate and joyful dog you could ever hope to find!  It\u2019s bonkers (they tell me) how sweet, gentle and friendly I am, given how rough my past life must have been, but, I really am!  \n\n\nI LOVE people!!!!  When I see a person (e.g, if we are out on a leashed walk), I get so happy about the prospect of meeting them--my ears go up (\u201cLookee there!  A person, yippee!\u201d), my tail goes wag-wag-wag-wag-wag, and I turn on gobs of adorable charm so that the person can\u2019t help but to come over and say hello!   I quickly get the \u201cAwwww, she\u2019s so sweet\u201d response from the humans and then we both move in for the \u201csmushies.\u201d  It makes everyone laugh!  One of my many (many) endearing behaviors is that if a person comes over and kneels down next to me, I will often climb up, wrap my arms around them, give them a sweet hug and a kiss, and maybe bury my head in their chest!\n\nI'm also a little bit goofy, and sometimes a little clumsy (haha!), and though I might not be the brightest bulb, I promise you that I am the sweetest!  I\u2019m  learning the words \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d and am a natural lover because if you say \u201ccan I get a kiss?\u201d you will get one from me!  Believe it or not, I know the word \u201ckiss!\u201d\n\nOne of the coolest new things in my life is a Kong filled with treats and peanut butter!!   Unbelievable!  My current foster mom gives me one every single day!  I like almost all chew toys--soft furry ones and hard Nylabone types, and I especially like chewing on and playing with them when my person is nearby.  I do not run after/retrieve toys if you throw them though--I assume that if you threw it over there, that\u2019s where you want it to be!  Unexpected noises (like a toy whistle) kinda scare me.\n  \nI am very quiet in the back seat of a car.  Partly that\u2019s because I get a little off-balance when we turn or stop short, and I have to focus on trying not to fall over (haha, clumsy!)!  I mostly end up layng down quietly, it\u2019s really the best approach (but I have to rediscover this every time).  \n\nNow\u2014let\u2019s cover walks!  I like \u2018em slow and easy\u2026Don\u2019t rush me please!  I gotta smell everything along the way, and ohhhh I love walks along a brook or a stream (haha or IN the brook or the stream!) or in the woods.  Now that\u2019s heaven!  And uhhh, if we could avoid the rain, I would prefer that, I am not a fan of the rain one bit!  \n\nI am a bit of a goof in that if I should walk on your left to avoid a tree, I might wander to your right, and if you are trying to steer me to the right, I might try to \u201chelp\u201d by meandering left.  Hahaha, it cracks everyone up, they say I\u2019m a silly, goofy girl!  I don\u2019t need a walk every day so please don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t a walker.  I\u2019m just as good hanging in the fenced yard with you while you garden or sit on the porch! \n\nImportant for you to know that I am a bit \u201creactive\u201d (aka excited/stimulated) when passing by other dogs when out on leash.  If they are at a distance, it\u2019s really no issue at all, but if they are close, I can get amped up, and since letting \u201camped up\u201d dogs meet each other is unsafe, you should never introduce me to other dogs in this situation. Just keep us going, and if you can distract me with treats, I\u2019ll be very happy.   Because I am a little glitchy with large dogs and large females especially, I should never go to dog parks or with you when you go to visit your friends\u2019 houses who have dogs.  Ditto, when they come to visit you, please ask them to leave their dogs at home!\n\nI am very curious!  And not just about people\u2026about things like how grass smells!  I do like to eat grass (it\u2019s my \u201csalad course\u201d), which is perfectly fine as long as there is no fertilizer down.   I am very food motivated but despite that, I take treats very gently!   I am in my glory if I can be with my person. I so much want to find my next forever person.  Please, please come and meet me!  I want to love you all day long and share a life of joy and happiness with you!  \n\nCohabitation\nI love all people! \n\nI am fine with children but because of my size (ok, and my clumsiness) I probably should only live with children over the age of 12 so I don\u2019t accidentally fall over them or knock them down while I\u2019m trying to show them loving or if I get too excited.  \n\nMy current foster mom has a cocker spaniel, a dachshund, and a shiba inu/pitbull mix and while I initially got a little over-excited to meet them, (same reaction when I hear them barking in the house), now I don\u2019t really mind when they come out to see me in the garage.  But she also has a very large female dog, and she and I do not get along.  I would probably do best in a home as an only dog, or it may be possible for me to live with another smaller, mellow dog, but we certainly would have to meet first to be sure!   \n\nI am not good with cats (sorry!), so I need to be in a cat-free home.  \n\nFavorite Activities\nI love:\n1.\tBeing with my person or people!!\n2.\tMeeting new people and loving on them!\n3.\tMy Kong full of treats and peanut butter!\n4.\tMeeting new people and loving on them!\n5.\tMy Kong full of treats and peanut butter!\n6.\tHanging outside in the fenced yard, sleeping in the grass with my person on the deck with me!\n\nMedical\nI was positive for heartworms, and received the full (immiticide) treatment.  Wow.  That was tough!  It took months, involved some really painful injections in my spinal cord, and involved a lengthy recovery period.  But guess what?  I\u2019m done with all of that (as of March 2020)!  Post-treatment, it can take 6 or more months for follow-up tests to show \u201cnegative\u201d but since the overwhelming majority of dogs test negative after the full treatment that I got, I\u2019m looking forward to that clean bill of health in the fall!  I do have some residual lung inflammation from the heartworms, but the vets have me on some medicine that is helping with that!  \n\nI do have a little bit of a bad back, but it doesn\u2019t slow me down other than I need you to scooch under my butt to help me jump into the back seat of the car!  My little lumps/growths that I have are very solvable problems and are being taken care of fully now, and should leave me with no long-term effects.  I am spayed and fully vaccinated and a healthy and happy girl otherwise!\n\nSummary\nI know that if you meet me, you will fall in love with me.  I am classic pitty, sweet, loving, so oblivious to the prejudice that exists against me.  I will be kind.  I will be gentle.  I will love you!\n\n**Libby is not a CDR dog and has not been evaluated by CDR.

(Yay!!!!) \nIf you enjoy walking, jogging, hiking, or other outdoor activities, but think a buddy might make it that much more fun, Nyjah just might be your pooch. She's good on a leash, and would be delighted to accompany you on treks in the neighborhood or great outdoors.\n\nThis girl is good with kids, but is looking for a home where she can be the only pet (no other dogs or cats). She is fine with other dogs in a neutral space, but doesn't want to share her home or treasured items with other pups. \n\nNyjah is going to need a tall fence -- as you can see, she gets some height on that jump! She can be a little shy and fearful when meeting strangers, but she's a love once she knows you. With her beautiful brindle coat, pictures just don't do her justice. \n\nShe's located near Beloit, KS, but can be transported to the right home.

If on a leash, you tell him to leave it with a slight tug he'll listen. Chaco loves his stuffie and takes a really long time to put a hole in it. His stuffie is like his baby. He's like a puppy learning everything. Recently he's started nipping you in the butt. Funny but we're working with him on it. He's leash trained, crate trained, never has had an accident inside, and gets along so far with the female dogs for sure. Small dogs I feel like he's too rough with. I don't think he understands his weight and size. He lived his whole life neglected living on a chain so everything is very new to him. Now he's living in a kennel so it's time he gets outta here and ventures into the world.\n\nGet your applications in!\nhttps://www.causendogrescue.org/adoption-application.html \n\nWe only do meet and greets for approved applications.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.\n\nAll dogs will be Up-to-date on Shots, worming, Spayed/Neutered and Microchipped. \n\nIf you rent or own a home, we prefer you to have a fenced in yard. \nApartment living is also ok but prefer a fenced in area if close to the road.\nAll adults in the home will need to know they are getting a dog and will need to sign the adoption agreement.\nWe do not adopt to college students with multiple roommates. \nMilitary will need to provide a backup plan.\nWe require all pets in the home to be spay and/or neutered. Because too many dogs are being killed, due to there not being enough homes per dog in need. Only the lucky ones end up here.",

Because of that, I am best in a home with no small children. I might knock them over and not know it, but big kids would work out great! I do tend to jump when I get excited and it'd be great if my new adopter was willing to continue working on with me!\n\nCats are not my favorite and I will try to chase one if I see it. I don't really like small dogs either (because they remind me of cats), but medium and large dogs are ok. I like short walks around the neighborhood and short hikes are okay, as long as I am your main focus, I love attention! Even though I am 80 pounds, I will try to sit in your lap and get cozy. I really just want to find my person and lay beside them all day and have my belly rubbed! My foster mom puts me in my big crate when she goes to work and I'm okay with that. Especially because I get a treat! Let me know if you think you might be my person!\n\n*Diesel would do best with an experienced, strong adopter, he can tell if you are not a dog person and might try to take advantage of that....\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please visit our website for our adoption application, www.underdogaz.com or email info@underdogaz.com",

I\u2019m a 50-lb lap dog. I\u2019d love a home of my own with a family who will not mind me snuggling with them for movie time, giving me treats for being a good boy, and just loving me forever. Could that be you? I'd be happy being the main squeeze of the house, but would also do well with a nice dog friend. I'd love a quiet home with someone who can work with me on learning to trust strangers.\nIf you are interested in meeting Gremlin, please contact adopt@love-a-bull.org",

            "description": "Hiya! My name is Snoopy! Wanna hang out?? I'm looking for a new friend or two to chill with. And I need some help too...that maybe someone can help me with. At the advice of my doctor, I need to take some weight off, and walks are the best...maybe you can help with that?? I LOVE my walks. Cause you can sniff things and investigate stuff. I walk very nicely on my leash and don't pull at all. My house manners are great too, my goal is to only lift my leg outside. LOL.\n\nI came to Heartland as an 8 month old puppy and was recently returned after my owner couldn't keep me anymore. Don't get me wrong...I like my friends here at Heartland...but I would kinda like my own place...if ya know what I mean. :) I would like my own person or two to do stuff with like walks, playing, rides in the car, adventures or just hanging on the couch watching Netflix. Fun BFF stuff! \n\nSome things you should know about me...\n\n\n\tI'm handsome\n\tI'm sweet\n\tI give great kisses\n\tI'm available!\n\n\nSnoopy is great dog, looking for his forever home. Is your home the one? Snoopy does have a medication regimen to help him with anxiety. His anxiety does not make him destructive, his anxiety causes him to vomit and have diarrhea. We have worked with our vetting team and come up with a medication plan to help Snoopy. His monthly medication plan costs approximately $60. He is responding well and we believe in the right home environment and TLC, Snoopy will thrive. \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative ( puppies age 7 months and older) and microchipped. A dog's adoption fee is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

His mother was pregnant with him when she was confiscated in an animal control case. He lived there for the first TWO YEARS of his life while the court decided his fate. Thankfully the shelter got custody of him and his siblings. When word got out about their story, he was transferred out to Pit Sisters in Jacksonville where he completed his training through the TAILS program.\n\nHe\u2019s great with other dogs! He\u2019s shy at first with people but once he warms up he\u2019s such a sweetheart! (He is easily bribed with treats and tennis balls!)\n\nThis boy has not known life outside of a cage. But he\u2019s blossoming in one of our offices, just waiting on his chance for the life he deserves.\n\nPlease adopt Kane today! If you can\u2019t adopt, share his story and help him finally get a home of his very own.",

He loves to play with his toys with you or chew on his cow hoove. Duke doesn't really like being around other dogs, he wants you to himself, but he will tolerate one. We think that he was kept outdoors most of the time because he won't stay outside without you; he loves being in the house with you and his family. He enjoys going for car rides. Duke will just come up to you and lie next to your feet and hope to get some loving from you; he really is hoping to get his belly rubs. Duke is just starving for love and attention and he really deserves it because he is a great dog; we don't think that he got much of it before. He sleeps well in his crate and loves to sleep with you near your bed or in your bed. He is housetrained on the potty pads and always uses them, but he will also go outside using the doggy door. If you have children he would like them to be 10 years of age or older so that they won't be so rough on him. He doesn't like to be left at home all day alone, being alone for a few hours would be fine or a stay at home parent would be great for him. Duke was extremely heavy when we got him and he has lost a lot of weight, just playing in the backyard with his foster or the other dogs. He has started learning how to walk with a leash, but he needs a harness on him or he will pull the collar right over his neck. Duke is ready to go to his new home and get lots of love from you and in return you will get more love then you ever would want.\n\nSECURE FENCING REQUIRED FOR ALL OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.\n\nFor more information call (925) 473-4642.\n\nIf you are considering adopting a dog through HALO Here are some helpful hints:\n\nBring pictures of your yard to show secure fencing. Most of our dogs require a 6 foot fenced yard. Yards must be cleared of any fox tail weeds. The adoption donation is cash or check.\n\nWe will follow up on the dogs well-being within 30 days after the adoption to make sure that they are happy and thriving.\n\nWe do adopt small dogs to apartments or condo and need to see pictures of the patio or balcony area. If you rent, please bring copy of your lease to show you can have pets and any size restrictions.\n\nWe do not adopt to homes with children under the age of five (5) unless we know the history of the dog with young children. All Children MUST be present at adoption. If you own a dog and are looking for a friend please bring your dog with you so that they can be introduced to make sure that they will get along.",

We adopted Max out to a lovely lady in 2010 and he had a wonderful life with her but then she became very ill and couldn't take him with her. Max loves to play tug-a-war with his toy and he always wants to win. Max loves sleeping with you and will cuddle under the covers when he gets cold but he is also crate trained; just don't forget his baby blanket so that he can cover himself up. He is house trained on potty pads but prefers to go outside to do his business and knows how to use a doggy door. He gets along very well with the other small dogs and likes to play with them. Max just wants to be around you and love on you; he will chew on your hand a little to get your attention, but never hurts you. You tell him to go get his toy and he will. He enjoys chewing on his cow hoove when he is just lying around. Max would enjoy someone that will have time for him; take him for car rides and take him on his daily walks. He likes sunbathing for a little bit outside but doesn't want to be left outdoors all the time; Max wants and needs to be an indoor dog so he can feel wanted and loved. He NEEDS and would love a new home without SMALL CHILDREN or MEN full time, they make him very nervous and doesn't seem to like them; It could be because he was raised by a woman only and his foster home only has a woman in the house. He really is a lover and would love to go home with you. He promises to be devoted to you and love you more than you can love him back.\n\nSECURE FENCING REQUIRED FOR ALL OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.\n\nFor more information call (925) 473-4642.\n\nIf you are considering adopting a dog through HALO Here are some helpful hints:\n\nPlease bring pictures of your yard showing your fencing and yard and BRING any other dogs that you have to be introduced to make sure that they get along.

We quickly reclaimed him in order to find a family that is a better match for him. \n\nWe learned from his first family that Elliot loves older children (9 yrs. and up).  He is not as comfortable with toddlers.  He does well with cats and grew up alongside another dog (his brother Marley).\n\nElliot needs to be with his people the majority of the time and he needs daily exercise/healthy stimulation.  His former family had to spend significant periods of time away from him .  Elliot will benefit from socialization and some positive training.  \n\nElliot is a little shy at the moment, but is easily won over with loving attention, play, and treats.\n\nHe is neutered, fully vaccinated, and ready to go home today.  He has been house-trained.  You may visit Elliot by appointment at our shelter near San Luis, CO.  We practice safe COVID-19 protocols.\n\nIf interested, please email us: woof@slvaws.org",

Sometimes I can be very possessive of my owner and take it out on other dogs but I love all people! I may take a bit of time warming up to men as they have hurt me before but if you show me love I will show it right back. I am crate trained and love to do tricks for treats.

            "description": "Jenny is a two year, female, 11lb terrier mix.  Her coat is a bit scruffy.  She is absolutely gorgeous and once she trusts you, is an amazing dog.  Jenny has come a long way in three weeks.  Jenny was part of a cruelty confiscation for hoarding/neglect. Jenny was almost feral upon arrival.  She bounced around the cage like a wild animal lunging at anyone who came close to her. Jenny needed some time to calm down and realize she was safe.  She will be fearful when she gets adopted, but once she calms down, she is perfect. Jenny is not leash trained and definitely needs a secure fenced yard to start. This will come in time once she trusts you.  Jenny is currently afraid of the leash, but has really started to trust her foster mom.  Jenny gets along great with other dogs and cats.  She has learned to play with toys and loves running in the yard with her squeaky toys.  Unfortunately, she also loves to bring her squeaky toys to bed with her.  Jenny is well behaved, appears to be house trained (although we never guarantee this) and does not want to be the alpha dog in the house.  She is content spending quiet time with her human and when there are other dogs around, she is willing to share toys and food.  Whoever adopts this sweet girl needs to understand she was part of a cruelty case and she will take some time to settle in.  Leash training will come later, but the initial first few weeks need to be spent on building trust and being very patient.  It has got to be on Jenny\u2019s timeline, not yours.  We will only adopt this dog within a 50 mile radius of his current foster mom in Sarasota.  Adopting fearful dogs takes an abundance of patience.  People often become discouraged and will give up on the dog if they feel the dog is not making enough progress.  This results in the dog once again, being tossed around to different homes.  Our goal is to make the best selection for our dogs. Please remember, we will always have their best interest at heart. \n\nAdoption fee $400\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority! Please fill out an Adoption Application at https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/",

When he arrived, Vito had a prong collar and chain embedded in his neck (which had to be removed by our shelter vet).  He had been kept tethered.  Vito's injuries have now healed, so he is ready for his new beginning (which he so richly deserves).\n\nVito is super affectionate with humans, but needs a home as an only dog (and no cats, please).  He is a loving boy... a truly beautiful shepherd.  As you can see, he is in the process of shedding his winter fur.  We have been brushing him, so it won't be long before Vito is down to his sleek summer coat.  \n\nVito is available to be seen by appointment at our shelter near San Luis, CO.  We practice safe COVID-19 protocols.\n\nIf you are interested in this handsome, wonderful guy, please email us:  woof@slvaws.org",

Please apply to adopt Rocco at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt!\n\nRocco is a young at heart 13 year old Rat Terrier who weighs 9 lbs.\n\nHe is looking for a wonderful home to live out his golden hours as his elderly owners had to go into assisted living and couldn't bring him with them. He lived his entire life in the same home with three small dogs and a cat.\n\nThe vet says he is in great health for a dog his age. He is active and lively. He likes to follow his humans around and loves to sit right next to them on the couch. He also likes to sleep with them under the covers. He walks on a leash perfectly. He\u2019s mostly house-trained but does need to be reminded not to mark in a new home. He wears a belly band in his foster home right now and does well with keeping that on.\n\nRocco would love a home with a retired family where he could spend most of his day close to them - walking, sitting on the couch, enjoying the garden! He does tend to bark when left alone, so he would not be a great match to be left alone in an apartment for many hours.\n\nChildren should be at least 5 to be approved for adoption! Fill out an application at our website below to be considered for adoption. \n\nPlease apply directly at WWW.BIGDOGRESCUEPROJECT.ORG/Adopt.\n\nOur adoption fee of $450 includes age appropriate vaccinations, microchipping and transport expenses.",

            "description": "Rodney is a very young, possible 1-2 year old, male, 11lb terrier mix.  Looks like a mix of Doxi and Cavalier.  Rodney was part of a cruelty confiscation for hoarding/neglect.   Rodney is fearful, but curious.  It definitely takes him several days to warm up.  He is not leash trained and definitely needs a secure fenced yard to start.  Once he calms down (over a period of several days-week), he will follow you around and wag his tail.  Rodney gets along great with other dogs and cats. This picture was taken exactly one week in his foster home and today is the first day Rodney\u2019s foster mom can touch him.  Rodney is food driven, so if he thinks you have treats, you will definitely spark his attention.  Whoever gets this darling boy needs to understand this dog has been part of a cruelty case and it will take him time to warm up and act like a normal dog.  Leash training will come later, but the initial first few weeks need to be spent on building trust and being very patient.  It has got to be on Rodney\u2019s timeline, not yours.  We will only adopt this dog within a 50 mile radius of his current foster mom in Sarasota.  Adopting/fostering fearful dogs takes an abundance of patience.  People often become discouraged and will give up on the dog if they feel the dog is not making enough progress.  This results in the dog once again, but tossed around to different homes.  Our goal is to make the best selection for our dogs and please remember, we will always have their best interest at heart.  Rodney will require additional house training and again, learning to trust people.\n$100 refundable deposit required to assure Buster gets neutered at rescues expense.  Adoption fee $400\n\n\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

            "description": "***Chamelea is not a CDR dog and has not been evaluated by CDR. Willow\u2019s Wings Animal Sanctuary and Rescue at https://www.willowswings.org/ who will make all decisions regarding her adoption.***\n\nMUST HAVE A HARD FENCE (WOOD OR CHAIN LINK) TO APPLY!!!!\nCANNOT CONSIDER HOMES WITHOUT A FENCED YARD, OR HOMES THAT HAVE AN ELECTRIC/INVISIBLE FENCE!\n\n\nMy name is Chamelea and I was rescued from Thailand!\n\nQuick Facts:\no\tBreed: Shepherd mix\no\tGender: Female, spayed\no\tAge: 4 years old\no\tSize: 50 pounds\no\tGood with\u2026\no\tDogs? Not in the house!\no\tCats? No, sorry!\no\tKids? 13+\no\t\n\n\nHistory\nI have been through quite a bit in my 4 years! I landed in a very crowded shelter in Thailand, knowing there was something not right with my back legs. I struggled to get around and I was in a lot of pain. Thankfully some kind people stepped in and rescued me! They were wonderful to me! They gave a nice place to rest, and plenty of food and water but they realized that I needed more help with my injuries, so they contacted Willow from Willow\u2019s Wings Animal Sanctuary and she agreed to take me into her adoption sanctuary! I was put on a plane and flew half way around the world. Who knew that a shelter dog would end up as a world traveller!!!\nI landed in snowy New York where Willow and her fur friends welcomed me with open arms! They took me right away to the Cornell University Vet Hospital where a team of veterinarians discovered that my kneecaps were displaced. Ack! Big problem, but they promised me that they would make me good as new., which as you can imagine, was quite a relief to hear! It meant I would be able to do things I\u2019ve always dreamt of doing, like running and playing, and not being in pain all the time! I had two surgeries which meant an awful lot of recuperating time resting in my crate, but I didn\u2019t really mind, I knew it would be all worth it. My legs are all healed up now and I am as good as new! I can finally enjoy life to its fullest and no pain! There is only one thing missing\u2026\u2026 a home of my very own. But everyone promises me that they will find me a fabulous forever home sometime soon!!\nPersonality\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE belly rubs! I will happily roll on my back and enjoy belly rubs for as long as you would like to give them!!\nI really enjoy a good squeaky toy! I will also happily play with balls!\nI like to \u201ctalk.\u201d Some may misunderstand and think I am talking in Wookie or mistake it for grumbling or growling, but I promise you, that is how I talk, and I love communicating with you!\nWhen I want attention, I like to use my feet to get you to pet me. Haha! I am gentle about it, it\u2019s kind of adorable and hilarious I am told, it\u2019s my way of asking \u201cplease pet me, scratch me, love me!\u201d\nI have some random moments of silly playfulness, but in general I am pretty laid back and I am perfectly happy lounging around the house chilling!\nCurrently, some say I am a bit on the \u201cfluffy\u201d side (aka, a teensy bit overweight), but that\u2019s how it goes when you are recovering from major surgery and are forced to be in a crate for long periods of time (I may or may not have watched a lot of Price Is Right and enjoyed some snack foods during my recovery time!!). I have overheard some people talk about a diet and exercise plan. I\u2019m in, let\u2019s go! I love to go for walks!\nI enjoy going for leashed walks. I walk nicely with a martingale collar. My people tell me that I am secure wearing one of those. And I like the thought of being safe and secure. We won\u2019t be able to go for long walks due to my knee limitations, but I like short walks! I prefer to take walk in calm, peaceful places. Busy streets or parks are not really my thing, that would make me uncomfortable. And dog parks\u2026.oh my..no thank you, way too busy and too much going on!\nLet me tell you one very important thing about me. While I am very (very!) loving and affectionate to those whom I love and trust, I am still quite cautious and nervous when meeting new people and when in unfamiliar situations. And I very much prefer when things are calm and quiet. I would love to meet calm, patient, and understanding people that will allow me to shine at my own pace. It takes me time to become comfortable with new things. The very best thing you could do for me when meeting me would be to sit on the floor, and kind of ignore me (staring at me would make me nervous), and just give me time. Wait for me to come to you. Perhaps toss some yummy treats in my direction, but then just sit there and read a magazine and give me some time. When I do approach, move slowly, speak softly, and don\u2019t reach out toward me, just let me come to you while you stay where you are. And if I back away, please don\u2019t get discouraged, I\u2019m simply not ready yet. This may take some time, but please be patient with me\u2026 I promise you I am well worth it, and once I get to know you, I am the most lovely wonderful girl you could ever hope to find.\nMy rescue folks says I need a home with a securely fenced in yard and I would have to agree. I do like feeling safe and secure. I could play and explore with you in yard, that would be fun! Another fantastic way for us to bond!\nI should also mention\u2026 I am a bit of a celebrity! \u201cThe Dodo\u201d did a story on me. It\u2019s a lovely story about my journey up to this point. It has over 64,000 views on YouTube!! You should really take the time to check out my story, you can find it at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orsMz-fTR1w\nCohabitation\nI need a very special adopter. I am seeking calm, caring, understanding, positive, and patient people. Someone who is gentle and nurturing and patient and sweet. Experience with shy and cautious dogs would be a huge bonus. I would not do well with inexperienced people. Ideally I would love to find a home with a person or persons that have a calm, quiet, laid back lifestyle.\nI must be the only pet in your home.  I have tried sharing a home with other dogs and I cannot tolerate it after a while.  Even though I am the sweetest girl possible, I have actually gotten aggressive to other dogs if I have to share home space with them.  I am fine seeing other dogs when out walking, but I cannot be in a home or fenced yard with other dogs.  No dog parks for me please!\n I have never been around children. I hear they can be quite active and sometimes make lots of loud sounds and zip around, which isn\u2019t a fit for me. I like things calm and on the quieter side, so I feel that the best fit for me is home without children or high activity.\nCats you ask? Very sorry, I seem to like to chase, so probably would not work for me to live with cats.\nMedical\nI have had two major surgeries on my hind legs to repair my displaced kneecaps. My rescue mom and Cornell have all of my paperwork. They will be happy to share that with you. I get around like a champ now! I love short walks but should not do long walks/hikes and should not go jogging or do things that require jumping (like agility).\nFavorite things\no\tSqueaky toys!\no\tBalls!\no\tBelly rubs!\no\tEar scratches!\no\tWaving!\no\tTalking!\no\tShort walks!\no\tNapping in a cozy place!\no\tBasking in the sunshine!\nSummary\nI am such a very special girl and I have so much to offer. All I need is a little patience because I can be shy with new people and new situations, but once we have a chance to get to know each other, I will be the most loving, sweet, and loyal dog you have ever had. I\u2019ve been waiting so long for the right person. Come and meet me please!\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an online adoption application at Willow\u2019s Wings Animal Sanctuary and Rescue at https://www.willowswings.org/.\n\n",

            "description": "Dex is a beautiful 7 year old male Husky with ice blue eyes who is searching for a dog savvy home that will understand his Siberian tendencies. He is affectionate and is hoping for a forever home that enjoys leisurely walks and sofa snuggles in front of the TV . Dex needs to lose a few pounds so an adopter who is focused on a slow and steady healthy lifestyle would be ideal. Dex has exhibited some possessive tendencies towards indoor toys and treats. For this reason, we'll be looking for a home without children, and no pets, please. He is housebroken and trustworthy in the home. Dex is a happy, friendly guy otherwise and just needs a safe haven with some walks and love. If you're looking for a new friend to keep you warm this winter contact us for more information about this lovable Siberian teddy bear! \n\n\nWe provide adoption services to homes within a 100 mile radius of our West Chester, PA office. If you are outside of that area please contact a shelter or rescue group closer to your home. All of our dogs are spayed or neutered prior to adoption, microchipped, vaccinated, and evaluated in a private home. You will find details regarding our adoption policy, process, fee, and application on our website (www.arcticspiritrescue.org). Please be sure you meet the qualifications we have listed for the dog you would like to adopt. No exceptions are made regarding the dog's requirements and we take our time to find the perfect home.  No dogs are shown without an approved application. We do not have a kennel facility. All of our dogs are fostered and evaluated in experienced private homes.",

            "description": "Meet Remy! Born April 27, 2018, Remy is a male German shepherd searching for his forever home. Remy was not properly socialized by his previous owner and therefore has been in boarding/training for a couple of months at Mattox Dog Training Academy in Eltopia. Remy can take a while to warm up to new people and tends to prefer females. He needs proper introduction to new dogs. He would do well in a home either on his own or with a female dog similar in size. Remy will not be placed into a home with small dogs, cats, or kids under 12. We will require a 6 foot fence in his new home. Remy\u2019s adopter will need to be experienced and committed to continuing his training and will need to meet with his current trainer before being approved for adoption. Remy is an amazing dog who just needs the right home, if you think your home might be the perfect place for Remy, applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com.\n\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DO NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

I was dumped at ARFhouse by my \u201cfamily\u201d But that\u2019s okay, I love it here! \n\nI am a little shy at first; probably because of my past, but I warm up quickly and I am tons of fun!! I LOVE other dogs! I probably love dogs more than people, which isn\u2019t surprising, considering what I\u2019ve been through. I would do best in a home with another dog to give me confidence, and a fenced yard so I can run and play! I have so much love to give, if you\u2019ll give me a chance. \n\nThe fee to adopt Callie is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Callie, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Callie is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Callie,  please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Callie.",

They are very good dogs.  They kennel at night, are house trained, completely vetted and very quiet (until you leave the house and then they howl for 5 minutes). They need a fenced yard for them to be comfortable.  They have never been on a leash, but I am sure they would learn quickly. Bonnie is a very dominant female and needs to be kept separate from others.  Clyde will jump in if Bonnie makes any advances, so they must be introduced separately if you do have other dogs. Please think about giving this pair a retirement home.\nPlease email dogadoptions@SuffolkHumaneSociety.com for fastest response.\nYour email is very important to us. We will respond to your email as soon as possible.We are all volunteers, do not have a physical shelter,... all of our animals reside in foster homes.\n",

Chloe is timid when meeting new people, but once she warms up... she gives the *best* hugs. She doesn't mind joining you for a walk if you like, but she's just as happy snuggling up on the couch. She very rarely vocalizes. She's 50-55 lb, and doesn't have any known health problems. Chloe is looking for a home where she can be the only spoiled furbaby.\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label. Each dog in our rescue is in a loving foster home, where they can grow, play, and recover from their time spent on the streets or in a shelter. If you'd like to meet an adoptable dog, please fill out an application on our website, www.edcr.org. Because we are a foster home based rescue a completed adoption application is required to meet our adoptable dogs.",

            "description": "At the tender age of 7 years, Red\u2019s life as a lonely kenneled dog came to an end. He is now enjoying the life of a SWESR rescue who is learning the joys of living in a home and engaging his Setter instincts in a securely fenced yard. He loves to spend time outdoors focusing on squirrels and birds\n?\nRed\u2019s housetraining is a success! Although he\u2019s not at 100% yet, he\u2019s almost there. He has stopped resource guarding his food and his foster mom. If he has a particularly great bone, though, he may still growl at his canine housemates to preserve his treat. He is still cautious around new people, but is excited to see them and warms up to them fairly quickly.\n?\nRed is learning how to walk on a leash and has made significant progress on that skill. Red can never be off-leash outside of a fenced area because, like most English Setters, his instincts take over and his recall disappears. Although he has learned to appreciate his canine foster companions, he would be a good only dog as he doesn\u2019t need interaction with them. If he does meet new dogs, Red is very cautious and needs slow, controlled introductions to make sure he feel safe. He is not a candidate for a hunting home.\n?\nInside, Red is a classic couch potato. He loves a soft place to curl up and sleep. In his foster home, he has furniture privileges\u2014something he has learned to totally enjoy. Red needs a good-sized yard with a minimum 5-foot fence.\n?\nRed is somewhat of a loner, so would be fine as an only dog. Because of his background, he cannot be in a home with cats or small dogs. He also needs to be in an adult-only home, ideally one with a patient, experienced human who can continue to teach him the joys and expectations of life as a rescued dog.\n?\nRed is fully vetted and ready for adoption. He is in a foster home in Littleton, CO.\n\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/. Please call us at 214-997-3885 if you have any questions.",

Odin is a smart cookie who knows several commands and will pose picturesquely for all your Instagram photos. He's a 3 year old, meaty sweetheart weighing in at 75 lbs. Odin is strong, active, and playful and would do best in a home with bigger, respectful kiddos as your one and only pet. Odin will be a great buddy! \n\nOdin's adoption fee is $100 and includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip, deworming, heartworm test, 30 days of pet health insurance, and a free wellness exam. Apply online at inapl.org.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Odin, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Odin. \n\nOdin\nMale\nDOB: 7/30/2017\n75 lbs.",

I was in pretty rough shape when I came here but my foster mom had me all fixed up & I'm good as new now.I am deaf & I also have some vision issues so a home without steps & a solid fenced yard would be best for me. When I came in I had a mouth full of bad teeth & had to have most of them removed (22 to be exact). I am neutered & UTD on all my shots as well as 4dx negative. I am mostly housebroken but I do still have accidents (age related) so a belly band really works out well for me. I would just like a nice quiet home to spend my days in & a nice sunny spot to relax in.

            "description": "Please note the hound shown in this post is not available for adoption.\n\nWhy foster a Coonhound?\n\nGentle Jake's Coonhound Rescue does not have a shelter or physical location. All the dogs are placed in loving foster homes until they find a home of their own. Aside from providing a safe, loving and comfortable temporary home until an adoptive home can be found, foster homes live with the dog and therefore know the dog's personality. This knowledge is vital in determining the most suitable placement for rescued dogs, thereby ensure a successful adoption.\nFostering is very rewarding. You have the opportunity to directly impact the life a dog who needs a second chance. You get to see the changes, experience the growth and best of all, you get to save a life!\n\nWhat do I have to provide for my foster dog?\n\nGentle Jake's Coonhound Rescue covers expenses (vaccination, spaying/neutering) and if more extensive care is needed, we cover that too!\nWe ask that foster homes provide love, a safe environment, rules and boundaries, and some basic training (and housetraining if needed). We also ask that you transport the dog to their vet appointments.\n\nWhat about vacations?\n\nWe are pretty flexible; if you need to go away we can try to provide a temporary foster home or a kennel stay at our expense. We ask for as much notice as possible so that we can make appropriate arrangements. Some foster homes take their dogs with them, but it's up to you!\n\nHow long do dogs stay in foster care?\n\nThe average stay is about 1 to 3 months. Sometimes, dogs are adopted sooner than that and other times, it can take several months to find the best home. It's not usually possible to predict exactly how long a dog will be in foster care, but lots of great photos and an accurate description of the dog go a long way to finding them a good home. Sometimes we have some very special dogs who need care for extended periods while they recover from an injury that required surgery. Sometimes we have dogs that need a little extra training or help because they are really shy. We supply the resources to help these dogs, it's up to you if you want to help with these more complicated cases.\n\nHow many dogs can I foster?\n\nHow many do you feel you can take? Most people only foster one or two adults at a time. But for the most part, our fosters usually just take in one dog at a time.\n\nCan I choose a foster dog from website?\n\nIn most cases dogs on the website are already in foster homes. We will not move a dog to another foster home unless the dog is in a temporary situation.\nDogs available for fostering are posted on our Facebook page and Petfinder site. We provide as much information as possible about the dog and photos. We also ask you what age, energy level, etc. you would prefer to foster (size, age, and training) and will contact you when we have a match. Usually it doesn't take too long!\n\nWhat if I want to adopt my foster dog?\n\nUnless we're in the middle of approving the adoption of your foster dog, you can adopt! One of the hardest parts of being a foster home is saying goodbye but it can be a good feeling as well. As the foster family, you are involved with deciding which family adopts your foster dog.\n\nHow do dogs get adopted?\n\nAnyone wishing to adopt a dog fills out the adoption application form and it is sent to our volunteer adoption coordinator. If the adoption coordinator thinks it's a good match for the dog, the application is sent to the foster home for their input. The foster home will talk with a potential adopter. References are contacts and finally a home visit is done to confirm information on the application. After everyone's happy with the new home, the applicant pays the adoption fee (and spay/neuter deposit, if applicable) and takes the dog home.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nWe are based out of Ontario, Canada. We have foster homes in Ontario and Quebec in Canada. We have foster homes in TN, KY, OH, IN and MI in the USA. We welcome foster application within these areas. If you happen to be outside of these locations please contact us prior to submitting your application.\n\nCompleting this application does not put the applicant under any obligation and does not guarantee that the applicant will receive a dog to foster. All information is kept strictly confidential. Please complete the application in full. By submitting this application, the applicant states that all information is true and accurate.\n\nREFERENCES\nPlease provide the names and contact information for at least 3 references who can speak to your fitness as a pet owner in general, and more specifically, as the owner of a medium-to-large sized dog. Please inform your references that we may be contacting them and give them permission to speak with us. If you currently own or have in the past five years owned a pet, please include your veterinarian as one of the references. PLEASE DO NOT LIST MORE THAN ONE FAMILY MEMBER OR OTHER RELATIVE AS A REFERENCE.\n\nIMPORTANT....\n\nOnce you have submitted your application you will get a confirmation message on your screen. If you do NOT get a confirmation, you must go back in and fill in any incomplete fields. Unless you get a confirmation message, we have not received your application.\n\nhttps://www.coonhoundrescue.ca/foster-application 1/31/21 7:15 PM",

I took him over to Clinic near by to get scanned for a chip and he was registered to Memphis Animal Services. They attempted to contact the owner and the owner never came forward. At the time MAS had just taken in a large amount of dogs from a near by hoarding case. They informed me that leaving Blu would put him higher of the euthanasia list due to them being full. There was no way I could leave him. I adopted him and he was staying at my facility until we closed for COVID19.  While we were closed My wonderful employee volunteered to foster him. He stayed with her for 3 months but she is unable to keep him due to her new apartment does not allow his breed. \nBlu is now back staying at our facility, looking for a forever home! \n\nHe is the sweetest boy, always eager to learn because he loves those treats, loves to cuddle on the couch, lives for long walks in the park and a great running partner! He\u2019s about 4-5 years old. Heart worm negative, neutered and up to date on his shots! but during his time with his foster we learned he is not good with other dogs nor cats and would be best in a home without!\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n*5 years old\n*Cate trained, prefers crate to sleep at night\n*House trained, very few accidents\n*Very very dogs selective; needs to be an only dog\n\n\n",

I can bark when first approached by new people, as I am unsure of your intentions. I do take treats but not from hands. I am very dog friendly. So, if you are looking for a best friend for your dog, I might just be it.

The person that found him said he growled at her baby, but was fine with her older child. This could be because he was scared of them being new or the people could be lying and it was originally their dog.\n\nUpdate: Lennox is a very energetic and playful dog, but good with our staff and volunteers. He is a bit of a ham. I would say no on small kids or babies just because of his energy level, but definitely older kids should be ok. He does know a few commands and loves to play with toys. He loves to hug you. He rides great in a car. He is an amazing dog that needs someone or a family that just wants one dog to spoil with a ton of attention. He has so much potential.",

            "description": "Kahlua is a Flat Coat Retriever.  We want her to be a forever foster. She is an older girl that deserves to live out her life in a home and not a shelter.  She came in with her brother. These two sweethearts came to us because of illness and financial hardship in their family.  Kahlua is vision impaired, but not blind. She is on meds for arthritis. She also has diabetes. She is on two insulin injections a day. Given she has diabetes, she drinks a lot of water and would need potty breaks at least every 3-4 during the day.  She is a sweet girl that still has a pup in her. Though partially blind, she still likes to play with her toys. She needs to be the only dog in the home. She requires at least a 4 foot fence.\n\nKahlua is 8 years old. Her current weight is around 75 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in Kahlua, please fill out an online application through our website.  \n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nThen meet her at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to fostering.",

He and his sister came to us because of illness and financial hardship in their family. He is on two insulin injections a day. Given he has diabetes, he drinks a lot of water and would need potty breaks at least every 3-4 during the day. He's a very affectionate and wants to be at your side.  He requires at least a 4 foot fence. \n\nRigsby is 8 years old. His current weight is around 85 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in Rigsby, please fill out an online application through our website.\n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nThen meet him at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to fostering.",

            "description": "Please note the hound shown in this post is not available for adoption.\n\nWhy foster a Coonhound?\n\nGentle Jake's Coonhound Rescue does not have a shelter or physical location. All the dogs are placed in loving foster homes until they find a home of their own. Aside from providing a safe, loving and comfortable temporary home until an adoptive home can be found, foster homes live with the dog and therefore know the dog's personality. This knowledge is vital in determining the most suitable placement for rescued dogs, thereby ensure a successful adoption.\nFostering is very rewarding. You have the opportunity to directly impact the life a dog who needs a second chance. You get to see the changes, experience the growth and best of all, you get to save a life!\n\nWhat do I have to provide for my foster dog?\n\nGentle Jake's Coonhound Rescue covers expenses (vaccination, spaying/neutering) and if more extensive care is needed, we cover that too!\nWe ask that foster homes provide love, a safe environment, rules and boundaries, and some basic training (and housetraining if needed). We also ask that you transport the dog to their vet appointments.\n\nWhat about vacations?\n\nWe are pretty flexible; if you need to go away we can try to provide a temporary foster home or a kennel stay at our expense. We ask for as much notice as possible so that we can make appropriate arrangements. Some foster homes take their dogs with them, but it's up to you!\n\nHow long do dogs stay in foster care?\n\nThe average stay is about 1 to 3 months. Sometimes, dogs are adopted sooner than that and other times, it can take several months to find the best home. It's not usually possible to predict exactly how long a dog will be in foster care, but lots of great photos and an accurate description of the dog go a long way to finding them a good home. Sometimes we have some very special dogs who need care for extended periods while they recover from an injury that required surgery. Sometimes we have dogs that need a little extra training or help because they are really shy. We supply the resources to help these dogs, it's up to you if you want to help with these more complicated cases.\n\nHow many dogs can I foster?\n\nHow many do you feel you can take? Most people only foster one or two adults at a time. But for the most part, our fosters usually just take in one dog at a time.\n\nCan I choose a foster dog from website?\n\nIn most cases dogs on the website are already in foster homes. We will not move a dog to another foster home unless the dog is in a temporary situation.\nDogs available for fostering are posted on our Facebook page and Petfinder site. We provide as much information as possible about the dog and photos. We also ask you what age, energy level, etc. you would prefer to foster (size, age, and training) and will contact you when we have a match. Usually it doesn't take too long!\n\nWhat if I want to adopt my foster dog?\n\nUnless we're in the middle of approving the adoption of your foster dog, you can adopt! One of the hardest parts of being a foster home is saying goodbye but it can be a good feeling as well. As the foster family, you are involved with deciding which family adopts your foster dog.\n\nHow do dogs get adopted?\n\nAnyone wishing to adopt a dog fills out the adoption application form and it is sent to our volunteer adoption coordinator. If the adoption coordinator thinks it's a good match for the dog, the application is sent to the foster home for their input. The foster home will talk with a potential adopter. References are contacts and finally a home visit is done to confirm information on the application. After everyone's happy with the new home, the applicant pays the adoption fee (and spay/neuter deposit, if applicable) and takes the dog home.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nWe are based out of Ontario, Canada. We have foster homes in Ontario and Quebec in Canada. We have foster homes in TN, KY, OH, IN and MI in the USA. We welcome foster application within these areas. If you happen to be outside of these locations please contact us prior to submitting your application.\n\nCompleting this application does not put the applicant under any obligation and does not guarantee that the applicant will receive a dog to foster. All information is kept strictly confidential. Please complete the application in full. By submitting this application, the applicant states that all information is true and accurate.\n\nREFERENCES\nPlease provide the names and contact information for at least 3 references who can speak to your fitness as a pet owner in general, and more specifically, as the owner of a medium-to-large sized dog. Please inform your references that we may be contacting them and give them permission to speak with us. If you currently own or have in the past five years owned a pet, please include your veterinarian as one of the references. PLEASE DO NOT LIST MORE THAN ONE FAMILY MEMBER OR OTHER RELATIVE AS A REFERENCE.\n\nIMPORTANT....\n\nOnce you have submitted your application you will get a confirmation message on your screen. If you do NOT get a confirmation, you must go back in and fill in any incomplete fields. Unless you get a confirmation message, we have not received your application.\n\nhttps://www.coonhoundrescue.ca/foster-application",

Contact Jacob Johnson and Marisa Abegg\n847-863-1239\ntwoj13@gmail.com\nmarisa.abegg@gmail.com if you can help! We have no further info. Located in La Jolla Village San Diego County, CA.\n\n\u201cMeet Stitch! He needs a new home due to poor adjustment to a human child entering his family. He's an approximately nine year-old bull terrier/pit mix, up to date with all his shots and no major medical issues. The result of being an aggressive chewer, he has chipped both canines and had one removed due to the root being exposed. Stitch is a sweet dog who LOVES people. Favorite activity is snuggling on the couch and he is a master at it \u2013 despite having no concept of personal space. His favorite spot is curled up next to or on top of any person who will tolerate it! Stitch enjoys lounging in the sun, needs a moderate amount of exercise to stave off the zoomies, and is very food motivated. He has moderate separation anxiety but is crate-trained and has adjusted very well to his \u201cden.\u201d When left out alone, he has been known to eat a shoe or get into the trash but does not exhibit other destructive behaviors such as chewing on furniture, trying to escape the house, etc. He previously lived with a two year-old child with no issues and has been great around humans of all ages until he started to interact with our toddler. What he needs in his new home:\n1) To be an only pet. Very reactive to all animals. Even tried to fight the only horse he ever met. He has lived with a Jack Russell since 2012 in a largely peaceful coexistence, although it required constant supervision and the breakup of a few scuffles.\n2) A home without young kids. He is ultimately being given up because he has been increasingly wary of our 1 year-old son, to the point of growling at him when he approaches or touches him. Great with adults and older kids (> ~6).\n3) An owner who is strong and experienced with dogs. Stitch does need regular exercise to stay calm and needs someone who can control a strong dog on the leash. Although he is usually well-behaved on leash, he is reactive to seeing other dogs nearby and can pull very hard.\u201d",

If not already spayed/neutered, there may be a short delay between when you select this pet and when they are ready to go home.\n\nBreed and age are determined based on observable physical traits. Actual lineage and birth date are rarely know.\n\nAdoption Fees:\nCats $50\nDogs 6 years and over $50\nDogs 6 months to 5 years $75\nPuppies under 6 months $100\n\nCome visit our pets Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-2pm.",

            "description": "\"Gerty\"...a quiet but affectionate girl who has the most expressive eyes which tell a story longing for love and a forever home. \n\nGerty originally arrived at the shelter and waited months to be chosen for adoption. Her lucky day finally came! She went to what we all thought would be her forever home. Sadly, after a few months, Gerty's adopter passed away. Returned to the shelter once again, Gerty was very depressed. Though her spirits are better now, she still waits for her special day to come again.\n\nGerty is 5 years old, 62 lbs., spayed and current on vaccinations. She is housebroken and knows her basic commands. When first meeting people, Gerty may be a bit reserved because she is low-key and likes to take her time before she opens up. Once she gets to know a person, she becomes her relaxed, friendly and silly self. Gerty has the cutest smile and wins everyones hearts. She is a medium energy girl who loves car rides, playing with toys, eating yummy treats. Gerty enjoys very leisurely walks, which she will determine the pace of! Her toys of choice are tennis balls and tug ropes. Peanuts butter Kongs are a favorite as well!\n\nGerty is best-suited for a quiet, single family home without lots of visitors as her devoted nature can lead her to guard her home and family. Children must be 14+ and dog-savvy. She needs to be the only pet in the home. \n\nGerty is a gentle, loyal girl who just wants a laid back family to love her. She may need patience to come out of her shell. Committed adopters who will give her time and space to adjust to her new home are on top of her wish list! \n\nWe kindly ask, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS regarding Gerty, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n*********************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 61.2lbs Age: 5yrs 5mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

She will need an adopter who is patient and can continue helping her thrive with special training for deaf dogs. When she feels safe she is a sweet girl, loves fetch, and loves mealtime. Quick movements can scare her so no children, please. She seems to be having difficulties with other dogs which may due to her inability to read body language of other dogs so it's best if she could be someone's one and only. She does know several hand commands but of course could always use more training to help her adjust. She is house and crate trained. She is fearful of the vet as a FYI. She is a sound sleeper as one may expect... So no worries about a scared dog during storms or fireworks! Apply to meet this super darling girl if you have what it takes to help her be her best!\n\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

He would need a patient adopter who wouldn't mind spending some time to get to know him. Once he trusts you, he is a real cuddle bug who loves to be pet and give kisses. Jay Jay loves to play with his toys (especially tennis balls) and usually has a hilarious goofy look on his face. Jay Jay loves his family but would do best in an adult only household with few visitors. Jay Jay is more than enough love for one family so he prefers not to share your attention with other canines or cats. Jay Jay also loves going for runs and playing in the water. He is very smart and loves to eat from puzzle toys. Come meet this handsome doggie today!",

Kodak is smart for his age and does not bark, dig or chew! However, he is still young so free roam while alone is not recommended for this fella. Unfortunately, Kodak had a run in with some neighborhood kiddos, which was a HUGE misunderstanding, but did result in a bite. Kodak was simply trying to protect his pack from what he perceived as a threat, however, it landed him in the local shelter. Prior to his incident, he lived with 6 children and another dog with NO issues! Kodak would love a family who understands his protective nature and is willing to manage the environment and train him to be the well-mannered gentleman he seeks to be. He loves car rides, snuggles and would enjoy another dog in the house to show him the ropes of true refinement. He can jump a 4 ft fence so a 6 ft privacy fence will be necessary. He dearly misses his humans and is sure to grow into a loveable lug...could it be with you?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "How does a dog become a dog? What prevents a dog from becoming a dog? What does it mean to become? To become is simply, to be. This is Nala. She is on a path to becoming. Nala is a 45lb 1 \u00bd lb female mixed-breed. She is spayed, vaccinated and micro-chipped. With people, Nala is fearful, skittish and shy . . . with other dogs, Nala is playful and puppy-like. Nala\u2019s anxiety is managed with medication, human patience and canine companionship. Nala\u2019s medication is 80 mg Clomicalm (a non-tranquilizing prescription anti-depressant), taken daily to calm her fears and reduce her flight risk. Nala forever home must have [no exceptions]: a minimum of one other playful dog living in the house, a fenced in yard . . . and a very patient and loving family\u2014that isn't looking for a snuggly dog. Nala is very low maintenance, she just wants to be left alone and allowed to play with and wear out [any/all the] dogs. After a long period of time earning her trust, Nala will snuggle and give kisses in the morning, play with you and her tennis ball in the yard, and let you massage her in bed. In the home Nala is well-behaved and non-destructive, so she has free run of the place. She's afraid of the open rooms, but she has become more comfortable in the kitchen. She's allowed to go in and out of her crate whenever she wants. She's afraid of the dog door, so she won't go out unless it is opened for her. Nala prefers to be outside on nice days. As long as she has a comfortable protected place to rest and her dog companion(s), she\u2019s all set. Her favorite outdoor game is chase. She will also chase birds out of the yard and hunt moles. Nala does not know basic commands; she is still focused on learning to become a dog. And, she will walk on a leash, but she is in flight mode so, she wears a harness and a martingale collar. Nala rarely barks. Except, when the other dogs go for a walk and she is left behind. Or, when she sees the neighbor\u2019s dog outside, she will bark to ask him to come play with her. Her foster mom says, \u201cNala LOVES dogs. She has played well with every other dog she\u2019s ever encountered: young dogs, old dogs, male dogs, female dogs . . . she just loves dogs and she just wants to play! She's a sweetheart. And, she will blossom in the right house. But, it will take time and patience . . . months or years, not weeks.\u201d Perhaps, you are motivated by the desire to make a difference in the life of a deserving dog? Perhaps, you are looking for the perfect playmate and companion for your dog(s)? Nala is on a path to becoming. If you walk beside Nala, there is no telling who you will become.\n\nTo adopt, please submit an application at this link: http://form.jotform.com/form/11880935459 or visit www.pottersangelsrescue.org to view additional adoptable dogs and for more information.

            "description": "Chance, born April 2018, is a Boxer/Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix who loves being active whether that means playing with his toys or playing fetch. As a matter of fact, Chance loves his toys so much that he rarely ever destroys them to find the squeaker! Walks are also high on his list of favorite past times, and he has NEVER been known to turn down a chance to go for a car ride. Chance also enjoys watching an occasional movie with his mom and dad and enjoys all the snuggles he gets. This smarty knows several basic commands and can easily learn more, especially when treats are involved. He gets along with submissive dogs that are his size. Chance is not destructive so there is no need for crating him. The perfect home for Chance will be with one or two adults who will love him as much as he loves them. Chance has a big bark when meeting new people, and he DOES take a while to warm up to new people. Because of this, he may need multiple meetings with potential adopters. Once Chance gets to know you and trusts you, this big marshmallow will be your best friend. He is the sweetest, most loyal boy, but it will take time to earn his trust.\n\nChance needs time to feel safe with new people. Interested adopters should expect a few meetings for Chance to get to know them. A trainer will be a part of the process to help Chance and his new owners work well together.\n\nIn addition, before applying to adopt Chance, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Chance is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Thor would enjoy an active household that gets him out and about but is not a hyper or super high energy dog.  A home with other dogs is preferred as he really enjoys playing with his doggy friends.  You can see him playing with a buddy in his video (Thor is the one with the green collar). \n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and we adopt to a 2.5 hour radius of zip code 21034.

Rover (tan) is around 2 years old and weighs approximately 42 pounds. They are quite bonded and the best of buds! ALASKA IS DEAF. But that doesn't slow her down one bit. Rover is her absolute best friend and he adores her. She follows him around and tries to mimic what he does. They are bunk buddies and do everything together. They LOVE to play together and even sleep with each other in a large crate. These bonded buddies love people and are very loyal to their family. They like to say hi to new people and are sociable with strangers. They do well with other dogs, given a proper introduction. However, this also means that they would not do well in dog parks/beaches. Rover has a prey instinct and would not do well around small animals. They would do well with children over 12 years of age. Both Alaska & Rover love treats and are food-motivated! They both really, really, really, love affection and will sit and snuggle patiently while you give them hugs. Rover also likes to return hugs! Alaska & Rover enjoy hanging out with their humans and just being near you makes them the happiest dogs in the world. They are both goofy, full of personality and always up for an adventure. They like to explore and would love to have a yard to run around and play in. These buddies are both well-mannered, working on leash-training and fully crate-trained.\n\nAlaska was found as a thin stray with a large gash on her leg and a couple scratches on her face. Her rescuers opened their front door and found her near their doorstep. They searched for weeks for potential owners, but no one claimed her. She was later surrendered to us. It didn't take long to realize she couldn't hear. HOWEVER, despite that, Alaska is still one of the friendliest, most loving puppies around! Rover was rescued as a stray. When his rescuer was unable to locate his owner, he was surrendered to us to find him a forever home. He has since learned what human affection is and he can't get enough! He will need patient owners who will correct him when he tries to jump on to hug new people. When he came into our care, he had never seemed to walk on a leash before or even knew what it was. We took him to professional training to help him learn a bit of obedience for leash-training and his hugging. Since his appointment, he is doing AMAZING with his training and has come so far already. He's quite motivated and trainable. Their adoption fee is $585 as a pair which covers the cost of their spay & neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchips and microchip registrations. If you're interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the following paragraphs for additional information about our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

He loves water more than anything and is a DNA tested: pit-bull, greyhound, retriever mix!\n\n Home setting: Shadow will do best as an only dog with a strong male or female figure in his life.  He would be better with older children. \n\n Shadow is also in need of a foster! He is currently in boarding and really needs some time spent with humans!

I am enjoying my stay in Loxahatchee Florida, but I really can't wait to meet my forever family and go to my forever home. I am very sweet and affectionate fellow if I do say so myself. I am tidy in my bunkroom and can assure that with your assistance I will bring my good habits home with me. I am low to medium energy which is the best part of us older pups so please make sure that is a good match for you. I do have a heart murmur and our medical team will be happy to explain that in more detail as well as the medication I need each day. I am also positive for Ehrlichia which is a tickborne disease - but thankfully both of these are treatable with medication.",

Hannah has been waiting 2 long years to find a furever home of her own.\n\nOur adoption fee for local adoptions within Texas is $200.00 and our adoption fee for our NJ and East Bound dogs is $400.00 and includes ground transport.\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered before adoption and are vaccinated for Rabies and DHPP.

            "description": "Update 12-12-20:\nOur apologies for slow responses!! We have been having multiple difficulties and are way behind responding to our inquiries. We will be trying to catch up over the next two weeks. Maggie is still available and we will be reviewing and responding to her inquiries as soon as possible.  Thanks for your patience! Email is our only communication at the moment.\n\nPLEASE READ BELOW IF INTERESTED IN THIS DOG! \n\nIF YOU ARE SEEING THIS LISTING, THEN THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE AND WE ARE PROCESSING INQUIRIES FOR ITS NEW HOME. We remove them immediately once we have stopped taking inquiries and have a pending home.\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW TO BE CONSIDERED. Please provide a contact phone number! Once we narrow down to the top three candidates, we usually call them to discuss details and then make our choice to meet the dog. Those who send no information about your home or family, or just ask is the dog available, how much, or how old will not be answered. All of that information is listed here and unfortunately, due to the volume of inquiries asking those basic questions, we are unable to answer all of the emails and texts. We also get a lot of people who send in the basic question because of the cute factor and really are not ready to adopt yet.  Please make sure that all of your household members are ready to adopt before pursuing adoption.\n\nWe understand that some of this is due to the new Petfinder format with their basic question at the bottom and apologize for that. In addition we are getting duplicates from most people because of confusion with Petfinder's new system which is making it difficult to tell if your inquiry was sent to us. Also the Petfinder new system asks for a zip code or location but does not forward that to us so we cannot tell your location. We do not fly our animals so please make sure that you are able to drive to Michigan if you are interested in one of our pets.  We are getting a lot of complaints from prospective homes trying to navigate Petfinder's new system and requests from several who enjoyed the various sections of our previous home page.  We cannot do anything about the changes to the format and the removal of the information on our home page, etc. Many people are simply sending their information to us directly at petangels@gmail.com or via text or voicemail to 734-645-7705 which may be a simpler solution at this point.\n\nWe do our best to place our adoptable animals within 1 to 2 weeks if they are ready to go and qualified homes are available. \n\n Please make sure ALL members of your family are in agreement to welcome a new dog to your family and you are ready to meet when you contact us. Thank you for your cooperation so these babies don't continue to grow up in their foster homes and bond to those families.\n\nWe may make our initial contact via text or email but our final candidates will be called when we are making our final decision.  If you have inquired and not provided a phone number yet, please provide one at 734-645-7705.\n\n  If you are just seeing the listing and are interested, please feel free to go ahead and inquire and tell us why you think the pup is a good fit and what it's life would be like if it joins your family. We will take down the listing as soon as the pup is in its new home.\n\nPosted 6-11-20:\n\nMaggie is starting her search for a new home. She is about 2 years old and looking for a home to love her forever.  \n\nWe aren't positive of her breed mix but think it is Chihuahua mixed with rat terrier, toy fox terrier, or possibly miniature Pinscher. Definitely one of the \"Little Napoleon\" personalities! She is also a great watchdog with a loud bark packed into that little body \n\nShe would do best as an only dog or with a submissive friend her size (she likes to be bossy and was chasing and nipping the owner's pit bull!). She LOVES attention and wants to be your constant companion.\n\nGuessing weight around 12 pounds although no one has told HER she's a small dog, haha! Will post more information and pictures soon. She is almost 2 years old. She basically looks like a long legged, light blond/apricot, chihuahua and is very agile. It appears she is used to jumping up on furniture to be with her person. She does listen well and with someone working with her, we think she will be pretty trainable. She is high medium to high energy level. We are still evaluating housebreaking as we go out frequently in the foster home, but so far she has only had one accident and it was really more of a \"marking\" episode at the beginning we think. She does well with a doggie door. Vet felt a spay scar and she hasn't come into heat yet so we think she is already spayed. \nWe had no vet history on her so she is beginning vaccines. \n\nIf interested in adopting, please email petangels@gmail.com or text 734-645-7705 and include your name, location, brief summary of family, work hours, dog experience, training and exercise plans, and a phone contact number.  \n\nWe have a phone issue at the moment and the voicemail cannot be cleared so I am only able to take incoming phone calls if I see them coming in.\n\nAdoption fee is $395 (cash with receipt).",

So does Poppy! She's selective about who she allows in her crew, but once you're in Poppy's club, you have VIP access for life. This girl is incredibly loving, snugly, loyal, goofy, and fun. She's down for whatever you're feeling that day, whether it's a nap in the sun or a hike in the woods. She's always there to keep you company, whatever the activity. Poppy's house manners and obedience are 10/10. How many dogs can be eye level with a steak while you're in the other room and not even bat an eye? Although she is crate trained, she has also proven herself trustworthy of being left alone. Looking for a walking or running companion? Poppy keeps whatever pace you set. And have no fear of running at night, Poppy is always ready to protect \"her person\". She thrives best in a one-dog home, outside of highly trafficked areas. She loves to watch the birds and squirrels, but can be anxious if there are a lot of passing humans or cars. Ideally, her people will be \"homebodies\" similar to her, without too many guests coming and going. Poppy thrives on routine, as most creatures do. Give this girl a stable, loving home, and she will reward you tenfold with her endless love and cuddles.\n\nAge: 4 years 8 mo\nWeight: 55 lbs.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at http://www.lasthopek9.org\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events visit our Facebook page.",

Cathy likes to jump on other dogs and wrestle when she plays and a quiet or submissive dog would be overwhelmed.  She also loves getting her ears scratched and her belly rubbed and loves having a pool available.  She is mostly house trained and walks well on leash.  Cathy has done fine with kids she has met.  She loves being with people and going for car rides as long as the windshield wipers are not going (they make her crazy).  Cathy would love a forever home with a big fenced yard so she can do some running and some kids or a tolerant dog to run and play with.",

First, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application. (Please do not call or text). We are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal(s). If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. If your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. We may ask you to send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets since we can't come into the home for the meet/greet due to Covid-19. We will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we) and have hand sanitizer. \n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. We like to stay in touch - pics, videos, social media, etc :-)\n",

            "description": "MEET BO!! Bo has had quite a sad history. He needs and deserves to find his forever family. Bo's story has a sad beginning. Bo was at the mercy of an abusive owner who allowed the owner's other aggressive alpha dog to repeatedly attack him. Fortunately Bo was removed from that environment and was treated for extensive bite wounds. Despite this horrid abuse, Bo loves to be with people who care for him.\n\nBo has a sweet, loving disposition and has won the hearts of many of his caretakers at the shelter. He just wants to cuddle and love his people. However, he is dog reactive which has lead to a couple of accidental bites of his human caretaker.s Because of this, Bo needs to be the only dog in the family and should not be let off leash at all.\n\nBo has been evaluated and worked with a dog behaviorist named Crystal Blaker. He has passed all evaluations with flying colors! The threat of being euthanized is hanging over this boy's head. This big goofball deserves a family of his own where he is the only four-legged animal in the family. Please meet this great dog and give him a home he deserves.\n\n**Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\n>>>\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

She's resource aggressive and doesn't share well with other pets. She doesn't enjoy other dogs, they make her nervous, and she will bark - but can be introduced carefully to submissive dogs. Very affectionate, obedient and eager to please - she loves human companionship,\n\nsits on command and takes treats gently\n\n. A\n\nperfect housemate for people, she is house-trained. Stays by your side when loose (unless she spots another dog), likes you to throw the ball once in awhile and keep her company while she's outside. Needs a calm household and a small fenced yard (would love long walks), but she can be left home unattended and doesn't require a crate. She prefers to be the only animal in the home - but has shared a play area with a smaller non-aggressive male successfully for short periods of time. A senior girl but very active and healthy!\n\nHer adoption fee has been lovingly sponsored by one of our supporting friends of animals in memory of her own dog; in order to help GiGi go to that special loving and forever home for her. Please fill out an adoption application at our website - stoveranimalrescue.com - and make an appointment to come meet GiGi!",

He enjoys spending the day outside and coming in for bedtime. Makes a great companion, and will need a patient owner willing to devote some time to training.

If you are looking for a playful dog who you can take to the park with you, than Lacey is the perfect dog for you!

She is so smart and loves to learn! \n\nCollierville Animal Services staff and volunteers socialize and work with our adoptable dogs on a daily basis.

With one volunteer available to review all applications, we ask for your patience waiting for an email response. While we are closed to the public, we will only be responding to pet inquiries that accompany an application. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nNadia came to us with twenty-one other dogs but not with much background information. Her living conditions were not good, but you cannot tell by the way she has thrived here with us. Nadia is still a little shy, but she is a sweet girl who is loving all the affection she is now receiving. Nadia's estimated DOB is 8/1/2013; she weighs approximately 63 pounds.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

However, transportation is available for adoptions within our coverage area. \nRuby is an adorable, petite girl who has beautiful eyes. She lovesssss belly rubs and cuddling with her humans! Ruby takes a little time to warm up to new people, and will need continued reinforcement on how to greet new people. But once she knows you, shes your friend! Ruby will sometimes try to jump up on people, so thats something shes been working on. But shes getting better. Ruby loves her known people, but she can be barrier reactive to people she doesnt know. She will need continued work on that. A home with a privacy fence would be in her best interest at this point in her training. She also tends to be leash reactive. Continued obedience training and socialization will help her with these issues. \nRuby is a 4 year old, 78lb mixed Rottie with a little bit of puppy energy left but mostly she is a calm and low-key lapdog. She loves to lay on her back and snore a little while enjoying those endless belly rubs. She is house-trained. We have left her in a crate and mud room for the day with no accidents. \nRuby loves walking, sniffing, rolling around in the grass, chasing toys, chewing bones and running in circles hopping around like a kangaroo when the mood strikes. She has a few basic commands but she is learning more basic obedience. Once she has mastered all the basic commands such as stay, come and heel, she will be an awesome best friend for life. She is getting better each day with her manners. She is very food focused along with positive reinforcement. \nRuby would do better in a home with humans to love her but no animals or children. She gets very excited when she sees cats, dogs, horses, geese or stuffed animals. When she learns more self-control through basic obedience she might do better with other animals over time, but at the moment any moving object is a challenge to be played with. On her first day in rescue, Ruby managed to get close enough to the kitty for one second to say hi and ended up with a quick claw to her right eye which ended in surgery to save her eye. She has healed, but still has a scar in her eye which may affect her vision slightly.",

            "description": "Adorable. Hilarious. Smart as heck. What more could you want in a dog? C'Lo is most likely to be voted class clown and spends his days charming his volunteer friends and making them laugh. He is playful and up for anything. Fetch? Tug? Going for a dip in the doggie pool? Entertaining himself with his favorite stuffed toys or food puzzles? C'Lo rocks at all those things and more! He's a star at training games too and loves to work and learn. C'Lo regularly goes on field trips to parks and neighborhoods around town where he's excellent on a leash and passes people, other dogs, bicycles, and even lawnmowers politely. He's also been doing home visits to practice his behavior indoors. C'Lo will need some support with settling indoors when he transitions to a home but he's made great strides and we know how to set him up for success. What does C'Lo want in his human? A sense of humor and fun and someone who'll adore him as much as he will adore them. This guy happens to be a devoted love bug too. The Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at Austin Animal Center) will be there every step of the way to make sure that C'Lo is set up for success in his new home. Will you give this adorable goofball a chance? I weigh approximately 54 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

Once he is comfortable he likes affection & playing with toys. Tuck is very strong so someone with large breed experience would be ideal. We strongly recommend a fenced yard for this guy. He previously lived with kids but since he can be slow to warm up we recommend kids at least 10. We think Tuck will be happiest as the only pet in the home.\n\nContact: ncruickshank@MidlandsHumaneSociety.org\n\nThese animals are looking for homes through private parties in the Siouxland area.

Did not understand what the heck happened! He has adjusted now but sure would like to get him back into a home environment.  Housebroken, will have him neutered soon.\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and deworming.\nPlease contact foster parent Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email adbadoptions@yahoo.com.

            "description": "Hello, my friends!!! It's time! I'm ready to be adopted!\n\nMy name is Preston. I am a very happy and relaxed 9-year-old neutered male. I am extremely well-mannered and quite a gentleman. My last person trained me very well. I seem to have quite a good grasp of the English language and pretty much know everything you are saying. I had a few health issues when I arrived here at Homeward Bound Rescue but I'm all fixed and ready to live the rest of my life with one family who just happens to have a lot of love and affection to share!\n\nI recently had a mast cell tumour removed from the side of my neck and had 3 teeth removed. The incision on the side of my neck was quite large but it is almost completely healed and the hair is starting to grow back. I also have a food intolerance to chicken (which makes me very itchy and flaky) and I had some urinary issues so we fixed that up. I am now on a prescription food that has no chicken in it and it helps me so that I don't develop any crystals in my urine. I also take a pill twice a day (it tastes like a cookie!) that helps too.\n\nI love going for walks and car rides! I live for these moments! My foster mom hasn't really tried walking me properly because of my recent incision but she is quite sure I'm a pretty good boy because when she starts to fall behind and I get to the end of my leash I always stop and wait for her. Sometimes I see another dog that I am familiar with and I have been known to pull once or twice in those instances because I am so excited to see a friend. I don't think all dogs are my friends though, once I saw another large male dog and I growled and barked. I think I like to be the alpha male in the room. There isn't a lady that I haven't liked though and I pretty much love all smaller dogs and get along great with all humans! My foster mom says hello to everyone we see and I will just keep walking and not pay any attention to them unless my foster mom stops to talk. Then I am friendly too! That's my cue. Even if other dogs bark at me I usually just keep walking and don't even look at them if that's what foster mom does. Don't forget I like the car too! I will always be ready to jump into an idling car! Even when I don't know the person! That's how much I love the car. I like the front seat whenever possible. I am really good at waiting until I'm invited to get out of the car. \n\nI like being with my foster mom all the time. She stays at home all day and I love that. I even like to follow her to the bathroom and wait outside of it while she's in there. Sometimes when she takes a long time in the laundry room I get tired of waiting and I just lean myself gently against her legs and grab a couple of winks. I wish we could just stay on the couch all day and cuddle. Foster mom lets me sleep in the bed with her. It's a big bed. Sometimes there ends up with some space between us but don't you worry... I make sure to always close the gap. I like to make sure my back is touching someone most of the time. I'm sure she really appreciates how thoughtful I am. I have slept in a crate too. Either way, it'll just take some adjustment. I adjust pretty easily actually.\n\nHave I told you how hungry I am yet? I am a big hungry boy. I have a clockwork type of system that has my tummy alarm ringing at almost 4-hour intervals. Mom always tries to stretch my meals out a bit but she pretty much feeds me less food more often. This keeps me happy and it also helps to not add on any extra pounds to my perfectly muscular frame. I always wait nicely for my food until my foster mom says \"\"good boy, go ahead\"\". If I can't wait until dinner time, mom lets me have some baby carrots and I love munching on those. Sometimes she puts some peanut butter or cheese whiz in my bone but this is just a special treat. I am always watching those calories! I like the store-bought treats too! A LOT! Foster mom is always careful to give me beef or salmon and always looks for hidden chicken.\n\nNow as I said, I am very well-mannered but nobody's perfect! If something incredibly delicious is in the garbage, I might try to steal it the next time you leave the room. If you have something very yummy, I'll probably not even look at you if my tummy is full, but if you leave your plate unattended, I cannot promise so much self-control that I won't steal it. It has been known to happen.\n\nI do like to communicate. I have a plethora of sounds in my repertoire that I will show you when I want something. If my water dish is empty, I will tell you. If I need out, I will bark at you instead of going to the door. If I feel it must be dinner time by now, I will whine, bark, moo... it could be anything really. I don't make any of these sounds without good reason though. So, if I'm noisy, I'm needing something. I tried to trick foster mom into feeding me more when I first arrived by barking quite a bit. If I had been out, eaten, drank and there was nothing left to check, foster mom would sternly say \"\"No, go lie down\"\". I will listen when she does that. Sometimes she starts with \"\"Go on, out of the kitchen\"\", and I'll do that too (but I'll be back).\n\nA couple of extra quirky adorable things about me? I sneeze every time I go outside. Every. Time. I like to roll around after meals on the blanket or couch and I like to fix the blankets when making my bed at night. I like to have my chest rubbed after my breakfast or dinner until I get sleepy enough to nap. When you kiss my face, I'll probably kiss the end of your nose... sometimes your ear.\n\nI really am the sweetest boy and will make you very happy. I'm sure of it.\n\n- No to cats\n- small or calm dogs ok\n-kids over 5 please",

He's kinda our problem child because he destroys everything we put into his kennel. Boredom and sitting in his kennel for long periods of time certainly doesn't help the situation.

Ash has lots of energy so regular exercise will be a must of him.\n\nFrom intake:\nOwner released due to family change\nDescribed as active\nLived outside - High energy\nNegatives: Barks excessively\nThese dogs haven't been messed with much and need training to learn to walk on a leash. They roll, don't move and/or freak out and rear up. This is something our volunteers will help work on.\nMixie is mom - Giles & Mordecai are brothers\n\n\u2014\u2014\nAsh has been selected for Puppies for Parole - an 8 week obedience training program. His start date has been temporarily suspended so he can be adopted at any time. Ash\u2019s adoption fee is $40 and includes his neuter, up-to-date vaccinations and microchipped.

This guy has a more chill personality and does well with other dogs but so keen on hyper dogs so he'd do best in a home with another more calm dog. He does well with the children in his foster home. \n He is presently 90lbs and could actually gain a bit of weight.  Like all large dogs, Sonny is sure that he is a lap dog and is a fantastic cuddler.  This calm guy just loves to be by your side.  He was unfortunately heartworm positive but has completed his treatment and is completely healthy!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Sonny, please fill out an application via our website at https://therescueproject.net/adoption-application and we will get back to you via email once your application has been reviewed.  If you have further questions please feel free to reach out to us at adoptionstrp@gmail.com\n\nSonny's adoption fee is $200 and includes age appropriate vaccines, neuter, microchip, deworm, heartworm testing and treatment.",

            "description": "\u201cYou can\u2019t resist reading Pointer\u2019s profile  because he is so darn cute, but Pointer isn\u2019t for everyone. Pointer is a Blue Heeler mix, weighing in at less than 30 lbs. Just like bigger herding dogs, Pointer likes to chase, herd, nip heels and is very strong-willed. Pointer needs lots of exercise and must have mental stimulation throughout the day. He enjoys learning commands and working on his obedience commands and would make an excellent agility, nose work, scent work or other sport participant. Pointer is not a couch potato and when left to entertain himself, he can get into trouble. Pointer needs a person who is experienced with herding breeds or dogs who are competitive in sports and are not put off by his strong personality.  With the right person, Pointer can be the ultimate friend!  I would not be a candidate for an apartment, condo/townhome or a home without a fence. If interested in giving me a forever home please complete an application at www.safeanimalhaven.com\n\n\nAustralian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler Characteristics\n\nStanding between 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns blue-gray or red. Both coat varieties feature distinctive mottling or specking patterns. ACDs have immense work drive and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners.\nACDs are true-blue loyal, famously smart, ever alert, and wary of strangers. If an ACD isn\u2019t challenged, he easily becomes bored and gets into mischief. It is recommended that ACD owners participate with their dog in some work, sport, or regular exercise to keep him mentally and physically fit.",

            "description": "Faith is a precious approximately 1 year old pup. She weighs 32 pounds.   Faith is an old soul who came to us after being first shot with buckshot several times and then abandoned in a rural area.    You'd never know that humans were bad to her though.  She's one of the most loving pups you've ever known.   Faith is quiet and loves her chew toys!  She is still a puppy so chewing is fun for her.   She is kennel trained and sleeps in a kennel at night.  She loves attention and being rubbed on.   If any pup deserves a second chance at a great life, it's sweet Faith. \n Like most rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

            "description": "Gunner is a 2-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. Gunner is a higher energy dog and is looking for an active adopter with a fenced backyard. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to Colorado's Safer At Home policies and to abide by social distancing protocols, we are HIGHLY encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. All adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically, should you want to proceed forward with the adoption. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

She does great on the leash, and prefers leisure walks where she can take a minute for sniffs when she wants. She also enjoys being outside in the garden and napping in the sun. \n\nTootsie gets along fine with her foster dog sisters, but enjoys being with her foster mom and dad most and would be fine as the only pet. She is curious about the house cat and will try to follow her around to get a closer look, but does not chase. She will wait until she is invited to jump on the couch and waits patiently while her meals are prepared. She would do best in a home that can give her a regular eating and walking routine. \n\nThis sweet lady is looking for a home where she can enjoy some head scratches, naps, and relaxation! Come meet Tootsie at Mary's in Key Largo \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to LRRoF.org NOW and fill out an application.\n\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nYour support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today!\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family. All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.",

Their loss could be your gain! Trixie is a real catch! Trixie went into foster care at the end of June, but she's still available for adoption if you're interested! Her foster says Trixie is not her best self around other dogs, but she loves to cuddle and have her belly rubbed. She has learned sit, and will wait for her food.",

Brimley LOVES food, even more than his people, but unfortunately due to his special dietary needs, he will need to be monitored in the home when food is around. Brimley is a diabetic and will require insulin. ARF with the help of the Kit Kat Fund have seen to it that all of his medical needs have been met. Brimley is an active little guy who enjoys going for walks with his favorite stuffed things. He is not great with other dogs, but is learning to ignore them. He is working on his basic obedience and is crate trained. Brimley's adoption fee has been covered by the Kit Kat Fund. He is ready to take over a home! Are you ready for him?",

I take some time to get used to and trust new people and need slow proper introductions, but once I know and trust you, we could have tons of fun. I'm very smart and food motivated, and extremely active! I love to run and play fetch and play in water pools! I would be great at agility and dock diving, I'd love a job that will test my mind and provide physical and mental stimulation. \nContinued training is a must, I deserve the time and patience to learn how to be the great dog my PCHS family knows I can be. \nFor more information, please call the Pike County Humane Society at  (570)296-7654 or send Email to pikecountyhs@gmail.com.Please Note: Petfinder listings may not always be up to date! Please call the shelter to make sure this dog is still available. All dogs and cats are micro-chipped for their protection.",

He was surrendered to the rescue because his owner moved into an apt. and no longer had time for him. He is dog friendly but will do best as the only dog in the home as can be very protective of \"his\" stuff. He would do great with a active single female. He would make a great jogging companion. He does loves to swim so a home with a fenced in yard with a pool would be perfect. Loves going for car rides too. Located in A foster home in Boca. 2/1/21 1:42 PM",

He has been in a home this whole time, but unfortunately, he had to come back to Eleventh Hour Rescue as they were about to have a baby. Boris is a sweet boy, but he suffers from high anxiety and would not do well at all around a newborn baby. In fact, he would do best in an adults only home with minimal social traffic. He needs someone who is willing to work with him, and in return, he will love you to pieces.\n\nBoris can not be left alone for long periods of time. He always wants to be with his person! He is frightened by other dogs, so would do best as an only pet. Boris would really benefit from daily exercise and mental stimulation games. He is just afraid of the world and has no other way to project it other than with anxiety... He needs a hero!\n\nIf you are interested in being Boris' hero, visit EHRDOGS.ORG and fill out an application. Be sure to mention BORIS/JAX KOSOVO!!!!!!",

I'm very smart and learn commands and house rules very quickly. I'm crate trained, doggie door trained, and great off-leash with proper instructions. I have all the best qualities of a puppy without the messy nonsense! I'm athletic and adventurous and love car rides, hikes, playing fetch, and going new places! I will be your best friend forever once we have established trust. I can be nervous meeting new people, they can be scary to me until I know that I can trust them and they won't hurt me, but with you by my side I can overcome that nervousness. If you want to meet me, I can show you what a great addition I would make to your family! I have gone through extensive training and I love to work and be given a job to do! I appreciate having consistency in my life. I have a solid foundation of obedience training including sit, down, down stay, recall, place command, and so much more! I'm also fantastic at agility! I love it! My adopters will receive included follow up training with me as well as a best friend for life! I need to be your one and only pet in the home, but that's just because I have so much love to give! Contact Mayday today to set up a meeting with me so we can start our new life together! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

            "description": "A story about Wallace.. \nWallace came to PCHS in the fall of 2019 as a local stray unclaimed, a young man who probably prior to arrival, really didn\u2019t have much in the way of training & direction. Wallace became part of the PCHS family, he found lots of dog friends his size & activity level. \nWe worked with him boosting confidence, basic training & continued on with his interactions in all aspects. \nWally certainly took to all of the staff at the shelter, he wants to please. \nWe had found a great family for him after some time. A family with another dog, perfect! \nWallace loves to have a buddy. His family went over the moon to help him in his new home & lifestyle, camping, social, activities playing with the whole family, additional basic training along with the love he wanted. And he gave the love back. \nWe give full praise to this family. And appreciate them opening their hearts & home for Wallace. \nSeveral months passed and it was clear, Wallace needed a different lifestyle. Something beyond what was able to be provided, not for lack of trying or caring. \nWe promised them, we would work with him & continue to give positive direction in all aspects of his days back at the shelter. \nWe appreciate their decision, as we have assessed over the past few months, Wally needs a farm type life. A farm life? Yes ? \nIt isn\u2019t as simple as just saying this, we truly believe he will thrive better in that type of environment. \nPCHS has fenced in acres for the ideal activity for many dogs, but especially Wallace. \nHe spends time with all the humans at Pike, as well as some of the almost equally active dogs too. \nWally is a very smart dog, he needs much physical and mental stimulation. He loves to be kept busy ! We believe that he would be great in scent-work. \nHe\u2019s fixed, housebroken, UTD, chipped & for all accounts, a healthy young man at about 2 1/2 years old. \nHound traits, very much so, puppy like play... absolutely. A loyal buddy, ? \nWallace can spend his time happily running about, or one on one with staff, leash walking- & hugging!! \nBonding with dogs his size is his thing & we see, the most minimal time to rest, as he has a mind that needs frequent stimulation. \nDoes he nap? Yes. Does his like treats? Yes. Does he smile? Oh yes !\nWe are Re-listing Wallace now, we are also asking that if you or your family lifestyle is something that will meet all of his needs, his high activity levels, his desire for a \u2018job\u2019 almost..... if you are that person, give us a call 570-296-7654 & speak with staff directly. \nYes he\u2019s adorable, yes he\u2019s a little goofy but he requires stability in a farm type atmosphere, where working, is kind of satisfying. \nCriteria specified, must be met for an approval for his adoption. \n\nWe are not accepting visitors at this time, we ask that you contact our office. 570-296-7654 \nWallace will be a fun & loyal partner for the home that meets all his needs. \nApplications are strictly through our website, but, with Wallace, staff will need to speak with a potential adopter along with any serious applicant. \nBeyond that, protocol at this time, if an adopter is approved, staff will contact you for an appointment & plenty of time to spend learning more about this darling young man. \n\nhttps://www.pikecountyhumanesociety.org/\nFor more information, please call the Pike County Humane Society at  (570)296-7654 or send Email to pikecountyhs@gmail.com.Please Note: Petfinder listings may not always be up to date! Please call the shelter to make sure this dog is still available. All dogs and cats are micro-chipped for their protection.",

            "description": "Meet Honey Bunny! Bunny is a 12 month old female Yorkie who was surrendered by her owner due to having an issue with her back leg. Bunny was seen in June  at Tufts for an orthopedic consult. X-rays and an examination confirmed a severe luxating patella.  We were told that they would be bale to fix the knee but it would be an extensive and expensive surgery requiring a bone to be broken. Tufts wanted Bunny to grow a little more  and make sure her growth plates were closed before surgery her next orthopedic consult is December 15th.  \n\n12/16 Update: Bunny went to her consult on December 15th and due to the deformity of the leg (which has been the same since we got her) and her now almost being full grown they wanted to do a CT scan so they could see what exactly was going on.\n\nBunny had her CT scan on the 16th. We are still waiting to speak with the surgeon in detail about the CT scan and whether Bunny is a candidate for surgery. The CT scan showed that she does not have a grove on either of her femur bones which you need in order to do patella surgery. They are looking into other options such as a prosthetic grove. Please keep Bunny in your thoughts as this was not what we were expecting to hear.  \n\n1/5  Bunny's orthopedic surgeon was able to find an implant small enough that should work on being able to fix her knee. Due to the extensive surgery required, the expense of the implant and the requirement of 3D imaging her surgery is estimated to cost almost $9000. Please consider donating to Bunny to help fix her knee so she can walk, run and play like a normal 1 year old dog should be able to do. Thank you. You can donate on our website www.yorkiesinc.com\n\n Bunny is not ready for adoption and won't be ready till after we have done everything we can to fix her knee. Please keep Bunny in your thoughts. Thank you!\n\n",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Gurtie, and I'm a very special girl! I was found roaming the streets of Florida in February and was soon after taken in by a foster family that was temporarily living in Florida. I immediately stole their hearts with my wittiness and affection and ability to snuggle for hours on end, and when it was time for them to leave Florida they couldn\u2019t bear to take me back to the shelter, so they drove me 1,200 miles to Austin where I was taken in by New Hope Animal Rescue. I am probably the cuddliest dog you will ever meet (though I won't get in your face and lick you when you're trying to tie your shoes) and have no problem making myself comfortable in a crate, on my back, or on your lap! I am currently fostered with other dogs. \n\nFROM HER FOSTER PARENTS:\nGurtie has a heart of gold and falls in love with every human she meets. She is 6-7 years old, weighs 52 pounds and is spayed and up-to-date on vaccinations. She recently took an eight-week obedience training course and has mastered all the basic commands (sit, down, stay, wait), can heel for up to five minutes, and will sit in the same spot for five minutes as well as lay down in the same spot for 10 minutes on command. She also walks perfectly on the leash (no pulling!) and is an amazing listener -- I continue to be impressed by her loyalty! Her favorite things are butt scratches, hunting for geckos, chilling on my paddleboard, long walks/runs and car rides, and her very favorite is couch cuddles on any belly she can find at any time of day. She is such a funny girl with so much love to give, and it's clear why her first foster family couldn\u2019t let that go to waste. She is going to make someone very happy.",

Animal Control brought us to a shelter that euthanized four of my friends immediately and gave the rest of us only a 72 hour deadline to be rescued or killed.  I knew I was one of the most \"at risk\" dogs on the euthanasia list just simply due to my rear legs.  I walk differently (see vide link) but the vet says I'm a happy girl who does not know I'm different from other dogs and she says I'm not in pain.  Nothing gets me more excited than seeing you reach for the leash! I\u2019m currently fostered with dogs and cats. I crave lots of human love and affection.\n\nMy foster says I do great with the dog door and even the stairs going up and down his porch.  I'm VERY into people and love affection, even from strangers! I'm sensitive. If my foster raises his voice, I'll try to hide.  I'm a quiet girl and I do love playing with other dogs.  I know there is someone with a big heart out there for me.  Could it be you?  \n\nSee Melissa's story here: \nhttps://youtu.be/n7ttOxZDcDQ\n\nMelissa\nShar Pei/Lab mix \nFemale \n3 years old \n38 lbs \n\nThis is me at the shelter  - see how I walk. \nhttps://youtu.be/MxQQb5Q4YuI\n\nNew Hope Animal Rescue is happy to have you meet me to see if I'm a good fit for your home.  They just ask you complete their online application first. I'm fostered in Austin TX. \nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/\n",

Camper is very selective on dog friends and he does need a home with no cats. He likes to ride in the car and really enjoys adventures.\n\n*Required to stay within a one hour radius of Ayres Shelter*",

Since then Bodie has come out of his shell and easily became my favorite boy (don't tell the others). This sweet boy plays well with others and children (7 and up). He loves his toys and treats, he is very food motivated! Bodie is working on his leash skills and has improved them since he has been with us! Bodie is a huge lover, that is all he wants. It does take him a little bit to trust people, but once he does...all he wants to do is be with you! He is a very happy boy, he loves to run and play with his friends. If you give him a toy, he will bring it all the way to his kennel and hoard it!Please visit our website, www.colonialcapitalhs.org to fill out an application today!",

This poor girl is very shy and will require a new family that is patient with her as she comes out of her shell. She is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, crate trained and petite at only 34 lbs. She would do best in a family with children over 10 year old as she is very active. She would also enjoy a doggie sibling that is laid back, confident and loves to play. She loves to do zoomies and would love a fenced yard. She is almost 3 years old and fully grown.",

            "description": "Maestro is a handsome young lad estimated around 2 years of age and believed to be an English Shepherd. Maestro found himself at the shelter as a stray and his past is a mystery. Maestro has taken some time to come around to having new humans in his life and is now ready to look for a home of his own.\n\nMaestro is a playful, goofy, loyal, and game-y young guy who is looking for a close bond and lots of adventures. Maestro is still learning how to trust new humans and requires a slow, patient introduction preferably during a walk. He loves going on walks and hikes and is a very active young guy - he is particularly fond of exploring muddy ponds. Maestro does have some herding dog tendencies such as circling and wanting to be very mouth on that require understanding and redirection. Maestro is a loving and eager to please guy that is going to thrive with structured socialization and building his library of compassionate experiences. Maestro is learning that the care isn't scary and doing a wonderful job although they aren't his favorite yet. Maestro is very weary of children and is not recommended for a home with children under 13 years old.\n\nMaestro is very dog savvy and lives with a variety of other personalities. He does a great job of navigating play groups and respecting the boundaries of other dogs. He currently prefers trying to play with his preferred humans but is figuring out how to play with the other dogs over time. Maestro has not met any small dogs or cats at this time.\n\nMaestro is searching for a home that values his herding skills and loyalty that can guide him in his ongoing socialization and adventure seeking.

I love to eat so much that I steal food from other foster dogs and my foster mom is not very happy about that. I just can't help myself! I guess I'm just bored with my special diet. You see, I have a liver shunt but my doctor says that it is manageable with a no meat protein diet. That stinks because I really love meat! Anyway, my special diet isn't that expensive or hard to do but it would be much easier if I was the only dog. I also have a special ability. Have you ever heard of Harry Houdini? Well, I'm kind of like him. I can figure out how to get out of my crate sometimes and run around so I can steal other dogs' food. Tee hee hee. . .. I will come back though when you call my name because I'm a good boy. I love to snuggle, I'm house trained and I'm really good on car rides too! So, when can I meet you? I'm ready to find my new home soon! Age: 7 Weight: 8 pounds HW status: negative Best guess on breed/mix: Chihuahua To apply for this pet, please go to our website Bluetails Pet Professionals and get your adoption application started today!

He also loves swimming in their pool too!  To say that Beau is adaptable to new things and is eager to please is an understatement.  Beau is a very sweet boy, very gentle and gets along with everyone he meets. He is house-trained and able to stay loose in the house when home alone.\nBeau is also neutered, heartworm negative and current on his shots.\nAdoption fee is $250. Only local adoptions in the Atlanta area allowed.",

When Two Tailz rescued him, his injuries aligned with that of being dragged by a car, and some markings that may suggest being bit by other dogs. Although his story is absolutely heartbreaking, this boy has made a full recovery and his soul completely shines!\n\nOakley is a 1.5-2yr old beautiful, loving and funny pibble!  He is house-trained and LOVES to snuggle!  He has eyes and a smile that will melt your heart! \n\nOakley is a significantly calm dog, especially at his young age! He loves his walks, basking in the sun, he loves his toys and of course will bust out his zoomies and be a total goof! \n\nHe will do best as the apply of your eye- no other dogs. However, with the proper introduction and supervision he could be able to live with another dog! He was not socialized correctly in the beginning of his life and so we have to work to do that now!\n\nOakley is a TOTAL lover and he is VERY attached to his human like velcro! He wants to please, is a great listener and is a total love bug. \n\n*Please note that a fenced yard is required for Oakley!\n\nApply to adopt Oakley on www.twotailzrescue.org\n",

He is an 8 year old Chihuahua mix who weighs about 10 pounds. We had him neutered, chipped and gave him all routine vaccinations.\nHe is really blossoming here and is developing quite a personality.  He can be a little bully to other male dogs but doesn't get aggressive.  Jacob is very mellow and quiet otherwise and would make a great friend to a lonely heart. He loves to have his back scratched and makes funny grunting noises while being scratched.\n\nIf you would like to meet Jacob or have any questions please contact Paw Parent 661-724-0642 pawparent@gmail.com",

            "description": "This sweet girl is Kiri. She is an American Staffordshire Terrier mix, and she is approximately 8-10 years old and weighs about 50 pounds.  She came from a rescue that was being closed so Paw Parent stepped in and took her in.\n\nOriginally Kiri was relinquished along with a male poodle whom she loved. He was adopted and Kiri has been waiting for her forever home for over 7 years now. Kiri loves people of all sizes, and does fine with most dogs. She is great on a leash and off a leash, and likes to dip into water. She is super affectionate and can be very playful. She has lots of love to give, and loves to just sit with her people. Kiri was recently adopted and returned due to misunderstanding. Kiri has been in a kennel so long that she does develop a certain possessiveness over her special space. Kiri needs to have her own special bed, and will let you know with a little growl if you are intruding.. In her years in a kennel she always had her own bed. She can become a little protective over her special area, and we completely understand why. \n\nKiri is spayed, chipped, and up to date on all routine vaccinations. If you would like more information about Kiri or you would like to meet her please contact Paw Parent 661-724-0642 pawparent@gmail.com",

            "description": "Let\u2019s play!  Merry Meka is a three year old female Pitbull mix with a disposition as sunny as her smile.  This is one happy dog that enjoys being around people, children and other dogs.  She\u2019s a big softy who would rather snuggle than quarrel.  Meka loves outdoor activities and will play fetch for hours.  Meka travels well and would enjoy trips to the park.  She\u2019s also a big fan of water and enjoys a quick dip in the pool or lake.  But if thunder roars, she must come indoors.  She isn\u2019t crazy about the big booms.  Meka is housebroken and well behaved in the home.  No worries about chewed up furniture or shoes with this girl.  If she misbehaves, a stern voice is usually all the correction she needs.  She is eager to please and very smart.  This is a wonderful family dog that you will love to own.  To adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.

Nala has been an attentive and devoted Mom but now it\u2019s her time to be pampered.  We are looking for just the right home for this gorgeous girl.  She\u2019s a looker, with a sparkling white coat and cute perky ears.  Plus, you can\u2019t miss that classic bulldog eye patch.  Nala is a lover, not a fighter.  She smiles all the time and is extremely affectionate with everyone.  Nala is a large powerful dog who thinks she is a lap baby.  In her enthusiasm to give you a smooch, she may knock you over.  For this reason, Nala would be a good fit for a family with older children.  She prefers to be the only pet in the home.  Nala looks forward to her time out in the shelter play yard when she can run and play; she loves the water!  She would love to have her own large fenced in yard so she can stretch her legs and burn off energy.  Nala would make a great running or hiking partner.  No course is too tough for this girl.  Once she\u2019s tuckered out, Nala likes to crash next to you and catch up on her zzz\u2019s.  If you\u2019re looking for a dog that will love you to the moon and back, Nala is the right dog for you.

He is amazing on walks and never barks at other animals or people.\n\nWhile in the house he likes to keep to himself, observe and socialize on his terms. Reno is still overcoming some anxiety issues from the demons of his past but has never shown aggression.\n\nHe is potty trained, loves other dogs but can get overwhelmed if the other dog has a rough play style. He would love a forever home with another laid back dog in it!\n\nHe'd do best in a low traffic household with no kids where there are not a lot of new and different people coming and going or frequent social gatherings. \n\nEmail foster@kcpetproject.org to learn more about Reno!",

He's great with all people and loves respectful children. With proper introductions, he will do well with a very submissive medium-sized doggy companion, as Trooper wants to be top dog. No cats or small dogs for Trooper, thank you! He needs a secluded home away from busy streets, and with a fenced-in yard, where he can run and play. Being a tripod doesn't hold him back! His foster mom says that he is just the sweetest soul, a happy go lucky boy and a great snuggle-buddy. Whoever adopts this handsome hunk is going to hit the jackpot! Trooper is neutered and up to date on vaccines, If you would like to adopt Trooper, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "Well, the time has finally come for Goosie to find his forever family!  It\u2019s been a long journey to get here \u2013 he started out as part of a cruelty seizure by the Harris Co Cruelty Task Force, having his front leg amputated, ongoing rehabilitation to increase strength, and finding a mobility solution that gives him the ability to go longer distances. \n\nGoose will always be a special needs pup, but I\u2019ve taken him as far as I can as a foster and he\u2019s ready to move to the next phase of life!  He needs someone who\u2019s willing to provide patience & time as he continues to grow stronger, he may need physical therapy either at home or with a professional (that could be as simple as swimming in the pool) and continued practice with his front wheel cart. He\u2019s making progress every time he uses his cart! \n\nHaving another dog in the home would be preferred, but not required, because during his first 6-7 months of life, he missed out on developing critical socialization skills. Those skills are developing and he\u2019s doing significantly better than first coming to his foster home. The recommendation on the type of dog he would reside with is one who is young, good with rough play, is easy-going and on the medium to large size. Part of the socialization he missed out on is how to engage and play with other dogs, and with his front limb missing, his way of playing can be a little awkward. \n\nIt is also recommended that Goose not be around young kids, he tends to jump when he gets excited or wants your attention. We believe it\u2019s what he would do in his original environment because he was so desperate for contact and attention. \n\nGoose does understand different commands (No, Sit, Stay, Night-Night, Go Potty), and once he gets to know you, he will respond better and better. He would do fine around older kids (teens) who are able to correctly engage.  \n\nHe also does well with other dogs, is curious about cats but learns quickly to leave them alone, house trained, sleeps great in his kennel, knows what \u2018Night-Night\u2019 means, and will do well in his kennel if you need to leave the home. \n\nGoose is not kenneled today when leaving during the day, so he only sleeps in there at night.  He\u2019s also a great snuggler so sometimes he gets to sleep in the bed. :) I know this sounds like a lot, but he\u2019s so worth it and he\u2019s worked so hard to get where he is today.  He has come such a LONG way, and really deserves someone who wants to show him what the good life is, and what it\u2019s like to be loved unconditionally. Plus, he\u2019s got the most beautiful eyes and that bottom lip of his will get you every time. \n\n (New family will receive his front wheel cart) \n\nTo check out more pictures and videos of Goose, please check his FB and IG pages. \u2022 Goose\u2019s FB page: @GoosieGoosieGoose \u2022 Goose\u2019s IG page: Goosie_GoosieGoose",

With much needed TLC and veterinary care she has made a miraculous recovery and now weight 55lbs. \nPeach is in need of a home to live out the rest of her life. Being Diabetic, Blind with glaucoma, and heartworm positive it is hard to tell how much time she has left. She is sweet as can be & LOVES kids. Peach is insulin dependent but doesn't mind the needles one bit. She is on various medications but takes them all very easily. \n\nPeach just needs a comfy bed to sleep on and the occasional potty break / sun bathing break. Besides her medications she is very low maintenance. \n\nOur rescue will help with medical costs for the rest of her life if she is kept local to Punta Gorda, but at this time her medications are relatively inexpensive.\n\nPlease send us an email if you are interested in helping our special Peach Pie.",

I do like to play with other dogs, however, I can be selective with who I choose to spend my time with. I do have a relatively strong prey drive so I would not be a good fit if you have a cat or other small animals. I'm also probably best for an adult-only family, preferably with an experienced dog owner, who is familiar with working with large dogs with lots of energy. I would love to find a home that has a great big yard to run and play in. I think I would really enjoy living in a home with busy energy that matches my own. I definitely need continued training, particularly as it relates to jumping and chewing on things that I'm not supposed to, but I've almost got potty-training down! I do love to go for leashed walks and I love to play with toys.",

I would like to place these girls together into a home that will appreciate their high energy play style. Sophie is a love bug! From what we can tell, she is a cute little scruffy dachshund-chihuahua mix. Even though we don't know her back story because she was found as a stray and taken to a local shelter, we do know she seems to love everyone, both human and canine. Some dogs may not like her \"in your face\" style because she leans to her chihuahua side there! She loves her toys and playing with other dogs her size and age. She is still very much all puppy. She will require someone who is home. She loves sleeping in the big bed at night with her family pack. Sometimes it takes her a bit to settle down in bed or on the couch because she wants to play. She is not crate-trained and will need help with housetraining. She needs a securely fenced yard. As a potential adopter, you must have an excellent reference from your vet. ***Applicants must be willing to drive to Ellicott City, Maryland (10 miles south of Baltimore) to meet and adopt Sophie and Nina.****  Want to know more about Sophie? Email foster family at ann_donnawell@comcast.net.  Go to www.drna.org to fill out an adoption application.",

            "description": "Buddy is a high energy dog and it is suggested an experienced handler adopt him.  He is playful and affectionate, always asking for pets.  Buddy likes to be around people.  He knows his basic commands like sit, down and leave it.  He is still working on his stay.  He is leash trained, but he needs a firm hand when walking.  Try to avoid other dogs if possible.  He tends to want to run up to them and will bark to try and get his way. He is good about  coming when called and he is trained to come from a whistle blow.  If he sees something that excites he he might try to chase it and will ignore any recall commands, including the whistle.  Buddy is also kennel trained and eats everyday in his kennel.  The kennel will be provided for the adoption.\n\nBuddy is a nervous dog.  He cowers and usually runs to his safe space, his kennel when he hears loud shouts or noises.  Usually a high pitched play sounds or words will get him settled.  He is very playful, but this can be a source of behavior issues as well.  He expresses his playfulness with nips to the hands or bottom and through jumping.  A firm and deep OFF and NO will help in communicating he is not to jump ON you, but he will continue to jump.  Getting him to sit to receive pets is the best way to stop the jumping, though it is not s surefire method.\n\nhe is up to date on his shots and has his rabies tags.  He is currently using a Seresto flea and tick collar.\n\n**Please note these puppies are in foster care, and NOT at our facility during open hours.

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Arya.\n\nArya was picked up off the streets by a Good Samaritan. She was wondering with a male, Heath, and was pregnant, surprise! Her mothering duties are over and she is ready to be the baby now.\n\nArya is young and playful, plays well with other dogs (though she will pick a favorite toy and will sternly correct anyone who tries to play with it). No cats, and older kids would be ok. She is a high energy dog who needs a high energy owner/ family who will meet her needs.\n\n...........................\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!",

            "description": "SPECIAL COVID NOTICE: We realize that many of you are home from work right now and adopting a dog seems like a great idea. Which, it may be! Or may not. Please think about what your life will be like once things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d Will you have enough time each day to dedicate to a dog, based on the dog\u2019s individual needs? If you are looking for a dog to socialize with kids, other dogs, etc., please do not submit an adoption application, as we do not recommend that for any dog. Nor do we recommend dog parks or dog daycare. Visit the resources section of our website for more info on those topics.\n\nPlease note that none of our foster homes have children, so we have no idea how any of our dogs would do living in a home with kids and/or if they would enjoy it. None of our foster homes have cats either, so if you have a cat and are looking to adopt a dog, we can send you info for slow introductions which will require separating a dog from your cat for some time.\n\nAs for Nina:\n\nNina is approx. a year and a half old and is still very much a puppy. She is a very sweet, happy girl who greets new people with excitement and exuberance \u2013 sometimes a bit too much in the forms of jumping. Unfortunately Nina has spent much of her life in a shelter, hence the puppy-ness she still has in a big, strong dog\u2019s body. Nina loves to learn and picks up on commands quickly and will need an adopter to help her continue to learn how to be the best dog she can be. Cautious at times and exuberant at other times; Nina is very much still a puppy. A sweet, GORGEOUS puppy. Everyone who meets her can\u2019t get over at how stunning she is!\n\nNina does seem to have general anxiety about new places and new situations so would do best in a quiet home with a fenced yard. She goes for walks sometimes, but does best when they are in quiet, peaceful areas and not too long or frequent. At home, Nina needs close supervision, as she will get herself into trouble when she is feeling anxious (i.e. chewing things she should not).\n\nNina has really come a long way since joining our rescue and has proven that she can also relax and lounge around. In fact, Nina is happiest doing just that \u2013 hanging out with her family at home. She isn\u2019t the kind of dog who is up for big adventures and really doesn\u2019t require much exercise in terms of long walks or lots of outdoor time. Instead, she is happy to hang around the house with you.\n\nPlease note that the first step in our process is the adoption application found on our website www.midatlanticbullybuddies.org. Nina is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, microchipped and vaccinated.",

            "description": "Zoey is about 4 years old and is a total ball hound! She is perfectly happy to play fetch with you all day. She is a great 'alert dog' and will let you know if any people or creatures come her way. She is doing great with her training, and has done well making some new dog friends, though she is picky about who she likes. She is house, crate and leash trained. Not good with cats. Adult-only home preferred. \n\nZoey was removed from her former home and taken to a local shelter. She was skin and bones...and pregnant! She gave birth to three puppies at the shelter and was able to nurse them until they were weaned. A rescue pulled the puppies, but not Zoey. She was able to regain her physical condition and is healthy now.\n\nWhen she came to us, we discovered that in addition to not being fed properly, poor Zoey had not been well socialized. She was scared of humans at first, but after lots of work with her trainer, she is doing much better. She likes to meet humans slowly, on her terms, until she realizes there is nothing to fear and ball-playing to be had! With humans she trusts, she will stick to them like glue and is ready to run and play and have adventures. \n\nZoey was originally failed by humans. She not given a chance to be a normal dog, was starved and likely faced hardships we will never know about. Then she ended up pregnant, at a shelter, scared and confused. Now, many volunteers and caregivers have been working hard to give her a second chance at life. She deserves a chance to know love!",

            "description": "Gloria is an absolutely darling dog who is very friendly and sweet. She gets along very well with her large dog friends: one a male, the other an older dominate female. However, she would thrive best as an only dog or with a larger male dog companion as when stressed or over excited, she acts like a terrier. The dogs that she lives with are very non reactive and this helps keep her calm. \n\nAnd calm is her general state. She plays with toys in her yard by herself and occasionally gets the zoomies. Mostly, she finds soft things and takes naps. The comings and goings of an active household do not bother her but she is very interested with dogs and people outside of her yard. \n\nShe is very striking with her blue eyes and white fur. As a white dog, Gloria can have sensitive skin and her skin would easily burn if she spent too much time in full sun as her coat is very short. Her activity level is relatively low for a dog as young as she is. She gets excited for a walk or a greeting. But even that, she is fairly mild mannered but likes to wiggle. She is very watchful in her backyard and out her window. \n\nGloria is terrified of thunderstorms and shakes. She would like to snuggle close to her humans when there are storms. She is very very people oriented. She is a lovebug and snuggler. \nGloria is not a dog park dog because she is selective with other dogs. \n\nGloria will need a high fence as she can jump a low fence. \n\nIf you are interested in smiling Gloria, please fill out a pre adoption form on our website www.dogwoodfarmsanctuary.com or click on the adoption application link on our information page. We will not adopt Gloria into a home within jurisdictions that have a \"no pit bull\" ordinance as she might fit that category.",

Her favorite thing to do is to curl up and take a nice long nap in the sun. She does have some \u201cquirks\u201d and it will take a very special person to care for her. She needs someone who is calm, patient and knowledgeable about resource guarding/behavioral issues. Peanut also needs to be in a kid free home, preferably with no other dogs. Once she chooses you as her \u201cperson\u201d, you will be her entire world! She is potty trained and crate trained.\n\nPeanut will be lovingly moved to the right family with no fee, and with the offer to continue with her pet insurance paid in full. We think the best home for her would be with a person who wants that one, loyal companion. \n\nIf that is you, please let us know! Please complete our pre-adoption application. You can find that on our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com \n\nIf you have problems finding the app, please email us at starfishadoptions@gmail.com and we will be glad to help.",

YOU MUST MEET QUALIFICATIONS TO ADOPT.\n\nJack Jack has had a rough past and takes his time getting to know people.\nSince Jack Jack threatens to bite, he needs a special someone who understands fear aggressive dogs and is willing to work with him to gain his trust, most likely with the assistance of a trainer as he also feels threatened when meeting new people.\nJack Jack is good with other dogs, but he does play pretty rough with his doggy siblings. Kids are quite chaotic for him so he will need an adult only household. Also, no cats for Jack Jack. He weighs about 15 pounds, is approximately 2 years old, crate trained, and house broken. We are requiring a secure minimum 6-ft. fenced-in yard for him because he is a climber. If you think you have the perfect home for Jack Jack, we'd love to find out more about you. We are requiring JackJack's adopter to reside in the greater Orlando area. Please fill in our adoption application and we'll see if you're Jack Jack's perfect match. Make sure to include the experience you have had with a fear aggressive dog.",

Sassy is housebroken and crate-trained, though doesn't need the crate as she isn't destructive at all, and she would really love another dog or two to play with - despite her age, she is quite active and my older dogs aren't exciting enough for her! She also LOVES chewies and they keep her busy for awhile! Sassy is great on a leash and loves to explore, and being a very intelligent breed, definitely needs some mental stimulation but she is a VERY well-behaved girly! Sassy is only about 25 lbs. and easy to pick up and put on your lap if she doesn't jump up first!All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble.

Aruka is sometimes nervous in new places, but is very resilient and overcomes this quickly.\n\nAruka has been cat tested and is inquisitive but doesn't push limits. Dog savvy cats preferred; Aruka reacts appropriately to correction from cats. Aruka enjoys being with and playing with other dogs. Aruka has a medium energy level; he enjoys playtime with his canine friends and humans but can settle down as well. Aruka loves a good full speed run in the yard! He is very Velcro and will insist on being with you whenever you are home. He prefers to be with another living thing be it human or canine. Aruka never meets a stranger and will likely do well with children. He isn't big on playing with toys but does enjoy interacting with people. Aruka does well on leash but can be unsure in new places.\n\nAruka is deaf and likely has some vision impairment in bright sunlight, but not enough that you would recognize it as impairment. Aruka needs a home with a fenced yard (in his past home he was able to escape a 4 foot fence). However, he was housed outside without human company in those cases. He has shown no interest in escaping at this foster home, instead he asks to come inside. Because Aruka is deaf, a fence is required. \n\nAruka is fostered in Wichita, KS.\nAruka is fostered in Wichita, KS.\n\nTo apply to adopt visit www.ns4ar.org",

He's best with no young children. Henry is 6 years old and is really looking for a foster or forever home ASAP! The shelter is stressful and Henry prefers peace and quiet.\n\nFor more info please email dogs@illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net  or fill out the adoption application found at www.illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net.  The application does not commit you to adopting, just helps us find the dog that is the right fit for your family. We do not have open adoption hours due to COVID-19 so an application must be submitted and approved before we set up an appointment for you to meet any of our dogs! It can take up to a week for the Adoption Board to review applications and upon approval will contact you.\n\nAdoption fees are $250 which includes spay or neuter, vaccines- rabies, distemper and bordotella, AVID microchip and county rabies tag.  Seniors- over 8 fee is $125.",

            "description": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m Simbad and I am around 2 years old.  They tell me I am a very special boy that has lots of goofy energy. I need a future home that will be able to channel my energy into a consistent routine so that I can thrive and show you my best self! I am mostly house broken just working on fine tuning it. I do really well in my crate when I can see my humans to make sure they\u2019re still there, but still working on how to be quieter when I\u2019m in my crate and the humans leave. I pull quite a bit they tell me when I\u2019m on a leash, but can you blame me? With all my energy I just want to go go go! \n\nI do okay with other dogs although I have a strong personality and come on strong and I like to play rough. So my future home would have to have a dog that has my same play style or else I would be fine as an only dog as long as my future humans want to play play play! Since I have such a strong, silly, and high energy personality I will need a future home with older kiddos (high school age or older) or no kids at all. Just gotta make sure I don\u2019t accidentally knock anyone over! \n\nI\u2019m still working on my manners, but once I trust you and better understand my new environment I will show you just how smart I am (especially if there\u2019s treats involved). One thing I am really good at is staying in place when told to do so! \n\nMy favorite things are getting pets, eating treats, playing with balls, and running as fast as I can! I get told a lot that I am super cute and loving, but just need to figure out where to put all my energy! I am just hoping I can find a special forever family for my special personality. \n\nAdoption fee is $325\nApply at www.HuskyhavenFl.org",

Vinnie is an intense dog (as you can imagine with those breeds) and needs someone familiar with the Shepherd family.  He is ok with other dogs although can be a bit too intense for most.  He will need careful intros to make sure Vinnie doesn't get himself into trouble.  He is not safe with cats.  Vinnie is good with humans but is very \"one person.\"  He is not aggressive with strangers but is quite aloof.  He will bond hard and fast with his human!  Vinnie is crate trained, seems to be house trained and has nice manners.  He would not  be suited for a \"family\" life but needs an active human who is interested in training, running and dog sports.\n\nAdoption fee: $300\nBirthday: 1/2018\nWeight: 45 lbs.",

Rumi is crate trained, potty trained, and walks well on the leash. He seeks a home with one or two other playful four legged companions. It is a requirement. He also does not mind the felines. Rumi isnot your average lab, and he will take a patient owner to give him the necessary structure to feel safe. If your looking for a dog to cuddle, he is not the one.

He is potty trained, vetted, neutered and up to date on shots.Helikes riding in the car, finds the doggie bed he likes the best and goes to sleep. Helearned the doggie doorquickly butdoes not like the crate and will make his displeasure very loud. He starts out at night sleeping in a doggie bed in the chair next to me, and during the night sneaks past the other chis to slip under the covers and snuggle. He is a real sweetheart, so even with being a senior and a few health problems he would love his own home and someone to love him forever. Whenit is time to eat, he gets a little impatient and will stare and you and stomp his little left foot at you.\n\nMax has a condition called CHF, which is not serious but does require regular medication. A potential adopted can expect to pay about $35 per month for his meds.\n\nif interested please apply at savinghoperescue.org",

Shes potty trained and loves to be outside and will let you know when she has to potty by going to the back door and standing by it and scratches it when shes ready to come in she will scratch the door as well. All she wants to do is be loved on and cuddle with when she wants attention she rolls over or scratches you hand with her paw. She will also let you know when its dinner time by making cute little rumbling noises. If you cant ever find her you can count on her being underneath a blanket somewhere in the house. Shes not good with kids and shes very protective of her owner and owners items. Shes a very sweet lady and you can tell she just wants to make you happy.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact.

            "description": "Do you need your kids to eat their veggies? Well Tarzan will show them how! This veggie loving boy has been patiently waiting for a family to chose him. Could that be you? \n\nMeet Tarzan. He is a 10 year old chi mix who enjoys sitting outside, basking in the sun while reflecting on his previous adventures of chasing cats and raisin' hell with Jane. His friends call him \"The Boss\" and his enemies might say that he has small man syndrome. Although his body is old, he has the spirit of a young (but small) mountain lion. \n\nA true leader and a go getter who's in bed by 9:00pm on the dot.Tarzan is looking for someone who enjoys letting him be and occasionally dressing him up for a photoshoot. He says that it makes him feel young again. \n\nAll jokes aside, Tarzan is a sweet little guy who is looking for someone to love on him. He has no health issues besides some minor arthritis. He gets along with small dogs and husbands alike. And he knows how to use a doggie door! This boy also knows how to appreciate a good spa day and always gets a stellar behavior report from the groomer. \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquiry about a dog, please first fill out an application at savinghoperescue.org. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

I will be near you as much as I can because I am a snuggle-bug, or so my foster mom says. I am a good girl and that is house and crate trained. Chew toys are a must because I am still young. I need a calm and patient home as I have been through a lot and get scared easily and should be the only pet. I really want a furever home and family and would be so good.\n\nIf interested please apply at savinghoperescue.org. We are not able to get to all inquiries but do respond to all applications.

            "description": "Hi! my name is Bernard. I am a 3 year old terrier mix at 45 lbs. I am a very sweet and handsome boy. I do well with other high energy dogs. I would do best in a home with another dog my size to play with, but do require a dog meet and greet before leaving! I love walks and golf cart rides. I would do best in a home without children. My adoption fee of $200.00 includes my neuter surgery, deworming, microchip, and up-to-date vaccinations. \n\nBernard was originally a stray. He lived in a garage for a month before moving to a home where he was in a crate 15 hours a day. He is good in a crate and he loves car rides. He is treat motivated and once he trusts you he does really well. He does need an attached fenced in back yard for play time and exercise. \n\nMy adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a good fit. I appreciate your patience as the Adoption team discusses your application with my case managers!\n\nI've even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? If you'd like to meet me, please fill out an online application or email adopt@pawmettolifeline.org.",

I am a goofy girl that will make it my mission to make your day. I am a girl with a lot of energy but don't get me wrong - I LOVE a good cuddle on the sofa! I would do best in a home with no small children or animals, I don't know my own size! I have been tested with other dogs my size - I am friends with some and with others I am just uninterested - so please bring your (large breed) pup to meet me before adopting!\n\n\nI am currently in a foster home.\n\nI've even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for?

I am 9 months old and 29 lbs - meaning I'm the perfect medium size for you! \n\nMy foster mom says I am intelligent, inquisitive, and playful. I love to sunbathe, lay my head on your chest, and zoom around the house. I know my name and know to go to the back door when it is potty time. I know commands and will show them off to get treats from my family. \n\nI have anxiety about new people, places, and commotion on walks or in the house. I am extremely nervous and shy around people I don't know, but once you gain my trust (slowly but surely), I will come around. I am comfortable in the home setting but walks and having guests over stresses me out. I would do best in a calm home without children. I need an adopter who is willing to work with me long term to help me through my anxiety and nervousness. I need an adopter with patience and understanding for my under socialized past and how it can affect my day-to-day life. If we move at my pace, we will make leaps and bounds! I am good with other dogs and would love having an adult dog around to show me the ropes and help me be more confident!\n\nMy adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a BEST MATCH! I appreciate your patience as the Adoption team discusses your application with my case managers!\n\nIf you'd like to meet me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org, and an adoption advocate will be with you shortly. Thank you!",

Notice how I'm always look dressed to the 9's with natural eyeliner under my eyes. Oh yeah, I love treats!\n\nI've been looking for a family of my own for nearly a year and a half. I need a confident dog owner with experience in owning a dog as clever as I am. I'm a fast learner though, so just give me your time, patience, and love, and I'll be a great addition to your family. By the way, I already know the sit command. I am a marathon chewer with my toys so I'd prefer hard, tough chew toys. And who needs a fluffy bed? Not me! Give me a basic blanket and I am set! Do you have a cozy floor calling my name? All I need is you.\n\nMy adoption fee of $200.00 includes spay surgery, deworming, microchip, up-to-date vaccinations, and heartworm test. I've even started monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? If you'd like to meet me, please fill out an online application, call an advocate at (803) 465-9170, or email adopt@pawmettolifeline.org.",

He would be best as the only pet in the home and because of his size it would be best to have a home with no small children. Bobo knows his commands and he is both crate and house trained.

Wilma is one of the sweetest girls who loves to roll over for belly rubs and promises to give you tons of kisses. She is a bit worried when meeting men and will hide behind her person but once she knows that you aren't going to hurt her then she slowly warms up. Wilma was rescued from abuse with another dog but we would prefer that she goes to a home with no other animals at this time. She is fully crate trained, house trained, walks well on a leash, loves to play fetch and loves treats! Please consider giving this princess a forever home where she will get lots of treats, love and cuddles.

I am very independent but also seek attention by trying to nuzzle my way in for a pet or a snuggle. I'll paw you for affection. I am potty trained and will alert with a quiet bark when I want to go out or come back in. I have a very easy-going temperament. I will follow my brother anywhere. I know and respond to many basic commands. \n\nAlthough initially crate trained, I have been trustworthy enough to be able to roam free. For the last 5 years I've been living with a family, but my protective instincts have proven too much. My new adoptive family will need to be patient with me as I learn to trust strangers and intruders to my yard and home. I have not spent much time on a leash as my former home gave me lots of space to roam and exercise. I ride great in a car and will jump right in. I love to hang out near the kitchen, just hoping to sneak a bite to eat when no one is looking. I am trained on an invisible fence and I like to lay in the sunshine wherever I can find it. I put myself to bed. After a long day, you'll find me snuggled in my bed, in my room, where I'll sleep soundly all night without a peep. I am a gentle dog who loves being loved on. Due to my protective nature, an adult-only household is what I require. \n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about us on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/\n \nAdoption fee: $725 (adoption fee for Rita and Reid together)\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab at JRsPupsNStuff.org. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n \nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

With her breed combination, this girl is a natural protector. She is also an alpha dog and prefers to be in charge of any other dogs in the house. She may be fine with submissive dogs, but will do best as an only dog.\n\nBertha's ideal home will be with adult only, strong, confident handlers who understand her breed and natural desire to protect. They will understand her need to have boundaries and continued stimulation, both mentally and physically. A quiet home without a large number of visitors will be best. Although she can be wonderful with children, children bring activity and friends and Bertha may not understand she needs to share her children.\n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297.\n\nAdoption fee: $450.00\n\nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit.

Anja is very food motivated and very smart. She knows sit, her name, touch, down, spin, sit pretty, and loves walking on a leash.

            "description": "Hello! My name is Astro and I would like to tell you a little about myself...\n\nI am a very shy and scared pup, but my foster mom says I am doing really well and working hard to not be so afraid anymore. My favorite place in the house is anywhere my foster mom is! I love to follow her everywhere and also hang with all the resident pups and see what they're doing! One of my favorite things to do is to hoard toys, hide under a bed and rip them to pieces. I don't mind laying in a crate, as long as the door stays open, but my foster mom says I'm such a good boy that I don't need to be crated, so it's ok! I get along great with all the dogs in the house, and even the cats who I like to sniff and even give kisses. I sleep thru the night on a doggy bed next to my foster moms bed, and sometimes I even like to crawl under the bed to sleep. I'm still very scared of loud noises and new people, especially men, so my ideal family would consist of more women than men. I've spent almost my entire life in rescue, and I'm not really sure what happened before I was rescued, but my foster mom says it was probably scary! :( I'm very nervous on walks, and people and kids playing outside are also pretty scary to me, but I'm doing a lot better now and actually get excited about going for walks! I would love a home where my family has time to work with me and train me, and my foster mom says I have the funniest zoomies she's ever seen, and that I'd be amazing at agility training because I remind her of Tigger the Tiger cuz I love to bounce! lol! And besides, agility training really helps scared dogs gain confidence! :) \n\nSo here's a recap of my perfect home:\n* More girls than boys \n* A confident resident dog \n* A fenced in yard so that I can do my daily zoomies\n* Lots of training, agility training would be a huge bonus :)\n* A family who has time for lots of snuggles, and kisses, and who likes to give belly rubs is a must!\n* Patience! It might take me days, or weeks to get comfortable in my new home, so my family will need to be patient about this.\n* LOVE - Because if I have this it will help with all of the above :)\n\n I sure hope I find you soon!!! \n\nSincerely, Astro\n\nAdoption fee: $400.00\n\nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit.

She has lived with dogs but we do not know about cats. She is very shy and takes some time to warm up to new people. Lady would do best with a fenced in yard as she still needs to learn how to walk in a leash. She has never had to wear a collar or been leashed and this is all very new to her. Please call to talk with staff about her and you can schedule an appointment for you to meet her.",

This guy is for the most part a laid back guy and is looking for a family to match his personality of life of the quieter side. The only time this guy shows his puppy side is when it's time to play with some toys. Blaine loves any toys that are made for the super chewers so he can have them for awhile. Blaine's ideal family would be older adolescents and adults with him being the only pet!! He is a very well behaved guy and just wants to prove that he can be the best boy you have ever met. He loves to go on leisurely walks and walks excellent on a leash. Once home Blaine is ready to veg out on the couch and watch all your favorite shows while getting some much needed one on one time. If you think you can be the hero that Blaine is looking for schedule a visit to stop in and apply today!!!",

Meet Tahoe, a three year old Lab/Pit mix that is ready to be your loyal companion but it will have to be earned. He can be unsure of new people and will require someone that is ready to come and hang out with him a few times before going home. Tahoe has a very large personality and will need to be the only pet in his new home, prefers a low traffic environment and the company of adults and older teens. Once he knows you are his friend this guy turns into the most loving and loyal guy that anyone can ask for. Sometimes Tahoe forgets just how big he is and will be in your lap for lots of love and affection. He is very playful and loves to run around a fenced in yard playing with toys. Tahoe will need a single family home with preferably a fenced in yard to be living his best life!! If you think that Tahoe will be a perfect fit in your home and heart apply today to come in and meet this handsome guy!!!",

He had a rough start and has learned that is his past is his past and he is over it. He is a tripod and does well on his own playing in the yard (he will rest frequently) and house though needs the help of a wheelchair when walking around the block or on long walks. \n\nBruce's foster loves how excited he gets when he knows treats are coming! He has a joyful spirit. He is not a hyper dog and loves to just be close to his people. The silly dog will flop on his bed and let out a big sigh like it is the best moment of his day. *love* Did we mention how much he enjoys belly scratches and ears rubbed.\n\nBruce is a bit leary of strangers so needs slow introductions to get to trust people. He would also thrive in a household that is calm and chill.\n\nContact adopt@pflugervillepetsalive.org to meet Bruce!",

            "description": "8 years old, needs to be only pet, needs to be with someone that works from home or can take him to work. \nHi there! I'm Drax. I'm about 8 years old and it has been a crazy 8 years so far. I used to live in a backyard, chained to a tree and used solely for breeding. You would think that all of that would have broken my spirit, but no way! I'm still as sweet as can be. I'm selective about the dog company that I keep, I've gotten along with most dogs smaller than me. I don't like larger dogs, mainly I prefer to live in a home where I'm the only dog. I don't want to live with cats or other small critters that I might mistake for prey. After years of living chained up and alone, I have a little bit of what the doctor's call, \"separation anxiety,\" so I prefer to be with my human all the time. I would love to find someone who works from home or can take me to work with them. I love to play with toys or hang out in yard when it is nice outside. I'm also great on leash. I'm really just a big teddy bear that wants all the love and cuddles! I would love to find my special forever home, could that be you?? Fill out an adoption application at www.bellaspca.org if you'd like to meet me and the Bella people will set it up! Better yet, you meet Drax at the Bella Adoption Center at 10374 S. Coltrane Rd.

Wally came in as a stray with old wounds/scarring covering his ears, face, and legs. We don't know what he's been through, but we're glad he ended up with us where he's safe and loved! This guy is understandably a bit nervous with new people so he's looking for an adult only home with dog experience to help him through his nerves and to continue with training. We're also recommending he be a solo pet, but don't you worry! Wally has more than enough love to give to his perfect match!

While Ella reacts aggressively (barking and lunging) at new people, she does eventually warm-up with slow walks around the property and treats. Ella needs an experienced bully owner who can continue working with her in the home and help her build confidence. \n\n\nShe is spayed, up-to-date on her shots and microchipped. \n\nElla is ready to find her special family and if you think that may be you, please email Vicki@nokillarc.org or call (570) 784-3669.\n*Please allow at least 24 hours for all responses.",

            "description": "Caramel is a 4 year old Thai Ridgeback mix. Caramel was originally adopted from a local rescue who actually got her from Thailand! But ultimately she was surrendered to us due to behavior issues. From what we understand, it seems as though she did not receive the proper guidance and training she needed to be a social, balanced dog. Caramel has lots of buddies at the shelter and here are some of the great things they had to say about her: Caramel is treat motivated, and knows the commands \"sit\", \"down\" and \"paw\". She loves attention from her people, but does take time to warm up to new people. She walks well on leash and loves to play in the yard, and play fetch. Caramel wants to please you, and once she loves you, just the sound of your voice makes her happy. Sadly, Caramel flinches when she hears loud noises, even strong wind may scare her. We are very sad to see her here, and want to see her back in a home as fast as possible. Caramel's ideal home is with someone who will provide her with the proper structure so she can thrive. She will also need a solo dog home. If you are interested: Please call for more information: 516-785-5220, visit us at: 3320 Beltagh Avenue, Wantagh NY 11793 or email us: adoption@tohmail.org",

            "description": "Pinto was found as a stray in October 2017, making him one of our top 10 longest residents. He was found on someone's property and followed the home owner inside her home. (Heart breaking, we know). With slow intros with other dogs, Pinto will feel comfortable, but he doesn't appreciate overly pushy dogs! Pinto is though, a very insecure and nervous dog. Pinto's ideal home is with a savvy owner who has experience with guarding. During his stay at the shelter, we have been working on loose leash walking and commands like \"place\", \"sit\" and \"down\". If you are interested in Pinto, please contact our placement team:\n\nThe shelter is currently closed to the public, but is operating by appointment only for our placement services. \n\nT: (516)785-5220\nE: Adoption@tohmail.org\nE: Foster@tohmail.org\nE: Rescue@tohmail.org",

            "description": "Buster is our extremely handsome 7 1/2 year old boy who came to us as an owner surrender in April 2018. Buster was originally found as a tiny, adorable, 4 month old puppy, under a car in Brooklyn. Buster lived in the same home until being surrendered to us at the age of about 5. Buster is one of our top 10 longest residents and has been waiting too long for his chance at a forever home, and we hate to see him day after day here at the shelter, and know that his family is out there somewhere. Buster was extremely stressed in the kennels, but thankfully an office spot opened up and Buster was chosen to be the next office dog! We are so happy to report that Buster is soooo much calmer now that he is out of the kennels, and with people for most of the day. Buster is an absolute joy to be with. He is cuddly, he is sweet, he is calm, he is house trained, he is crate trained, he is affectionate, he gives kisses, and he gives paw!! You know what's even better?? Buster LOVES playing with other high energy large dogs! Buster is wary of new people so he will need slow and multiple meet and greets with his potential new family. He is reactive on leash (with almost everything that moves), so someone who can work with him on that is a must. Buster's ideal home is a low traffic adult only household with a large tolerant, but playful dog. No small dogs or cats. A fenced in yard would also be ideal for Buster as he loves to run, play outside and walking him can sometimes be challenging due to his reactivity. Buster truly is a love, he just needs someone to give him a chance.\n\nIf would like to inquire about Buster, please contact our placement team at:\n\nT: (516)785-5220\n: adoption@tohmail.org\n:foster@tohmail.org\n: rescue@tohmail.org",

            "description": "Do you know how hard it is for a black dog to get noticed in a busy shelter? It's not easy, let's just put it that way. Well, Bud is another black dog at the shelter, who came to us as an owner surrender when he was just 10 months old. His owner was going through medical issues and wasn't able to care for him, but two months later, they were able to reclaim him. Sadly, fast forward another two months, and Bud was returned again. This time, for behavior issues in the home. Bud is now 3 years old and has been with us for the last 2 years! Bud appreciates time to adapt to new places and would feel most comfortable in a quiet home. Bud will thrive in a home where he can be the only pet and have all your attention. A home with a yard would be a dream come true for this boy. He would love to join an adult home with an experienced adopter. His shelter buddy describes him as dignified and curious, and he lights up when he sees the people he knows. He's playful and entertaining when he's comfortable with you and will be your best friend once he's comfortable. We know Bud's perfect home is out there, could it be you?\nThe shelter is currently closed to the public, but is operating by appointment only for our placement services. If would like to inquire about any of our animals please contact our placement team at:\n\nT:(516)785-5220\nE: adoption@tohmail.org\nE:foster@tohmail.org\nE: rescue@tohmail.org",

His owner passed away after having him since he was a puppy and his owners family took him in, but ultimately only could care for him for a short while. We were told that poor Azul lived outside and never lived inside the house. Azul ended up with us and was very nervous in the beginning, but has really grown comfortable and become a staff favorite! He loves other dogs; so much so that he is regularly in play groups and helps our behavior team to dog test new dogs! Azul is a laid back dude who needs time to warm up. He walks great on leash, knows commands, and even passed his cat test here at the shelter!\n\nAzul is looking for a dog experienced, adult only, low traffic home to help him with his discomfort around new people and guarding behavior he has exhibited towards people and other animals. It is at our behavior departments discretion as to whether or not he will be homed with other animals due to his guarding behavior. \n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more, please contact our placement team: T: (516)785-5220 E: Adoption@tohmail.org E:Foster@tohmail.org E: Rescue@tohmail.org",

Blaire waited in the shelter a very long time, but thankfully, a foster home opened up and this is where Blaire is now. Foster homes are awesome because we get to know the dog's even better, and here's what we can tell you about Blaire: Blaire is house trained, crate trained and walks well on a harness. She is also very sweet and affectionate with her person. Blaire is the perfect combination of couch potato and \"mini-athlete\"! Blaire loves to run around in the yard, but also is really mellow inside. Blaire loves treats, attention, and to watch TV! Blaire does need a solo pet home, and a savvy owner, who can help her get used to new people as she can sometimes be scared when meeting new folks. Blaire is very petite and really, really sweet! Please help us find Blaire her forever home. \n\n\nIf would like to inquire about any of our animals please contact our placement team at:\n\nT: (516)785-5220\nE: Adoption@tohmail.org\nE: Foster@tohmail.org\nE: Rescue@tohmail.org",

Toro was found with a 15.7 lb pound collar and chain around his neck, tied to a fence, at an abandoned home. Thankfully, we removed them off their chains and brought them to safety. Toro is still waiting for his forever home, with someone who will give him structure, love, and patience. Toro is shy but super sweet and affectionate when he gets to know you. Toro is looking for an adult only home due to guarding he displayed in his last adoptive home. Toro was sadly never properly socialized and trained prior to coming to our shelter and possibly lived outside his entire life. It is very important to give Toro structure, have him crate trained and teach him basic obedience. Toro is recommended to be the only pet. We want to see this boy in a loving home, after all he's been through, he deserves the best.\n\nIf would like to inquire about any of our animals please contact our placement team at:\n\nT:(516)785-5220\nE: adoption@tohmail.org\nE:foster@tohmail.org\nE: rescue@tohmail.org",

Tucker is house trained, crate trained and knows a ton of different commands. Tucker is very sad to be here at the shelter and we would love to see Tucker thrive in a home. It is recommended that Tucker goes home to a one or two person household. His next adopter should be experienced with guarding and stranger reactivity. Hiring a trainer that specialize in behavior modification is highly recommended. Tucker would be best as a solo pet. We feel so awful for Tucker, but we know he must have someone out there who is for him. He's now been waiting since August 2018 but are still hopeful there is someone out there for him.

Ribbon is under-socialized with other dogs, so his ideal buddy would be an aloof or low-key friend. Ribbon loves treats and prefers to chill not cuddle. We know his family is out there, so we will continue to love on him while he is here, and hope his stay isn't too long!\n\nIf would like to inquire about any of our animals please contact our placement team at:\n\nT: (516)785-5220\nE: Adoption@tohmail.org\nE: Foster@tohmail.org\nE: Rescue@tohmail.org",

Yes, that's right. Brisket was found, on the side of the road, NOT tied up, next to his bag of food that was left with him. No owner came looking for him, not surprisingly, so this little meatball is now available for a home!! Brisket likes other dogs and is being recommended for a home with kids 17 and up due to guarding.

            "description": "Bear is our almost 3 years old, extra handsome boy who came to us as a stray in December 2019. Bear is interested in meeting other dogs, but doesn't like pushy behavior (who does?!). He displayed some discomfort with people near his food, so he is looking for a home with children 17 and older. Bear enjoys attention from people he trusts, and loves treats. He also knows the commands \"sit\", \"kennel up\", \"place\", \"paw\" and \"drop\". We want to see Bear in a loving home as fast as possible, as he is nervous here at the shelter. \n\nIt is highly recommended that Bear goes to a one or two person household. His next adopter should be experienced with guarding and stranger reactivity. Hiring a trainer that specializes in behavior modification is highly recommended. There is no history of Bear living with another dog but if he does go home to a household with another dog, he would do best with an aloof or low-key dog that can respect his space. No kitties for Bear. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more, please contact our placement team: \n\nT:(516)785-5220\n: adoption@tohmail.org\n:foster@tohmail.org\n: rescue@tohmail.org",

He is an independent boy who is happy to co-exist with you, but when he wants attention, he will sit in front of you so that you MUST scratch his neck. He loves to be in the back yard, but he will knock on the door to let you know when he wants to come back inside. Rico wants you to know that it is essential that his furever home be prepared to provide an endless supply of tennis balls, which must be thrown over and over again. He is living with two dogs and two cats in his foster home and gets along with everyone. He is house and kennel-trained. Rico, like most people, is a bit choosy about who he welcomes into his friend circle. He'd do best in a low traffic household where there are not a lot of new and different people coming and going or frequent social gatherings (current COVID circumstances excluded). He is a slow track adoption boy who will require multiple meet and greets with a potential adopter.\n\n\n\nI am currently in a foster home! Please email foster@kcpetproject.org for more information. Thank you!",

Please email KCPP's Canine Foster Manager, Foster@kcpetproject.org to get in contact with his foster family. \n\nNavajo is a Shepard mix with bounds of energy and a quirky personality. He enjoys being silly and playing around with his human friends. Navajo leads an active lifestyle and would be perfect for someone who enjoys walks or runs. He likes to pick and choose his friends, and prefers to be the only apple of your eye - therefore, we feel he would do best as the only animal in the home, and would benefit from a home without young children. He loves to play with his toys and is very good at chasing a ball. Navajo is crate trained, muzzle trained, and so far has done well adjusting from shelter life to life in a foster home. He likes to chase squirrels & loves to hog all the attention from his humans.\n\n\n\nI am currently in a foster home! Please email foster@kcpetproject.org to find out more information.",

This terrific 1 year old tail-wagger is spunky spirited, and full of playful energy. Scarlett will sit for snacks and is anxious to learn more. She's currently in a foster home and loves playing with toys, romping in the backyard with her four-legged friends, and taking walks. Scarlett will thrive with an active adopter and daily exercise. Her ideal home will include an energetic canine companion and requires a physically fenced yard. She does have some anxiety and is currently on a daily medication. This medication will need to be continued in her new home.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Scarlett, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Scarlett.\n\nScarlett\nAustralian Cattle Dog/Terrier mix\nFemale\nDOB: 6/9/2019\nWeight: 45 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

            "description": "Comico is out of this world! This happy faced hound is so handsome, one photo simply wasn't enough. At 4 years old, he's a beefy, blue & white babe who's tons of fun and always ready for action. Comico is a super sweet and stocky snuggle buddy, weighing in at 71 lbs. He's a smart cookie who knows some commands, but he's very strong and could use some help learning leash manners. He'll do best as an only pet, but may get along with a very submissive female dog. No cats for this cutie though! Comico is active, high energy, and will need a home with a physically fenced yard and a lifetime supply of jolly balls (he insisted that we include that). He loves humans of all ages, but may be too rowdy for small kiddos. Comico will be a super cool addition to any active home!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Comico, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Comico.\n\nComico\nPit Bull Terrier\nMale\nDOB: 3/2/2016\nWeight: 71 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

            "description": "Greeting Potential Senseis. I am Ronin, your most loyal student. My name in Japanese means masterless samurai warrior, and I am really looking to change the masterless part. Samurais live by a certain code, and I need to make sure that my future sensei understands my specific needs. First, because of past experiences I am suspicious of all newcomers. I will require you or any new people to take it slow. If you don't know how slow, I will make sure to remind you. Once you are in my circle of trust though, I absolutely will love to be your shadow and most trusted companion on our future journeys. Not only will I tell you how fast or slow to go, I am also good about communicating about when I need to use the restroom. My current foster sensei say that I am very good with my bathroom discipline. The key to be a good samurai is intelligence and boy am I smart. I figure out things quickly and if you change it, I will figure out the change just as quick. I will need a dojo in which I will continue to be challenged mentally to grow my skills. The perfect training/living space would also include a fenced in yard in which I can run and run. Previous senseis say I have potential to learn basic commands if the right teacher came around to give me good instructions. Please keep in mind the perfect environment for me to continue my training would be free of the distractions of small animals or children. During my time at my foster sensei's dojo, I have grown fond of popcorn, french fries, cheese, peanut butter, sausage, pizza, and more, so I will gladly help you on your quest to eat healthier by taking the junk food off of your hand. I also am the best snuggle companion on the couch. I look forward to meeting you!\n\nI am currently in a foster home! Please email: foster@kcpetproject.org to meet me!",

The staff has found me to be a playful and friendly gal. It's not known how I would do with other animals or children, so a meet and greet with another canine and the whole family would be in order. Because of my size and strength, I might be too much for small children. If you think you have the room and resources to care for me, let's get to know each other!",

I really enjoy my time outside running in the grass and would love a fenced in yard to romp and play in and I do like to go on walks, but I am not in it for the long haul. Shorter walks are all I need. If you think we might be a match please fill out an application to meet me soon! I would love to be home for the New Year!",

I am still a youngster at heart and could benefit from a little bit of training, and would need a home with a fenced in yard and no other dogs. I am shy at first but after spending a little time with you, I will shower you with kisses and love. Please come visit me soon, since Shelter life is hard on my sensitive nature.",

My favorite activities are going in the doggie pool and playing \"throw the ball\". I run fast for the ball and bring it back with a big smile on my face! I wouldn't be good in a home with cats because they're fun to chase too! I also wouldn't do well in a home with children under 15, or any other dogs. I walk well on leash, and my main character traits are that I am sweet and playful. I do need a fenced in yard, and continued training with not jumping up, but I'm eager to please. I really like to go for car rides and I'm quiet and polite in the car. My favorite trip is a ride to the Dairy Queen for a pup cone!",

Mario can only be seen by appointment: 651-772-8983**\n\nIf you love the great outdoors and are looking for a four legged friend to share your adventures with, I am the dog for you! I am a 4 year old Yellow Lab who is big, playful and high energy. I love the water, hiking, running, playing ball or just taking a car ride for a tasty treat. DQ has great hotdogs!! I am an independent guy and it takes a while to build trust, due to some separation anxiety and security issues. I may not be a cuddler but I could be a wonderful companion for an independent individual. I like other dogs, with the proper introduction. I walk well on leash and I enjoy jogging, but I can easily be distracted by a critter or another dog. I would need a home with a fenced in yard, and I am looking for someone who has the patience and ability to work on my training. Since I'm such a special boy, I can only be met with an approved adoption application. If you think I might be a good fit for you, please contact the shelter!",

I was picked up by St. Paul Animal Control and my owner was never found so I was transferred to Animal Ark. I can be a bit shy with new people so I would need some time to get to know you, but I am a sweet boy. I need to go to a home with a fenced in yard, with no children or small animals, and with someone who is willing to teach me how to be a well-mannered boy. I would also need a slow introduction to any potential canine siblings. I am very treat motivated and very smart. Since I'm such a special boy, I can only be met with an approved adoption application. If you think I might be a good fit for you, please contact the shelter!",

I am a very outgoing dog with a whole lotta personality! I really like going on walks with my volunteers and they say I do so well on leash. I enjoy playing and have lots of energy, so I would need a fenced in yard. Playing is always a fun way to burn off some of my energy! I am definitely a people kind of dog...I just love them! They give such good cuddles and I am a rock star at cuddling! Unfortunately I tend to forget my manners around children, so I will need a home without little ones. No kids under 16yrs of age please. If you are interested in meeting me, contact the shelter to ask how!",

            "description": "Harriet was a feral dog that was trapped in Stephen's State Forest along with 16 other feral dogs. The \"Forest Dogs\" are all learning to trust people. They have never been pet by a human prior to their capture or heard everyday sounds like the hum of a refrigerator, the tumbling of a dryer, or even the flush of a toilet. Everything is new to them. They require fenced yards because they are still learning to walk on leashes. We won't sugarcoat this...they are projects! If you have patience and a huge capacity to nurture and the ability to teach, please think about adopting or fostering one of these dogs. I can't begin to describe the joy you will feel watching dogs like these progress into happy, confident dogs. It is truly amazing to see the first tail wag, the first playful act with a toy, the first lick on your hand, and all of the little milestones that will touch your heart in a huge way. Please consider showing Harriet what a loving home is. Thank you!",

They can all be leashed and walked, although some of them have preferences in their people. These dogs are unlike any dogs you've met before, so please don't expect the normal you may be used to. \nEloise has come a long way in the last couple of years and finally began accepting touch. Today she's enjoying scratches/pets all over and even the coveted belly rub. She still has some issues to work through and such as loud noises. \nEloise is very much a diva! She was fostered for a few months and truly enjoyed the comforts of a home - she claimed multiple couches and beds. She did well with people and the confident male dog in the home, but didn't do so well with the resident females. \nIdeally, Eloise would thrive as an only dog once you have her trust, she will show you unconditional love. To be expected, she will require several meet and greets and patience in adapting to a new home. A secure physical fence is a must. \nIf you're patient and willing to give Eloise a chance, she would love to meet you! Bring treats!!",

He's a 2 year old American Bulldog mix. \n\nHe is smart, but stubborn so isn't as up to snuff on dog manners and tricks. He can sit and take a treat like a champ but loses interest pretty quickly after that. \nTyson runs well with other dogs outside, but may be best as an only dog as he is not keen on several of his roommates. \nTyson deserves a home with fenced yard so he can run, explore and soak up the sun. \nA patient, experienced dog family who can work on obedience and provide lots of love would be a great match for Tyson. He likes to lean in for scratches and thinks he's a lap dog most of the time.",

Polly Anne requires a fenced yard because she does not walk on a leash yet. We won't sugarcoat this...she is a project! If you have patience and a huge capacity to nurture and the ability to teach, please think about adopting Polly Anne. I can't begin to describe the joy you will feel watching dogs like these progress into happy, confident dogs. It is truly amazing to see the first tail wag, the first playful act with a toy, the first lick on your hand, and all of the little milestones that will touch your heart in a huge way. Please consider showing Polly Anne what a loving home is!",

Like my sister, I am shy because I am still getting use to people. Too much chaos does scare me, but if you come up to me slowly, talk to me and pet me, I will know I can trust you and I will feel at ease. I'd need a patient and loving home to guide me to my full potential. I am pretty lazy, and love lounging around, so it would be cool to find a family who could do that with me!",

They have never been pet by a human prior to their capture or heard everyday sounds like the hum of a refrigerator, the tumbling of a dryer, or even the flush of a toilet. Everything is new to them. They require fenced yards because they are still learning to walk on leashes. We won't sugarcoat this...they are projects! If you have patience and a huge capacity to nurture and the ability to teach, please think about adopting or fostering one of these dogs. I can't begin to describe the joy you will feel watching dogs like these progress into happy, confident dogs. It is truly amazing to see the first tail wag, the first playful act with a toy, the first lick on your hand, and all of the little milestones that will touch your heart in a huge way. Please consider showing Archie what a loving home is. Thank you!",

            "description": "Howard was a feral dog that was trapped in Stephen's State Forest along with 16 other feral dogs. The \"Forest Dogs\" are all learning to trust people. They have never been pet by a human prior to their capture or heard everyday sounds like the hum of a refrigerator, the tumbling of a dryer, or even the flush of a toilet. Everything is new to them. They require fenced yards because they are still learning to walk on leashes. We won't sugarcoat this...they are projects! If you have patience and a huge capacity to nurture and the ability to teach, please think about adopting or fostering one of these dogs. I can't begin to describe the joy you will feel watching dogs like these progress into happy, confident dogs. It is truly amazing to see the first tail wag, the first playful act with a toy, the first lick on your hand, and all of the little milestones that will touch your heart in a huge way. Please consider showing Howard what a loving home is. Thank you!",

Sienna requires a fenced yard because she does not walk on a leash yet. We won't sugarcoat this...she is a project! If you have patience and a huge capacity to nurture and the ability to teach, please think about adopting Sienna. I can't begin to describe the joy you will feel watching dogs like these progress into happy, confident dogs. It is truly amazing to see the first tail wag, the first playful act with a toy, the first lick on your hand, and all of the little milestones that will touch your heart in a huge way. Please consider showing Sienna what a loving home is. Thank you!",

They have never been pet by a human prior to their capture or heard everyday sounds like the hum of a refrigerator, the tumbling of a dryer, or even the flush of a toilet. Everything is new to them. They require fenced yards because they are still learning to walk on leashes. We won't sugarcoat this...they are projects! If you have patience and a huge capacity to nurture and the ability to teach, please think about adopting or fostering one of these dogs. I can't begin to describe the joy you will feel watching dogs like these progress into happy, confident dogs.

Lola has spent 593 days in a cage. \nWe are going to be honest, she shows absolutely terribly in a cage, because she's choosy with her people, she is not fond of men, and she needs to be the only animal in the home. \n\nDespite having said all of that, she is just as deserving of a life outside of a kennel as every other dog . \n\nThe young volunteer who took these photos and videos has never worked with Lola before . She warmed up to her instantly and Jess was kind enough to send us the proof of that interaction . \n\nLola wiggles her butt for her loved ones, rolls over for those who have gained her trust and is the perfect walking buddy. \nPerhaps if we could focus on her good qualities somebody will give her a chance? \n\nHer best adopter would be a woman, without young children , we recommend teens and up . We know she's complicated but most of the best pups start out a bit of a challenge! She is affectionate and loving once you have her trust and we know she could make someone the perfect pet!\n\nShe will make the right person very, very happy ! \nWww.griffinpondanimalshelter.com/adopt",

Likes dogs, though a meet and greet would be required. He is a rambunctious guy when he gets playing so you have to watch out he doesn't knock you over lol. Available for adoption at Griffin Pond Animal Shelter!\"\n\nYuri has been with us over a year. He came in with a pregnancy female and sge all all of the puppies were adopted. He seems to have faced the brunt of whatever happened on his past, because he doesn't instantly trust.\nHe is such a lover and would make amazing best friend to the right owner who would give him love at his own pace and allow him to see that humans aren't all the same.\n\nWe adore this big lug. \nTo meet him apply here :\nWww.griffinpondanimalshelter.com/adopt",

He's currently living in a foster home and we have learned so much about him during his stay - like once he gets to know you he's the cuddliest, kissiest pup around! To get there, he just needs a small amount of your time. He chooses his friends slower than some, but when he chooses you, it's for life!\n\nWhy should you adopt Smores? Here are a few things we love about him.\n- He's home life ready! He's got it all down. Housetraining, crate training, basic commands and a few fun extras too!\n- He's great with other dogs. He lives with two foster siblings who are sometimes a little grouchy, but he doesn't mind! \n- He's a total cuddlebug!\n- He's had expert training at Frogs to Dogs and is a day camp regular. He loves his trainers there and has learned so much. \n- He enjoys calm settings, quiet naps, and isn't one for a lot of commotion. He'll happily rest alone in his crate when he needs to! \n\nThis four-year-old, 45-pound pup is so ready to take the next step forward into his permanent home. Can you make his dreams come true?",

When I was younger, kids were not very nice to me, so I would rather just stick with adults taking care of me. The league staff and volunteers have been very good to me and have kept me mentally and physically stimulated, but I would love to know what a home is. And while they have been very good to me, I'm ready for a home to call my own. \nSo many of my friends have come and gone, and I've been here for over 4 years! Any idea how many days that is? Over 1500!\nYes I am older, and yes I have had a rough past, but I have matured a lot and have learned so much. I like my doggie friends and could probably even go home with one, IF it's the \"right\" one. I also like my people, but I will need you to be patient with me as strangers do scare me. \nWhat do you think? Is this too much to ask? Do you think you or someone you might know could be \"my one?\" All you have to do is check in with my trainer (donna@lfaw.org)! See, I'm that amazing that I have my very own trainer! Hope to see you soon!",

            "description": "5/1/13 Rubyanna is 2 1/2 yrs of age now. She loves to be with you and is often running and playing with the other dogs. She has the drive of a young dog and doesn't let her rubbery legs stop her from playing. She was put here for a special someone to love her. Ask her foster mom about Rubyanna and she'll tell you all about her. Perhaps she could be your new special companion.\n10/2012 Rubyanna is doing as well. Some days her legs do great and she plays with the other dogs. Other days her legs are a bit like rubber but she still wants to play. Is there someone special that would take Rubyanna into their homes/lives?\n12/15/11 Rubyanna is grown up now.. a year old and returned by her adoptive family. Rubyanna is active, would do best in a home with older kids and someone that would take time to teach her. Her prior owner returned her because she chewed the kids toys, and was too active for their small child. Rubyanna is one that is excited to see her human and has submissive pee accidents. Could you love our Rubyanna? Please come meet her at our adoptions.\n4/15/11 Meet RubyAnna. She is a great teen pup, approximately 4-5 months of age and weighs 22 lbs. She came from a high kill shelter and is happy to be in her foster home. RubyAnna was brought to a clinic with multiple puncture wounds. Her owner said she disciplined the dog hitting her with a board but wasn't aware the board had nails in it... Great start in life. RubyAnna is a character though.. she follows you like a shadow or your best friend. Her coat is black with chocolate highlights. She is actively looking for a new forever home. Please correspond on her behalf.\n\n**********************EMAILS ONLY FOR RUBYANNA***************\n\nLuv A Pet is a non profit rescue for orphaned/abandoned puppies and kittens.

She loves to go for long walks, play in the yard, hang out with her favorite people, swim, practice her tricks, sunbathe, and learn new things. Cornelia has been through a lot of training with her foster mom, including trick training. Not only is she skilled in basic obedience, she is also an advanced level trick dog with THREE trick dog titles. As if she couldn't get any cooler, she is also a fantastic swimmer and LOVES swimming! Cornelia is a fun, active girl but she also enjoys her down time, sleeping in, and cuddling with her people. Cornelia can be nervous around men and needs slow and proper introductions to new people. She loves other dogs and lives for playdates but she has never lived with another dog before so she would need time and a slow and proper introduction to a dog before she could live in a home with one. Cornelia would do best in a home with no small animals, including cats, and older, respectful children. Cornelia has her very own facebook page and is actually quite famous. If you'd like to see her in action, check her out at:",

His temporary foster said he is potty trained, crate trained, knows sit and wait, and is fine left alone. Bam Bam loves chasing toys and romping around. A volunteer said, \"Out in the yard, he engages me with cute play bows and he tries to climb in my lap when I sit on a bench. He listens well and is definitely focused on whoever is handling him.\" He's also dog friendly and loves playing with his canine friends. Bam Bam would love to be your man!

This makes her a great \"work from home\" dog as she will settle down whenever you sit down to work and stay settled until you get up. She loves to meet new people, and doesn't mind cats one bit. Once she's recharged with plenty of naps, Lexa loves to be outside! Her very favorite outdoor activities are lying in the sun getting a belly rub, light walks, fetching and playing tug of war. Lexa is also a big smart pants who has been a breeze to train with her love of treats. She knows sit, stay, place (aka go to bed) and crate! Doesn't Lexa sound like the most special pup?",
