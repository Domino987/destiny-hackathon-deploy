            "description": "Maggie is a 2 year old  who loves to run and would be a great running partner.  She runs with abandon, and will follow her pack wherever they wander. She loves people, other dogs, cats, and has been precious with her foster mom's toddler son and 92 year old mom. She is an indoor dog, coming inside with us, lazing about the living room, and sleeping at our feet when we go to bed. She's perfectly alert, will sound off a bark to warn of new noises or something approaching but she's never been aggressive in any way. She's been the most intelligent and loving companion dog. She's part Catahoula and (I believe) Beagle since she is inclined to chase squirrels and loves a good tree. She was treated for heartworm when young and has had flea/tick prophylaxis every month in our home. She sailed through obedience training, enjoys dog parks, has been a great dog on road trips, and is both house trained and crate trained. She had her right eye removed because of glaucoma and receives drops in the left eye twice daily. She's not a chewer but will occasionally tear up a water bottle or something plastic laying about. She'll make a great dog for literally anyone and everyone that meets her adores her.  Adoption fee is $175 it includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, rabies license, microchip, dewormer, heart worm preventative for the month, vet exam. Please go like our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/barkandroll . Follow us on instagram/twitter @barkandrollrc to see more pictures of me as well as other dogs in our rescue. You can access an adoption application on our website http://www.barkandrollrescuecompanions.com It usually take 1-2 days to complete the application process.",

He would love a forever home that would help him gain some weight.\n\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under \"Adopt a dog\"* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\n\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Copper is very wary of new people and needs a patient and understanding owner that will help him overcome his fear of strangers.

He has been neutered, given his rabies vaccine, and his boosters. So he is all ready to go!\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

They love long walks and long naps especially if you take a nap with them. They will wait for each other when walking and look for each other if they are in different rooms. Whishbone can be a little bit nervous and protective of Bailey but just needs a little bit of reassurance and attention and it will be fine. Bailey needs the scratches and will look for your attention and Wishbone will follow her on that. \n\nThey are nice to other dogs and new people but seem not to like cats. They are well leash and potty trained and prefer sleeping on the bed with us but also take naps on their own bed.",

She is not yet used to leash, however, she follows people.\n\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under \"Adopt a dog\"* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\n\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Our behavior coordinator Jeannie has been working closely with Blaze for months, and here are some reasons why he is her favorite dog at the shelter:\n\n\n\n\"Blaze is a beautiful hound dog with droopy ears! He is respectful and loyal to the humans he bonds with. If you take the time to get to know him, he will be your best friend. He walks great on a leash, learns commands quickly, and is so easy to train!\n\n\n\nIn his new home, Blaze would do his very best outdoors with lots of space to roam, and in the right environment, he would be the perfect working dog. He also LOVES to go for car rides. Blaze is a great dog, and he deserves a chance at the best life!\"\n\n---\n\nBlaze is a 5 year old neutered male Bloodhound Mix. He weighs about 102 lbs and is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE. His adoption fee is $0.To learn more about how our variable adoption fees are saving more lives than ever before, please visit: http://bit.do/SPAS_Adopt\n\n---\n\n*Regular adoption policies and procedures apply",

Good on leash, good with large male dogs - no small dogs or cats please! She's OK with older kids over age 13 preferably. Luna can work in an apt but may require crate-training at first. Luna would make a great walking or running partner because of her energetic energy level.\n\nLuna is up to date on shots, preventatives and HW negative. We will arrange a video chat with a motivated adopter so you can see how she behaves and interacts with our partner rescue in South Carolina. Luna's adopt donation is $175.\n\nIf you want to adopt Luna we will arrange transport with our trusted transport partner who will deliver door to door and provide an experienced dog intro to your home. Transport is a separate charge that is negotiated with our Transport person.\n\nPlease submit our adopt application -\nCOPY and PASTE our adopt application LINK into your browser:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/GFS_nj/ADOPT_FOSTER_Application\n\nWe will respond immediately!\n",

Shy dog experience is recommended as well as having another like size (preferably sheltie) companion in the home for her to emulate.

Stumpy is great with other dogs and kids! \n\nHe is in a foster home where he gets to hang out and watch TV. Yes, he likes to watch TV and hang out with his foster family.\n\nStumpy is a playful pup but also mellow - he likes to just be by his humans. We prefer to place him in a household with no young kids.\nFully vetted and ready for a family to give him his forever home. Could that be you?

This is a separate fee. Our transporter is a knowledgeable and experienced dog rescue advocate who will provide a one-on-one intro of Stumpy to your home,\n\nWe will contact you immediately!",

            "description": "Jack is a playful 5-year old Boxer/BullMastiff\u00a0mix. This handsome boy definitely has a way about him, and in the short time he has been with us, he has charmed his way into the hearts of our volunteers.\n\nJack loves to run and chase his toys in our dog park but his yellow ball is by far his favourite. It's very cute how much he loves his yellow ball! Always enthusiastic for an outing, Jack looks forward to his daily walks and he is very good on leash. He listens well and knows how to heel, sit, lie down and he will even roll over when asked. When he is relaxed and feels secure, Jack is a happy, fun and playful dog. He also loves car rides.\n\nJack is, however, fearful and uncertain when meeting new people, especially men. At the shelter, when in his kennel or outdoor pen, his tendency is to bark when approached by someone he does not know, but if you ignore him, and let him come to you, he settles down. It is important that visitors understand and respect this. Once he gets to know you and feels at ease, he is an affectionate, lovable, friendly and loyal dog who likes to be with people. Because of his fearfulness, Jack must be placed into a home with a dog savvy adopter who understands his needs and will help him build his confidence in a secure and stable environment. Jack should not live in a\u00a0home with children and he should be the only animal in the household. He isn\u2019t great with other dogs, especially dominant males but he doesn\u2019t seek out trouble and he can be walked with other dogs as long as the person at the other end of the leash is attentive and in control.\n\nBecause of his looks, breed specific legislation (BSL) may apply so before inquiring, please be sure that Jack is welcome in your town, city or municipality.",

He is good with childr, so would do better as only dog. Due to his size and energy level he needs to be with older children(16years and up).  He is an excited baby boy who loves to explore and play. He just wants lots of love and playtime. He would be a great goofy addition! :-)",

            "description": "Tess is a sweet loving girl that loves people and children!! Unfortunately she may be aggressive to certain dogs if she feels threatened. If exposed to other dogs she should be muzzled.  She loves being brushed, petted, going on car rides and simply soaking in the sun when it is nice outside. If we show her kittens she is very gentle but we aren't sure if she could be trusted with older cats, she is selective on the cats and dogs that she likes and dislikes so caution should be taken and she may do better as a only pet. Sweet Tess has been at the shelter since July 2020 and has been patiently waiting for her perfect family to find her, could you be the one?\n\nTess est une fille douce et aimante qui aime les gens et les enfants !! Malheureusement, elle peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s agressive envers certains chiens si elle se sent menac\u00e9e. Si elle est expos\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres chiens, elle doit \u00eatre musel\u00e9e. Elle adore se faire brosser, caresser, faire des promenades en voiture et simplement se baigner au soleil quand il fait beau dehors. Si nous lui montrons des chatons elle est tr\u00e8s douce mais nous ne savons pas si on peut lui faire confiance avec des chats plus \u00e2g\u00e9s. Elle est tr\u00e8s s\u00e9lective sur les chats et les chiens qu'elle aime et n'aime pas, alors il faut \u00eatre prudent. Elle pourrait faire mieux en tant que seule animal de compagnie. Notre belle Tess est au refuge depuis juillet 2020 et attend patiemment d'\u00eatre retrouv\u00e9e par sa famille parfaite , pourriez-vous \u00eatre celle-l\u00e0?",

(Well, maybe not the letter carrier.)\n\nHowever, I get on high alert when I see another dog, so you will need to avoid encounters when we are out walking. Someone trained me well, and I have perfect manners. My foster parents got me when I needed surgery for two fractures in a front leg, but that is all healed now\u2013thanks, SPCA!\u2013 and I enjoy running around in the yard playing keep-away, and taking several long walks each day. Frequent brushing keeps my coat looking good and manageable.\n\nIf you are seeking a close companion who will be your best friend and walking partner, and we can avoid other animals, I\u2019m your gal.\n\nPlease consult our ADOPTION FAQ (http://www.pgspca.org/adopt/frequently-asked-questions/)  before contacting us.  If you are viewing this listing on a site that is not Petfinder or Adoptapet, please check our main site: \nhttp://www.pgspca.org/adopt/adoptable-animals-2\nfor the most up-to-date information on this pet.\n\nIf you are interested in Layla, consider letting us know by filling out a (no-obligation) adoption application (http://www.pgspca.org/adopt/online-adoption-application/) and we will arrange a meeting.\nTo see if Layla will be attending the next adoption show, check here: http://www.pgspca.org/adopt/adoption-show-attendees/.\n\nNOTE: We are an all-volunteer group and do not operate a shelter.

She is wonderful with other dogs and enjoys any human she meets.  She was surrendered to us after a baby in the family had severe allergies to her.  Her previous family has had her since is was 8 weeks old, so we know for a fact what her breed is.  Mocha has wonderful house manners, LOVES to eat, she will gobble all of her food immediately.  She is currently in a foster home with dogs of all sizes, no crate is required but she does great in one.  Mocha loves to kick her heels up and run like the wind, seriously this girl is fast.  Which is why we are requiring her forever home to have a fenced in yard.  This girl is loyal, super affectionate, incredibly smart and most of all absolutely beautiful.  \n\nGive this gal a chance, she will win your heart over.  \n\nIf you are interested in adding Mocha to your family, please go to www.hcwdogrescue.com/adoptionapplication and complete an application.\n\n*Adoption Fee*\n$200.00 includes the following:  neuter, parasite free, rabies vaccination, DHLPP vaccination, Bordetella vaccination, microchip, heartworm negative and current on prevention.\n\nThanks for choosing adoption!!!!",

All inquiries will be sent to his current owner.\n\nWe are looking for a new home for our dog Ziggy. He is 4 years old and has been with us since 8 weeks. He\u2019s a brindles staffordshire mix, 70lbs. He is wonderful with all people, children and toddlers. Knows basic commands, can fetch, is decent on a leash and is healthy. He does not like many other dogs, mostly male dogs. We are searching for a new home for him because he has on several occasion jumped our fence and attacked dogs walking by, bitten and seriously injured them. Although he has shown no aggression towards humans, we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe for him to be here any longer. We have worked with a trainer but he needs to be with someone who is more dedicated to training and keeping him on a watchful eye.

I am smart and responsive, and I know some basic commands. I love to go for car rides. I play well with other dogs but I like to be in charge so my friends should be selected wisely. I can be a bit food protective, so I need to be fed away from activity so I can enjoy my food and treats in peace. I really would do best in a home as the only pet and would prefer no children. I promise to be a loyal companion. \n\nThe staff here loves me and they call me one of their favorites. I can't wait to go to my furever home. Give the Ranch a call and our trainer will give you tons of information about me. You can reach the Ranch 561-972-1194.",

            "description": "Neptune is a sweet 50 lb. 1-year-old Lab-Husky mix with gorgeous blue eyes who is looking for his forever home. He gets along with and loves to play with all dogs but may chase your cat for fun.  If your cat defends itself, Neptune is a big sissy and he'll likely turn and run. \n\nNeptune is good on a leash, and house and crate trained.  He is a medium active boy who would love to be a part of your walking or hiking routine. He would be fine with kids over 12 due to his size.  If you would like to learn more about Neptune, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "Poppy is just the sweetest big lug! This handsome, wiggly boy would love to have a taste of home life. He came to us as a stray and clearly has not had the best care in the past. We've told this good boy that things can only get better from here on out! Poppy walks well on a leash and really seems to enjoy his daily walks. He was introduced to other dogs and seems to have a slightly dominant personality with them. We'd recommend a submissive canine friend in the home if he has any fur siblings. He is a little too interested in cats and will need a kitty free home. Poppy is a big guy and very strong, so recommending a home with children over the age of 10 in his new home. Apply today to meet this big sweetie!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Poppy, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Poppy.\n\nPoppy\nAmerican Bulldog mix\nMale\nDOB: 12/2/2019\nWeight: 70 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

When her rescuers found her she could not have been more grateful and she still loves every single person she meets. She had surgery to close up the wound on her leg and it healed perfectly. Her favorite thing to do is snuggle with her people. We have found that Lena does need to be the only pet in the home but she is great with children. Lena is a tiny little stocky girl, so she does not require a huge house. She loves adventure and riding in the car. If you want to meet this sweetie pie fill out the application today! Her fee is 250$ and she is spayed, UTD on all vaccines and preventatives.",

We do not know for sure as they were a stray prior to being brought into a boarding facility for safe keeping until they can be secured by our rescue. They do well with other dogs and play very well in the play group that they are in at the boarding facility. Both do well with children unknown with cats. These two are super sweet and loving looking for their forever homes. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY. We do not have a facility that the public can come and view our pets at.",

            "description": "THIS SITUATION IS URGENT\n\nMaya previously Landry\n\nLocated in Eastern NE\n1 year old\nAmerican Bulldog/ Mastiff/Labrador/Boxer mix is our best guess\nPreviously ok with some dogs and not with others, currently in a single dog home\nCats unknown, chases but adopter believes it's playful \nGood with kids but can be hyper, nippy and strong so keep that in mind\nHouse trained \nPerfectly crate trained and knows some commands\nStays off furniture \nOnly chews on toys \nFully vetted\nVery strong\nMust have a 6' privacy fence \n65lbs approximately \n\nMaya, previously Landry, is one of Tatums puppies. She originally went to a foster to adopt home but that just didn't work out, not due to her, and she went to a long term foster. That foster home adored her, they had a cat that she tried to play with but the cat wasn't a fan. They ended up having to move to another state however they had a coworker who was interested in adopting. They met Maya and adopted her at the end of the Summer and we heard nothing else. We were contacted at the end of November by the husband stating that they had decided that due to some behavioral issues Maya wasn't a good fit and they needed to \"move on.\" This was obviously shocking and heartbreaking to us. We asked for details as to the behavioral issues and contacted the trainer who they consulted once. \n\nThese are the 3 main concerns:\nShe \"zones in\" on a person and jumps at them sometimes nipping. The older kids and adults are fine but with the younger kids this was an issue.\nShe chases cats\nLeash reactive to other animals \n\nThis girl deserves a FURever home familiar with strong dog breeds. We are willing to pay for a couple secessions with a trainer if adopted/fostered in Eastern NE. \n\nThe adopter is threatening to give her away against our contract and against our approval. Due to this and just because we want her in a home that actually wants her there, we need her moved ASAP. This situation is URGENT.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nLandry was being adopted by her foster family and unfortunately they have now changed their mind.\nThe problem is we have turned down several adoption applications for her believing she was being adopted by her fosters. Now she's available again as she isn't getting along with their chihuahua. She is also a protective dog, as mastiffs are, and needs a mastiff experienced owner. We believe that some of the issues are environmental as this is the 2nd dog that had had the same issues with this family. Her foster family also just had another baby and it's just a lot for Landry. She is a sweet and happy go lucky girl who loves her people and deserves an amazing FURever family! \n\nIf interested please contact us!\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(The $200.00 is considered a nonrefundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we).\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there! \n \n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578",

King has lived with dogs before but we are looking for a family who has no other dogs in their home. \nLook at this face! How can you resist?!\nHe would give anything to be your snuggle buddy on these cold winter nights and your co-pilot on a cruise for a night on the town. \nKing is very good with children, house trained and will play fetch for hours. King needs a fenced in yard and a family who will give him the attention he deserves and a family that accepts him as part of their family.",

Take me to the beach and I will be a happy boy! I love to play with a ball and mud puddles are not too shabby either. Children 10 years and up are my favorites and I may like to have a dog running buddy, but I'd really like to meet them before going home with you so come to the shelter to meet me!!",

He is potty trained, and will scratch the door when he needs to go out. \n\nLudo is a middle aged dog. While we take care of medical needs prior to adoption, it is important to remember that dogs get more expensive to care for as they age. \n\nThis guy is still very young at heart, and will play fetch with you! \n\nIncluded in the adoption fee of $275 is up to date vaccines, dewormer, microchip and neuter. \nApply here for Ludo:\nrebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt",

When he warms up, he will come for pets and play with toys or other dogs - he much prefers dogs to humans at this point. He is crate trained, doggy door trained, and house trained. He does want a quiet place to call his own and loves being able to have the choice to join the family or other dog! He's probably a wire-haired doxie mix and around 2 years and 10lbs. He's looking for a home with another dog and a yard since he takes so long to warm up and is still afraid of people.",

Don't be fooled by his gorgeous appearance, he has \"issues\" and cannot go to a home with children. He is a bite case surrender from Texas. whoever adopts him, will have to sign a form saying they understand this. He needs continuing training to overcome his \"triggers\". He LOVES his daily training sessions with me involving his harness. Possible abuse may have led to some things becoming uncomfortable for him and he responds with the \"fight\" response, in an instant. For Fuego to be successful in his new home, he should have a fenced in yard. One cannot easily put a harness on him; so no walks, same goes for a collar and belly band. I am able to put a muzzle on him, as this is not one of his triggers, but he shouldn't wear it for long periods of time. He is so good at going potty outside, but tends to mark a little indoors, on new items, as there is another boy here that likes to mark. It's a competition apparently. For vet visits and nail trims, we have discovered Gabapentin is a MUST. There is no other way. Works great. On to the good stuff... Fuego LOVES my youngest chihuahua, Sunnie. They play for hours and hours and he is so good with her. He is also really good with my other chihuahuas, but tends be very aggressive if his food/treat is monopolized. I can easily give him treats directly to his mouth. He tends to guard bones that are lying around, though. He loves his kennel, and sleeps in it at night and during the day. Fuego is incredibly loving. He jumps and \"smiles\" when he wants attention and when I come home from work. He will jump up on my lap and demand pets and he loves to be brushed and pet, even his belly! He scoots closer and closer on his butt to get pets. It's so stinking cute. Since I learned his triggers, we have lived happily ever after. It is easy to avoid what makes him tick, he just needs that chance.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster-based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.",

Please go to our website, (socorescue.com) complete an online application and indicate which animal(s) you are interested in. Once approved, you will be contacted to schedule an adoption appointment. Thank you for your patience.\n\nAnnabelle was nursing a litter of pups when she found as a stray within our area. We're not sure if she was abandoned after her litter was born or became pregnant while homeless, only that she was in dire need of being rescued. All of her pups have gone on to find their new homes, but Annabelle had to remain with us while we got her back to good health as she was extremely malnourished and heartworm positive when she arrived.\n\nAnnabelle is very people friendly but tends to be a little reserved when first meeting new people. She will bark at people she isn't familiar with, making her a great option for someone looking for a family companion that will also ward off strangers. Give Annabelle a couple of days to get acquainted with you and she'll be your best friend and more than happy to receive belly rubs and being playful with you. We think that Annabelle will do best in a low commotion type of home and one without young children. Annabelle has preferred being without the company of other dogs and we're not sure if that will change once in a new home.\n\nIn addition to being treated for her heartworms, Annabelle has also been fully vetted and kept on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. A microchip will accompany her adoption. She has displayed signed of having once been housetrained but may require a refresher course once in a home.\n\nTo apply for the adoption of this wonderful girl, please submit an application at socorescue.com",

            "description": "Hi my name is Deano. I'm a 2-3yr old terrier/shih tzu mix and weigh around 15-18lbs.  I was rescued from a shelter in the Houston area by Camo Rescue. My home was \"on the streets\" before Camo Rescue saved me!!! I'm vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. I am currently going through heartworm treatment. As I \"wormed\" (yes that's a thing) into my foster Mom's heart, she has taken very good care of me! I am not sure about the places she takes me, but do love to go in the car. Back seat please! My foster Mom has this weird look on her face because I don't bark! I do like to know where she is most of the time but am very good on a leash (as long as there are no big dogs), I just want to run when I see them. I'm crate and potty trained. My foster mom thinks I will be great in almost any home and with older children. I\"m sure chill so it may take me a bit to warm up in a new environment only due to my yucky past. I hope I have pulled at your heart strings, it would be nice to find my forever home. \n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1.\n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nLuca was adopted as a puppy and returned due to continuing behavioral concerns. He has been incredibly sweet with staff and is still meeting other dogs at the center. Luca needs an adult only, active home who will take him on long walks and outdoor adventures. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center\nLocation: Adoption Center \nThe adoption fee for this dog is waived. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

We think she has Boxer, some Shar-Pei, and possibly some Vizsla. She is around 2 years old and is as sweet as can be. \n\nKiwi will love her person so much and she loves to give kisses on the hand, but is a little shy at first. She can be wary of men and would do better in a home with women or with a couple that is willing to work with her. Once she warms up to you, she\u2019s your best friend, and your lap dog, especially if you give her all the petting she wants. \n\nShe is friendly with other dogs while on walks but is not well socialized and needs to get to know any canine companions. Kiwi has a bit of a prey instinct and would probably not do well with cats. \n\nKiwi is an active dog that loves to go for walks/runs and hikes and loves doing zoomies. She walks well on a leash, enjoys a nice patio, and likes to hang in the backyard with you. Although she is active she will settle in nicely and nap or cuddle.\n\nShe does well with older kids, while she is working on learning not to jump up for attention. Smaller children will probably get knocked down with her energetic behavior. \n\nThis smart girl is house broken and crate trained. She also knows basic commands like, \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, \u201ckennel\u201d, \u201cplace\u201d, and \u201coff\u201d. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a sweet, smart, and loyal companion, Kiwi is your girl.",

She's incredibly happy to be by her human's side, and she shows it with her bouncy feet. She'd be more than happy to lay by your side while you work or watch TV - she's a perfect work-from-home pandemic buddy. She loves her daily walks that are helping with weight loss. Bella's bloodwork showed some issues with her liver health, but we have seen improvement since giving her a daily liver health supplement. Bella is the ideal cozy companion.",

Charlie was living in a back yard with very occasional food and water until he was rescued.\n\nThis rough start has not gotten Charlie down.\nHe is a happy-go-lucky, friendly and sweet guy despite his rough start. He get's along with everyone he meets. \nHe is a playful and silly pup with lot's of personality and fun. He brings laughter to his foster family's home and is an excellent house guest.\n\nCharlie has been living in his foster home and learning how to be a house dog. He is receiving some training  from our AFLAR trainer to help him learn good canine manners. He is crate trained. He is learning good leash manners and would love two walks a day and a back yard to play with his family in.\nCharley would also do well as an only dog so he get's all the love and attention he has been missing.\n\nCharlie's ideal home would be an active home where his family has time to continue his training and give him the love, leadership and stability that he needs to thrive.\nHe would do fine with older children and we don't know about cats.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Charley, please contact.\nInfo@AllForLoveAnimalRescue.org\nfill out an application. www.allforloveanimalrescue.org\n(805) 445-3535\n",

            "description": "Koda is a lovely affectionate puppy that loves to play and run like the wind. He is nearly 9 months old and an energetic boy who seems to be good with dogs after slow introductions and is indifferent to dog savvy cats. He has settled in well, but is nervous about meeting people and other dogs at first. But give him a little time and he will warm up and play. HIs favourite game is running around with a ball in his mouth, can't really call it fetch because he doesn't like to bring it back!. But he is also happy to settle down with his foster brother to chew - either a toy or the foster brother.\nWe are working on manners, he knows how to Come, and Sit and is pretty good about \"No\", also he is also good on a leash with a harness and likes car rides. He is a lightweight Dane ...possible mix because he was found as a pup behind a store. He has no idea how big he is, so he tends to be all over the place, when he isn't being a velcro Dane with a big lean and the back up sit.\nHe is a busy boy, seldom still for long and really beautiful to watch running such a graceful boy.\n\nhttps://greatdanefriends.com/koda\n\nPlease contact Great Dane Friends (info@greatdanefriends.com) for more information about this pet.\n\n*****Great Dane Friends of Ruff Love covers NC and surrounding states for adoptions. We require a fenced yard (exceptions made on a case by case basis - NO exceptions for puppies or deaf/vision impaired dogs - no invisible fencing), that stairs in the home be covered with some sort of slip resistant material to prevent injury, that all other animals in the home be up to date on vaccinations as well as spayed/neutered and that all dogs live inside as a part of the family. Our approval process consists of an application, vet and reference checks, phone interview and house check. Please email us for an application or if you have any questions.*****",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Delta...and I need a job. All the time. My previous family got me, thinking happy and pretty evens out very active and smarter than most people. That is not the case so to the shelter I went. It is true, I am beautiful. I am also going to be huge, powerful and solid. It is also true that I am happy and sweet. I love everyone. Dogs, people, everyone. But I am VERY true to my breed and NEED an outlet for my energy and brains. If you cannot meet those needs, I am not the dog or breed for you. I pick up on things very quickly but need a family that understands my breed and my need to have a job and ensure I understand I am not the boss. I am going to make the right family an AWESOME family member and partner in crime.\n\nI AM NOW READY TO GO HOME!! If you are approved to be my new family, a hold fee of $100 is required and will be applied to the full adoption fee of $350 when MVPC comes to visit your house with me! \n\nADOPTION FEE: $350 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained)\nADOPTER: MUST have WORKING DOG experience. A MALE dog currently in the home for socialization is preferred.\nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 5-6 months\nFENCE: Required (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Yes\nCATS: Yes\nCHILDREN: Yes, over 5 please\n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit.

He is in our boarding facility and working with volunteers as he decompresses from this stressful situation and gets more comfortable.

Her foster mom says she is an absolute doll. She is a happy girl, affectionate with a constantly wagging tail. If you're looking for an addition to your family, Loretta is available for adoption. \n\nLoretta is a gentle 9 year old female lab mix.  She is very well behaved, has a calm disposition and is housebroken. She is happiest when she can sit next to you and get head and belly rubs.  She is a good walker and still has a playful side.  She knows how to sit and comes when called.  She gets along fine with cats but would be best with large dogs or as an only dog (not recommended with very small dogs).  She is being treated for heartworms but the vet said her heart sounds very strong.  She still has a lot of love to give and would make such a loving and loyal addition to any family.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application found on our website bigloverescue.org\nLoretta is in a foster home and a meeting can be set once we have an approved application on file. \n\n",

I am a very sweet boy but I have some anxiety and I am on medication to control it. I am a little unsure of new surroundings a first and I will need some extra time to adjust to my new home. I do get along with some other dogs, I would do fine with older children who aren't too loud, I could get along with cats too but I will need supervision with them at first, I do like to have toys and a blanket of my own to snuggle up with ! It would be to nice to go out for nice long walks with you to take in all of the sights and smells! I am a big boy and a home out in the country where I can really stretch my legs would be just what I'm looking for! I can't wait to meet you to see if I could be the canine companion that you've been looking for! I know that once look into these brown eyes and you won't be able to say \"no\" to me!",

I'm a very smart fellow & I learn quickly! I've lived all my life with 3 other male beagles (also available for adoption) outside as a hunting dog.  But I'm ready to come in & be part of a family! I'm very affectionate & love people! Because I haven't been around young children, I will be placed in a home with older children (8-12 years) or no children. I need a home where I will have a securely fenced yard. I have been known to dig under a fence, so it needs to be secure. I will run off looking for bunnies to chase if I get loose.  I've been learning to walk on a leash since I came to Nittany Beagle Rescue (have a martingale collar & that helps a lot!).  Because I never went anywhere, I'm pretty timid in new situations. Because I've lived all my life outside, I will need work on housetraining & house manners. But I lived in a hutch in my old home, & so I have the idea about going outside vs. inside - so that is a very big start! Nittany Beagle Rescue can provide advice on housetraining & house manners - we actually find it easier to housetrain older dogs than puppies (older dogs focus better!). Jack seems to be good with other dogs. He will chase cats if they run, but we think if someone worked with him on that, he would stop. Jack is a big boy! He barks in a crate, but the more he has exposure to being crated, the better he is doing in them. He does better in metal crates. We need a foster home for Jack so he can start learning about living inside the home with the family. If you aren't ready to adopt, please think about fostering him!",

Dezzy can be a silly girl too, showing that she still has plenty of energy for fun, zooming around the outside runs, but she is most happy to be near someone who wants to give her affection.  Dezzy does like to take a moment or two to check out new people, but she does warm up pretty quickly especially if you have yummy treats and talk to her - she loves to be talked to and told what a good girl she is.\nDezzy is 7 years old and weighs approximately 57 pounds.  She is well mannered; knows how to sit and shake hands when asked (probably lay down too) and is potty trained.\nDezzy may do better in a home where she is the only pet, but she does have a calm, respectful male dog friend she walks with at the shelter. She is such a sweet dog she will be sure to bring her forever home plenty of love and fun. Due to her reserved nature we recommend any children in the home are older teenagers.\n\nIf you would like to meet Dezzy, please fill out a no obligation adoption application at:  https://wishbonepetrescue.org/adopt/adoption-applications/ and an appointment will be set up for you to come in and meet sweetie pie Dezzy",

Christine is still new to AJL, but she is doing great in her foster home with the resident pups and working on potty training. As mentioned before, Christine is still a puppy and with that comes the puppy energy so she may not be the best fit for a home with young children as she does jump up. We are trying to break that habit, but sometimes a puppy will just be a puppy. Christine is currently doing great in an apartment setting, but would love some outdoor space to run around and burn off some energy. After being dumped in Louisiana and being brought to Houston by a caring individual, Christine would love to start 2021 on the right paw in her furever home!\n\n*Christine would do best in a home with another youngish dog with high energy to match hers*",

It is unknown how old I am but I have plenty of spunk and energy so I'm young at heart. I probably would do better with older children if there's any children in the home, because I don't understand how to accomodate for little ones. It's unknown how I am with other animals. I'm eager to get out of here because I'm very stressed out - so please come meet me and maybe we'll be a perfect match! *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

He was possibly used as a hunting dog in his previous life so he does enjoy running around.

I am a 8 month old Cattle Dog mix who was found running. I was such a scared puppy when I was trapped that I didn\u2019t do well with the shelter and the shelter workers. I would get as far back in to my cage as possible and if the shelter works would reach in at me I would growl and snap at them. I was on the euthanasia list. My foster mommy saw my picture on a list and couldn\u2019t let me die so she got me transported to PA. I am doing really good in my foster home. I am learning that people are awesome. I would do better with another friendly dog in the house as they help give me confidence and teach me the ropes. I also need a fenced in yard to keep me safe. I am crate trained and house broken. I like going for walks and car rides. Help me find that forever home.\n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption fee required. If you would like to apply for adoption, please complete the online application at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under ADOPT tab. Please also read our Core Values prior to applying. Contact generalinfo@furryfriendsnetwork.com for questions or if issues are encountered with the adoption application or general adoption process.\n\nFoster Homes are desperately needed in order to help more animals like this one. Please consider opening your heart and home to a homeless animal. To find out more about becoming a Foster Parent, see our website at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under VOLUNTEER tab.\n\nPet ID: Lynn",

ALL OF HER TEETH HAVE BEEN GROUND DOWN TO THE GUMLINE! \nWe don't know what she suffered through but she was fearful of doorways. Louisa was adopted and took training classes at PetSmart, making remarkable progress. Her adopter returned her after 5 months since Louisa remained too nervous around her other pets. \nLouisa has a sweet disposition and we hope she will find a home where someone will be home with her and keep her as their \"only child.\" \n\n*To adopt Louisa, please fill out your application at this link: HTTPS://PETSFURPEOPLE.ORG/PRE-APPLICATION/",

Raleigh came into the shelter as a lost dog on Dec. 1 and his family has not found him. He is just a puppy, about 10 months old, and weighs 54 pounds. He has now been neutered, is up-to-date on vaccinations, tested negative for heart worms and will be micro-chipped upon adoption.  Come meet him in Run 50 using ID# 626274.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Hiiiii! I'm Dutchess, an 8-year-old American Bulldog and I'm a big girl (over 90 lbs!). I used to live on a property with 4 other dogs and a few people, but we were kept outside and didn't have a fence. We would occasionally wander off and cause trouble in the neighborhood, we were basically a dog pack. After a while of not receiving proper care, Dog Control got involved and the court ordered that I be taken to a safe place, which ended up being Stray Haven! The staff has learned a lot about me in the time I've been here and have determined that I need a particular type of adopter. I bond deeply with my people. As I got more and more comfortable with the staff who care for me here, I decided I didn't really want to meet new people when I'd go on meet and greets with potential adopters. I might go and accept a treat from a stranger, but I'd then sit right back next to my staff/family. I have decided the staff is my new family so why would I want to meet new people? I definitely have the ability to bond with new people however. I didn't know the staff when I came in, and look at us now! I can also feel what type of \"\"vibe\"\" a human is giving off and I'm really good at knowing if a person is a good fit for me. I am not shy, on the contrary, I'm a very confident gal and know what I want. Because I'm a bigger girl, the staff wants to make sure I go to a home with people who understand my breed and are confident dog handlers. Although I used to live with dogs, now that I'm older, I don't want to live with dogs anymore, I'm just not a fan. But that's OK, just more of me to love! I'm not sure how I would do with kids either. I did live with kids, but I wasn't in the house until they were teenagers. I would have to meet any youngsters first to see how I like them. Here at Stray Haven I approached some caged cats, and I didn't really seem to care. If you have a cat it's best to give the cat a safe space and not introduce us for a week or two at least. I am definitely a special girl and although I'm not for everyone, I would be great for someone who is a confident dog owner and loves a smart dog. I don't need much exercise at all, and since I'm in my golden years as a bigger breed, I am likely only going to get slower over time. I would love a home with structure/rules, and loving, dog savvy owners where I can be the only dog. If you think you are the one for me, let's talk! Ask the staff for some more information and how to meet with me.\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

Affectionate, snuggly, energetic, happy, loving and extremely smart are all words that have been used to describe this little Princess. Fiona loves to play tug-of-war, chase balls and snuggle up on the couch with her favorite humans. Shes potty trained, and good in a crate when required. Fiona picks up tricks and commands very quickly as shes super food motivated. Fiona is only a couple of years old so shes still got a bit of puppy energy, but if youre up for a daily walk and hikes (her favorite!) shes content to lay at your feet (or on your lap) and snore the day away. Fiona loves her people so much that shes insisted she be the only dog/animal in your home and when you have the perfect dog, who needs any more?

Great with other dogs too but does sometimes try to \"hump\" them. We don't think he will do well with cats but he's never been properly tested. He prefers to be with his human as much as possible but also does ok in a crate for a reasonable amount of time. \n\nBack story: He was pulled from a local shelter's euthanasia list after being picked up as a stray. He had a limp but we assumed it was nothing major since he was still using his leg. We later found out he needed a total hip replacement. They thought he may have been hit by a car at some point. Well, he got the surgery and it was a long road to recovery but he is 100% now and ready to find his perfect forever.",

Ramona, is the star of the couch potato series, and she is looking for her co-star, in what critics are calling a box office special. Ramona has an idea of what her set and crew members look like, and has provided a list: *A low-traffic home, either an apartment or a house with a yard, as long as there is room on the couch for her queen-sized frame. *A family, with mostly adults because she likes her crew to understand that she likes adults who respect her space. *Humans who will kindly give and receive an endless amount of hugs and kisses, with her record-winning large tongue. She has so much love to share, and is the sweetest dog with her people. *Someone to snap videos and pictures of her - her lack of thumbs makes it hard to maintain the social media presence necessary for a successful Hollywood career! She is very photogenic and even sports costumes if you can find her size! *Someone to appreciate and fawn over the tippy-toe dances she gives you whenever you come home, because she's so excited to see you! Ramona knows what she wants, and if you're willing to provide that for her, she will multiply the love and affection in return, at no cost. She is house trained and can watch the place when you need to run for popcorn or hot dog treats! Come meet this Hollywood Starlet today! Follow Ramona on Instagram @everybody.loves.ramona",

He likes all kinds of toys, especially stuffed ones. He likes all kinds of treats, and he is a quick learner for a food reward. He has a short, single coat, so he doesn't require any daily de-tangle or fancy professional grooming. No fuss, he only wants a place to curl up with his forever person.

I\u2019m a 4 year old Australian cattle dog mix about 40 pounds.  I\u2019m a bit of a clown and don\u2019t take life too seriously.  I love belly rubs, snacks, cuddles, kisses and bum scratches.  I\u2019m also pretty active and would love to go on a hike or walk with you and get to know your favorite places.  I\u2019m great with other dogs and love running and playing with all my pup friends.  My foster mama says I\u2019m really smart, know my manners and I\u2019m great walking on my leash.  I\u2019m all chipped and ready to go - are you ready for a new adventure?\n\n*All of The Right to Live dogs are fostered locally in San Antonio Texas and will be transported to other states to their new families upon adoption. We believe fostering dogs and not having them decompress in a kenneled environment is more beneficial for the dogs and builds their trust and companionship in a family situation. Adoption fee includes transportation costs, previous/current medical treatment (spay/neuter, etc.) and a health certificate for cross-state travel*\n",

            "description": "MEET LAYLA 6!!\n\nFrom Layla's foster: Layla came to our home undernourished and hand shy. She initially got along with our other dogs but as she gained strength she became aggressive toward our female and the two engage in fights every time they are together. ,Layla is crate trained and we do have a crate for her to take with to her forever home. ,She knows, sit, stay, and wait (for food). Because she was underfed she was very food aggressive, but we have worked with her and she is much improved. She also far less hand shy and is no longer fearful of quick body movements. We have a cat that she wants to play with but he is not good with dogs at all so we do not know how she would do with a playful cat. Layla has not been dog park tested. Layla is very good on car rides and good on walks. She does become excited around other animals and will chase but stops when verbally corrected. Layla is pretty shy when meeting new people but warms up to them with encouragement. She loves belly rubs and snuggles. Layla is on all natural dog food and some foods upset her digestion. (This is why she is listed as special needs). Layla's ideal forever home would be one where she is the only pet and can go everywhere with her human.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "Wesley is a shy kinda fella - he likes people, but it takes him a bit to get over his shyness. He was abandoned by his owner and this shook his confidence. Wesley is not a cuddle bug kinda guy, he is more of a quiet guy who is happy to keep you company but without all the touchy feely stuff. Just like people, some enjoy being the life of the party, others prefer calmness and quiet. That is our Wesley. For that reason, we recommend an adult only home for this guy.\n\nDon't let Wesley's XL size fool you. Wesley still scares easily - loud noises, strangers coming up quickly behind him..he will startle and needs reassurance. Wesley loves to get out and enjoy walks in the park and getting exercise. He just needs love, reassurance and patience as he works on his confidence.\n\nHe is currently enrolled in training and is doing great. He is totally unfazed by the other dogs in his class and happily follows the commands his handler gives him.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

Molly will need to be on prescription food during her lifetime to prevent uti and crystals.

My ideal home would be a quiet one with a privacy fence! I am working hard on house training but have mastered crate training! I am great with kids too! I am headed to the Pups for Parole program where I will learn all kinds of cool tricks! I will be back around March 17th ready to move into my forever home! To the world you may be one person but I promise to always make you my world!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

The nice people here took me in and got me settled. That was 2 months ago, and now shelter life is starting to get to me and I'm not doing so well. I'm anxious and worried and acting up a bit. \nI am a super-smart girl who loves mental and physical activities. In fact, the shelter trainer named me \"The Quickest Learner Ever\". I am good on a leash, non-reactive to other animals on walks, and have the cutest little prance. I am working on my social skills with other dogs. But for now, I need a home with no other pets. If you are looking for a pint-sized sweetheart, please complete the adoption form at hsnb.org/adoptions. My fee is $300. Thank you!

He can't wait to love his new family. \n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

They love people almost as much as I do. They have no other pets so I get to be the center of their world. Their home has older children or adults and a great neighborhood for walks. If you find them or see them, tell them I\u2019m looking for them. I\u2019m 8 years old, around 60lbs and I love all the toys. I\u2019m potty trained and crate trained like a good girl. I love everyone but I feel most comfortable eating meals alone. I traveled all the way from South Carolina to find you. I was covered in scars and scabs and my face was swollen. I was infested with fleas and ticks when I left the scary shelter. Before I ended up there I was a stray searching the streets for someone to love me. \n\nPlease help me find my hooman. All I want to do is snuggle all day every day with them. I love to be loved and the best kind of love is a forever love. \n\nADOPT-\nwww.OperationFreedomRide.com/dog",

            "description": "Meet Henry~\n\nMy name is Henry and I am a 1 year old Boston Terrier/ Chi mix from South Carolina.  I weigh roughly 23 lbs.\n\nHenry is a cute little guy for sure! He does have some of the little dog mentality though we have recently found out. He will need a home where he will not be allowed to run the show. Henry needs a confident handler who will teach him what behaviors are acceptable and not acceptable. This guy can definitely be a brat sometimes!\nWith proper training and guidance, this little guy will make a fantastic little bud!\n\n With my adorable looks, and unbridled loyalty, I will always be there for you through thick and thin. I will never judge you, or turn my back on you. Every single day, you will look at me and you will know that you are loved unconditionally. I will never betray you or hurt you, and I will grow old by your side.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

She has been socialized with dogs of all sizes and has done well but tends to be bit shy/timid of new humans. Charmaine would be fine children over 12 years but a home with young children is not ideal. Previous shy dog experience preferred.\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\n\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed. An application, home check, contract and adoption fee are required for all adoptions. All dogs will be, or required to be, spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped before adoption. Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\n\nAdoption fees vary between $350 - $450 for puppies 8 weeks - 8 years, $300 for dogs 8 years and over. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip a wellness check, any additional medical expenses necessary and of course the all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\n\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\n\nFor additional information or questions, please email us at info@muttmatchla.org.

He is a tripod and still adjusting to getting around on three legs. He is insecure after being TERRIBLY abused. \n\nTrip loves people but is shy at times. He LOVES other dogs and will play for hours if allowed. He thinks cats are just begging to be chased and other little critters (like squirrels) are coming for his toys. \n\nTrip needs a patient, loving family to help him become his best self. He is currently being treated for heartworm (non-contagious and curable) at the expense of the rescue and is expected to make a full recovery.  Do you have room in your heart and home for his amazing dog? Do you have the patience and interest in helping to restore his trust in human-kind? \n\n If you'd like to learn more, fill out an application at www.pacificanimalsociety.org",

When he goes for a walk, he pulls on the leash at first because he's so happy to get out of his kennel but he does calm down and becomes much easier to walk. He does like to play with toys, he knows \"sit\" for treats and takes them very gently.\n\nThere's a couple of things that Tank doesn't like and that's his kennel at the shelter and crates. He doesn't like to be confined and needs a home where he has free roam of the house. A backyard where he can run around and explore and play with toys. Tank also needs to be the only dog in the home. He does not do well around any other dogs and cannot go to a dog park.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Tank, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

We are seeking a quiet home for her because she is easily frightened. She will need a little time to adjust in any home she goes to. If you are patient and just looking for company please think about giving Lala the retirement home of her dreams.\n\nPlease fill out an application at www.njshpetrescue.org\n\nYou must live within 60 minutes of Chester NJ to be considered",

Poor little Gabby has not been provided the love, attention, safety and environment needed to relax as a dog. She would bark at a dust bunny if it made noises. Once she realizes no threats are around, she melts into being a love bug. She seems to believe other dogs and the outside world is so scary that nothing can be trusted until she is absolutely certain to be safe. Gabby is going to need slow, deliberately patient, consistent introduction in measured slow increments to release her fear of the unknown, and feel the gentle, loving bond of safety. Inside the home she is a gem. Gabby needs a no dog home, with a person who understands her need to take everything that involves the outside world slowly, not cheating her out of experiences yet providing them in a way she can handle.\n\nDo you have the love, time and patience to give Gabby the stability and time to give you back everything she has tucked in her big heart?\n\nApply today for Gabby at:\n\nhttps://www.nwboxerrescue.org/adoption-form\n\nIf you would like to adopt her, fill out an adoption application on our website www.nwboxerrescue.org\n\nLike us on facebook for more photos of this pretty girl, as well as other boxers we have available! www.facebook.com/northwestboxerrescue",

I let my foster mom give me a bath. Unfortunately I have been told I had gum issues and had a bunch of teeth pulled about 2 years ago. My fosters noticed I don't like my teeth brushed. I have been eating dry food fine for my foster mom and love it twice a day. My foster moms granddaughter is 11 years old and when she visits I let her brush me and I lay on her lap and we cuddle.  I'm already house trained and get alone with other dogs. Unsure of cats since my fosters don't have any in their home. I was surrendered because of a new living situation that didn't allow dogs but seem to be adjusting to my new surroundings pretty well. It did take me a day or two to get use to walking on hardwood floors. I've been enjoying a fenced in yard and running and playing with tennis balls. I also don't jump up at people. I like people and would like a more active home. My fosters say I have been a joy to have around. Please come give me a chance.",

He tested positive for lyme and is currently on antibiotics to treat it.\nRusty is a sweet boy and loves attention from his humans. He enjoys the company of both kids and adults. He is content to just hang out and chill with them.\nRusty is still learning his manners and basic commands as well as how to walk on a leash and will need someone who is willing to take the time to help teach him those things. \nHe is crate trained and house broken. A fence for this guy is a MUST. He loves to wander around outside and explore.\nRusty would do well in a home where he is the only dog or with a very passive female dog. Cats are unknown so a cat free home would be best.\nRusty is available for foster to adopt right now as his neuter appointment is not scheduled until January. Once he has been neutered then the adoption process can be finalized.",

We really aren't sure what mix of breeds she is but one thing we know for sure is she is very cute, sweet and would make someone a wonderful companion. She is on the smaller side of medium at only about 35lbs.   She does take quite a bit of time to warm up and trust but once she does watch out as she loves to cuddle.   Scarlett loves other dogs, small and large, and would do better in a home with a dog who has strong canine leadership skills whose lead she can follow as well as more mellow dogs.  She also is just fine with cats.    She would prefer a home with older children (or no children) as quick movements can startle her.

He likes fuss and snuggles and a tug toy, but is also a fan of snoozing away.

She will be treated with eye drops and may need surgery to correct it. She gets along with people and other dogs. UPDATE: Mabel gave birth to 9 puppies on 12/11/20. Once the pups have been weaned she will be spayed and she will be ready for a home of her own.Accuracy is not guaranteed; however, information provided is accurate to the best of our knowledge.\n\nFor more information on the pet, please send an email to info@aforeverhome.org",

            "description": "Say hello to Thunder! He is a 2 year old Shepherd mix who weighs 71.7 pounds. Thunder is a big goofball. He is a happy and friendly guy who has lots of energy to burn. \n\nThunder needs an adopter who will be committed to training him. Based on what we\u2019ve learned about this guy so far, he would do best with an experienced dog owner. Specifically, someone who has experience training large breed dogs with big personalities. Thunder can be very puppy-like and has not yet learned that jumping, nipping, and being mouthy are unacceptable ways to play with friends. When he gets mouthy, it escalates with excitement - he isn't trying to be aggressive, but this is a behavior that needs to be corrected asap for his safety and the safety of others. We believe that with proper training, these behaviors will be corrected - he just didn't get that training in his life prior to coming to WIsh Bone. Because of his size, energy, and tendency to be mouthy, Thunder will need to go to a family with no kids under the age of 16.\n\nIf you'd like to make Thunder a part of your family, please fill out an application to meet him! His minimum adoption fee is $295 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

She is a little shy when she first encounters people and needs to voice her concerns, but she warms up quickly and then, watch out! She's all sorts of playful! She is also a world-class snuggler, kisser, and incredible athlete. This little dynamo can turn on a dime in mid-air to snatch a tennis ball.\n\nKona has a strong play drive and prey drive. BALL IS LIFE and she also likes to tug. She gets great joy out of wearing her people out! She also is a squirrel chaser, and due to her strong prey drive, we will recommend a home without cats. She gets along with other dogs her own size with proper and gradual introductions, but she likes to be in charge. She has not been tested with unfamiliar small or larger dogs at this time. In her last home, she liked to be the \"boss babe,\" with her dog brother, which sometimes led to nipping and a human needing to step in to break it up. Kona could benefit from learning about appropriate boundries. She has been receptive to children (14 years old and over are a potential), but she is still in the evaluation process at her foster home, and we will post more information as we have the chance to observe her further. Kona is very treat driven and loves her kibble, peanut butter, peaches, apples, and ice cubes! She aims to please and loves her rewards! Kona is skittish with new people, but she is able to take cues from her handler with new experiences. She did well on a trip to Lowe's, and is not spooked by speeding roadbikes, mountain bikes, hikers, or clanging metal. She was appropriately apprehensive when she met a bear, but she did not panic or lunge. \n\nKona has not had much training in her past. She's learned \"house rules,\" and has been taught some basic commands (sit, stay, down, come, drop-it), but little else. In foster, we are working on crate training, touch, and manners. She is VERY smart and eager to please. She will need leash training and obedience training, and she'll need a home that is willing to work with her consistently. Kona is mostly potty trained, but will need her training reinforced. She's been known to potty in the house and tear things up when left alone. She is not a fan of her crate and has been known to break out of a wire crate when left alone. Kona will certainly need some time and understanding as she works through her separation anxiety. This girl won't be able to be left alone for long periods of time. A home with adults at home throughout the day will be the best fit for Kona. \n\nShe sure does love her people though and craves belly rubs, cuddles, praise, and attention! Kona will make a great companion for a home that has the time and knowledge to train and encourage her to be the best dog she can be! She is incredibly loving, and will bloom with a family that can give her soft voice and consistent boundaries. Kona has many talents that the right home could develop, and with work, she could excel at agility, flyball, or disc.\n\nIf you have questions about Kona, please reach out to her adoption counselor Tarah Winslette Tarah@madrescueinc.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Kona, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organization that does not have a physical location.

Ruger loves meeting new friends! He LOVES to go for walks and to run and play with dogs in his foster home. Ruger is medium energy and  is always happy! He is good with other dogs and ignore cats, fully vetted and he is heartworm negative. \n\nHe loves toys and soft blankies.  He came into rescue a bit on the thin side but he is starting to fill out with good grub and tasty treats. He crates easily for a cookie and helps remind his foster mom at mealtimes.\n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption? Fill out our adoption application (http://www.pointerrescue.org/adopt.html)!!\n\nTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES! (currently within 600 miles)\n",

A really nice boy named Miles, who is just a little bit shy when he meets you - but will look you in the eyes as if to say \"Are you my person?\" Miles is an 6-8 year old male terrier mix. He is light tan and white, and has the softest fur! The vet says he has a grade II or III heart murmur (on a scale of one to six)\n. He is fully grown, weighing in at 24 lbs, and could afford to gain another pound or two. We're still learning about this snuggly boy, so be sure to check http://www.campcocker.com/miles soon for updates, and maybe some videos!\n\nMiles was rescued in a joint effort from South Korea, and has now arrived in Los Angeles to start his new and happy life. He is healthy and up-to-date on all vaccines.\n\nApply to adopt Miles here: http://www.campcocker.com/adoptionprocess",

            "description": "Meet Draper!\n\nDraper was found as a stray and taken to Riverside Shelter on December 3rd. He is 8 years old and weighs 82 lbs. At his veterinary exam, we learned Draper is a healthy senior gentleman with arthritis in his front elbows. He doesn't let it stop him from playing fetch - be sure to watch the adorable video!\n\nThis handsome guy went on a two week Frosted Fling for the holidays and earned himself a Foster home until he's adopted! Here's what we've learned:\n\nDraper eats kibble like a champ and takes his meds nicely in his breakfast. He longs for you to share what you're eating, but he's very polite and would never impose on you during your meal. Draper is a mellow boy but still enjoys a stroll around the neighborhood. He can walk about 2-3 miles per day in increments and really likes to take in all the smells. Draper is very good with other dogs and kids, but doesn't really know his size and his excitement to say hello can be overwhelming for some. No worries, he calms down to his normal mellow self soon and then gets along with most everyone!\n\nDraper is potty trained, but he only likes to do #2 on walks, not in the yard. Don't worry, he will whimper and let you know it's time to go out!\n\nHis Foster Mom shares, \"Draper has many lovable qualities:\n\n*\n\nSuch a gentleman... always stands up when the lady of the house stands up\n\n*Plays with toys, ropes, and will fetch a ball (you may or may not get it back!)\n\n*Always has his tail wagging when he thinks your going to give him attention.\n\n*Will allow you to sleep 8 hours (no matter what time you go in to sleep)\n\n*Loves belly rubs, ear rubs, all body massage, and cuddles\n\n*Can walk 2-3 miles per day in increments\n\n*Great companion in the car\n\n*Plays well with other dogs\n\n*Great watch /guard dog if he \"sees\" stranger danger (not sure if he can hear well.)\n\n*Can be trusted to be left alone at home.\"\n\nDraper is ready for family! Apply at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 2/1/21 KG",

Unfortunately his previous owners did not train him so he is learning basic manners with his amazing foster family. The have reported that Durk is highly intelligent and learning very quickly. He loves to curl up in bed with you and cuddle :) We recommend children over 12 years old because he is still learning his manners. \n\nDurk is social, curious and very affectionate. He is still very much a puppy and has lots of energy! Like with every dog we recommend following a two week shutdown to help ensure success in your adoption. \n\nDURK has been vet checked, is UTD on shots, dewormed with Drontal, on Heartgard and Flea/Tick Prevention. He is also microchipped. \n\nIf interested in applying to adopt with us please fill out an application and one of our application processors will contact you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience.\nhttps://goo.gl/AzrASu\n\nThank you for saving a life by choosing to adopt :)",

I am up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped. I am heartworm positive, but I am undergoing treatment and the rescue pays for treatment until I am heartworm negative! I am house trained, crate trained, and love to run and play outside. I'm currently working on walking on a leash as I tend to pull, but only because I'm so excited to walk. I love belly rubs and will curl up on the couch to watch Netflix, and my foster mom puts on puppy dog pals for me. I love toys, preferably not squeaky ones because I'm not to sure about the sound, but I love chasing a ball. I hardly ever bark but I will let you know when the UPS man is at the door!! I have not been tested with children although I would probably do well with children who are polite and sweet with me. I tend to be picky with my dog friends so I will need to be the one and only, but that's OK because I'm all the dog you'll ever need!\n\nIf you are interested in giving Anastasia a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal. We review them on a first come first served basis. If your application is approved, we will contact you and allow you the opportunity to adopt. If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us and we will be glad to help!",

She can read her audience when it comes to dogs or humans and plays off their energy level meaning if she is surrounded by bustle she can get rowdy, and if surrounded by a calmer home will mirror the calmer energy.\n\nBarbara is constantly rehearsing her leash manners for the main event of a walk and will need to continue to work on this in her forever home. At first, her over-exuberance can intimidate other dogs, but with slow introductions she does well. She loves time with other dogs, where she can say Hello Dolly (or Donny) to canine companions. We may know the story of The Owl and The Pussycat, but the story of Barbara and the feline friend is not a good counterpart, so she should not go to a home with cats. Barbara has not yet been around children, but due to her mirroring the energy of those around her, it would be best for her to go to a calmer home with middle school age children or above.\n\nBarbara was born a star, and after a rough start has decided no more tears and that she is ready to meet the family of her dreams. You don't have to bring this girl flowers, but bones to win her affection. Apply to meet Barbara at https://rescuecrew.org/adopt-animal-in-need/#adoptionapplication\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

            "description": "This is Rooney!\n\n8-year-old Rooney was brought into the Riverside Shelter as over-the-counter stray. He weighs 6 lbs. A visit to our vet revealed that he has some kidney issues, but luckily. his heart sounds and looks great, so we can treat him! Rooney has dental surgery scheduled in February.\n\nOn January 16th, Rooney landed himself a wonderful Foster home. His Foster Mom asked who has been overlooked and who really needed her. Rooney looked up with his one eye and asked if he could be the lucky one she chose, and he was! Rooney desperately wants to be loved! He will walk up to volunteers in the yard and wait to be noticed. He doesn't enjoy being picked up (that's where blankets come in handy!), but if you sit near him, he will climb into your lap and nudge you for pets. We look forward to hearing how Rooney blossoms in his Foster home.\n\nWe received a great first update from Rooney's Foster Mom! She shared, \"Checking in after Rooney's first week in foster. Rooney is a HUGE cuddle bug. Anywhere you are sitting he will come and sit next to you, on top of you, one paw touching, or head on your lap, he will come as close as you allow. He doesn't know what personal space means. If I let him, he would sleep on my face! He would love nothing more than to have someone pet him ALL day. I was warned that he wasn't a fan of being picked up, but we haven't had that problem at all! He seems a little unsure but has never reacted to being picked up. The only time he has reacted is when he is being groomed. He doesn't like grooming and will let you know. He can be melodramatic about it. But despite the occasional snarkiness when being groomed (and to be fair, few dogs enjoy grooming), Rooney is the sweetest boy. He doesn't hold grudges. 30 seconds after snarking at me for grooming him, he is back on my lap rolling around and pawing at me for pets. I call him my little sour patch kid. First he's sour, then he's sweet. Very very sweet!\"\n\nCheck back soon for the next update on Rooney! If you think this cuddle bug might be the one for you, apply to meet him: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

He is just a gorgeous boy and is as charming as he is good looking.\nNoble is a young boy and it is pretty clear that he did not get much training in his previous home. He is very active and pretty wild right now, but we have no doubt he'll settle in to a very nice well behaved boy after getting some clear, concise and consistent training. We are looking for a Siberian savvy home for him and he is really not a great starter husky just yet. No young kids at this point until he gets some calmer manners. We want someone with experience who can be a confident leader and who is active and can take him out for jogs or perhaps bike riding. He would require a 6' fence as he can leap pretty high. He is very athletic!\nNoble likes other dogs but can play rough so he is not a good choice for littler dogs or seniors. An active female would be his ideal playmate. He is such a diamond in the rough and spending a bit of time training him will result in a wonderful companion.",

Quiet neighborhood works. She should be the only pet.\n\n********************************************\n\nJoey: What if you saw a three-legged puppy?\nChandler: I'd be sad, sure - but I wouldn't cry.\nJoey: OK; well, what if the puppy said, \"Help me, Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me\"?\nChandler: Cry? I just found a talking puppy! I'm rich!\n\nWe received the most informative email about a dog who needed us, from the dog herself. Although we know the dog didn\u2019t type it-man that coulda made LEAD get rich fo real-we said yes to helping before finishing the email. \n\nIt stated she was found shivering and a nice human took her in. This human-who btw seems to know the secrets of rescue pretty well-posted all over with flyers, contacting local vets, checking for a chip, etc to get this beaut back home. But nothing came about, so this dog had to figure out another plan. She visited the park\u2019s local pee messages left on fire hydrants and unlucky bushes about what to do and butt sniffed out the 5 star \u201cYelp\u201d reviews about LEAD. This is a smart coming of age dog, I\u2019m telling ya.\n\nAnd now I will be a dog to describe Sparrow because how fun.\n\nMy name is Sparrow and I am a 7-8 year old, 70-80 lb Doberman Hound mix. I honestly have no idea where my original family went but I guess I have to move on to finding someone completely new. Someone who will love me unconditionally and grow attached to my old soul. I settle pretty quickly in a new environment especially if you enjoy toys as much as me. I love to carry mine around in my mouth, but doubt you do since you have hands. I don\u2019t mess with anything in the home and that includes no potty messes either. A lady never poops where she eats! I do fine with other dogs as long as we get a proper intro so don\u2019t just put your big booty in my face. I currently live with a small dog and she wants to play but I rather sleep the day away. I\u2019m mildly playful but still nap city sounds so much better than play city. However, I love going on quarantine walks any time of the day since there\u2019s literally nothing else to do. I like to be the \u201cLEADer\u201d hehe, so my foster human got me a head halter to help with my \u201cleading\u201d the way. I know a lot of basic commands being so treat motivated, so therefore someone did take the time with me at some point. However, you\u2019ll need to keep teaching me to use my soft jowls instead of my strong teeth to take these delicious treats. I\u2019m just too excited for food! I\u2019m not at all a huge barker but if I hear a disturbing noise at home. I might have to chime in. But to be honest, you\u2019ll probably enjoy me scaring away robbers and creeps. Although I think just seeing me, they wouldn\u2019t dare try. Maybe have them feed me a treat with my hard mouth lol. And lastly, no cats or kids for me, please. I\u2019m a senior who just wants to sunker down without having to be bothered by grubby little paws or bothered by your two year old\u2019s tantrums.\n\nIf you are interested in our non talking dog but like a normal dog, please apply for Sparrow at leadrescue.org!",

She gets lube in both eyes 3-4 times a day and Optimune 1 time a day in both eyes.\n- Because of her poor vision, Mitzi has poor depth perception and cannot go down stairs (she can go up them). A home with no stairs, or with a family who is willing to always carry her down any stairs is required.\n \nFavorite Toys \u2013 doesn\u2019t play with any dog toys \u2013 but loves towels & clothes. If she has a towel to play with or to steal from you she is a happy girl. \nShe\u2019s not playful with me or my dogs. She\u2019s playful with towels, clothes, paper, leaves, grass, and everything she finds that a dog shouldn\u2019t have. \n\nFavorite Activity - Snoozing on the bed or playing with a towel or clothes. She wants to be where everyone is and cries to let us know she wants to be included.\n\nFavorite treat \u2013 Keifer Milk (frozen into bone shape); almost climbs in the freezer for one!\n\nHi! My name is Mitzi and I\u2019m a 7 year old apricot pug. I\u2019ve been learning how to become a family pet and I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun! I\u2019m learning that love from a human is amazing! I absolutely love getting belly rubs and I demand them often.\n\nMy mom says I\u2019m \u201cskittish\u201d because I\u2019m still unsure of sudden movements so I tend to freeze in place out of fear. However, I love sleeping in bed with my foster mom, foster fur brother, and foster fur sister. I also love my foster mom\u2019s towels and clothes. I\u2019m ornery so I like to steal them, take off running with them so my foster mom has to chase me.\n \nI\u2019m looking for a forever home that is patient with me. I\u2019m working on weight loss so that will be important to continue. My eyes are dry and need medicine a couple of times a day. I do have allergies so I need medicine when they are bad. I also need a home that has a fenced in yard with another dog who I can follow around & learn from. I haven\u2019t been around cats or kids but since I\u2019m still unsure of sudden movements I\u2019d probably do best with older children or dog savvy children.\n \nI\u2019m a fun, ornery and sassy pug looking for a house that is patient and likes to have fun.\n \nMitzi\u2019s minimum adoption donation is $275.\n\nInterested in adopting? Email our adoption coordinator kristi@pugpartners.com and let her know why you think your home is a perfect match for Mitzi!",

For weeks he just sat around sad and wouldn't even walk much. \n\nAfter a few weeks of that he started feeling better and moving more confident . We found that Casper loves on thing more than anything else, and that is fetching a toy, any toy, His trick is though you half to have two toys to get him to drop the one he has in his mouth, but his new speed with three legs is amazing ! you can play for hours and he still wants to play, so a active home that will have the time to play with him.\n\nCasper is also a good cuddle buddy, is kennel trained, housebroken, and does well on a leash. Casper is ready for his forever family .",

He is also a fence climber so he is a dog that can't be left unattended or loose at a dog park/park. Copper also knows basic commands and is housebroken.

            "description": "Hi I am Jenni, an 8 year old 65 pound pit mix. I have had a rough start to life and am learning what life is like inside a home and I absolutely love it!   My favorite thing to do is run and play with balls. I have not quite learned the concept of bringing the ball back though, and I love to find some great hiding spots throughout the yard.  Cow ears are my favorite treat but I am not a picky eater so I will try just about anything.  I forgot to mention that I just LOVE toys but they do not stand a chance around me! I know some basic commands and I am learning leash manners.  I am also house and crate trained and get along great with all of my humans. I am dog selective so I would like to meet other dogs before coming home if I am not the only dog. I have a high prey drive, so cats and I do not get along very well. After running and playing, I love snuggling up in a nice blanket and getting some love and rubs!  I am now looking for my forever family, one that will love me and give me the home I know I deserve! \n\nAre you interested in adopting Jenni or another JCAPL pet you have seen? You'll need to start by completing an adoption application, available online at our website: www.jcapl.org. There is no obligation to adopt by completing an application, however, we do recommend submitting an application as soon as you find an animal you are interested in. We review applications in the order they are received.\n\nCompleted applications can be sent via email to adopt@jcapl.org , faxed to 919-300-5524 or delivered in person by visiting us at one of our adoption events on Saturdays at PetSmart in Garner (White Oak Shopping Center). \n\nWe will contact you as soon as possible once we receive your application.\n\nThanks for thinking adoption!",

She had emergency surgery at WSU vet school to repair her elbow, then needed a second surgery two months later to remove the plates once the fracture had healed. Additionally, she also had a mast cell tumor on her head that was removed when she was spayed.\nPopcorn was born in July 2020, so she is now a little over 6 months old, is a bulldog, and she weighs about 40 pounds. \n\nThis sweet and sassy nugget is feisty, silly, snuggly, and a very social girl with a BIG personality!  She loves going out in public and meeting all the people to get all the love!\nPopcorn has been well socialized and loves everyone, canine and human.  She thinks going to the vet is a social event!  Everyone she greets gets a wiggle and a snort.  Such a funny girl!\n\nPopcorn is working on potty training and her adopter will need to continue working on that, and general puppy training, with her.  She\u2019s learned to tell her foster mom when she needs to go outside, and she is very treat motivated. She is crate trained, but when she wants out of her crate she will let you know, and let you know LOUDLY. Popcorn lives with canine foster brothers and cats.  She loves them all but will chase the cats if allowed so, while she can live with kitties, it needs to be kitties who are dog savvy and will ignore a silly pup.  She definitely has a more dominant and bossy personality with other dogs, and she\u2019s a very physical, robust player. If there's another dog in the home, it should be a male.\nShe has been around kids and while she\u2019s done great with them, we don\u2019t recommend she live in a home with small children (12 or over) because she can be mouthy, especially if touched in a way she doesn\u2019t like (her elbow required physical therapy and she made her opinions clear about not liking that!). \n\nPopcorn loves all toys and loves to play.  When playing by herself she somersaults -- tosses the toy and then starts rolling around.  And has an extraordinary snore when sleeping!  Life is grand and Popcorn goes full on in everything she loves -- playing, snuggling, snoring -- you get the idea!  And when she isn\u2019t happy about something she has quite a scream.  Yes, scream. Her foster mom has nicknamed her the \u201cmandrake root\u201d (Harry Potter reference!) because she makes her opinions very known. \n\nWhile Popcorn\u2019s elbow has healed as well as could be expected given the fracture, she will always have a slight limp and arthritis will definitely develop in that elbow. She\u2019ll need to be kept on life-long joint supplements, an NSAID (eg carprofen), and kept at a lean weight. Since she needs to be on NSAIDs long term, she should have, at minimum, yearly bloodwork. Continued physical therapy and acupuncture would also benefit her elbow. \nAn adopter will also need to prepared for the possibility of Popcorn developing additional mast cell tumors, as it isn\u2019t typically common for a pup so young to have had one. The one she had was removed with clean margins and was low-grade, and she hasn\u2019t developed any more, but an adopter will need to keep an eye on her for any possible growths.\n\nWe would prefer an adopter who is familiar with or has had experience with English bulldogs.\n\nIf you think Popcorn would be a good addition to your home please complete an application, which can be downloaded from our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com. Her adoption fee is $450, and she has been spayed, is up to date with vaccinations, and microchipped.",

After about three months she has now finally started walking and running on all fours. She is the sweetest girl,\nZoey can be shy and timid at first when meeting new people, but warms up quickly and becomes your best friend.\n\nZoey is by all means our loudest guard dog we have, she alerts everyone when something new is around of when the goats and cows are near by. She is fully kennel trained , house broken , and walks well on a leash. Zoey is ready for her new family to call her own.  \n",

She loves to bunch and hold them. \nShe is spayed and UTD on shots.  She has been with a foster and is completely housetrained now. Lil sash needs a new home because there was another dog in household that makes it her mission to make Lil Sash\u2019s life miserable by chasing her down and beating her up. . Sash loves people although she\u2019s timid upon first meeting. Seems to be ok with most dogs, a slight more dominant dog might fit best.  If you\u2019d like to meet lil sash please call Sandie @1-307-450-8814. She is located near Dubois Wy",

Our little legged lady is just a year old. She's not destructive.  She knows where pee goes and this girl ADORES children. Other moderately active dogs are GREAT, but cats are probably a no go.

He has the cutest underbite that just completes his adorable face! Nelson is good with other dogs if introduced properly and actually would benefit from living with another dog who is well mannered. He suffers from high anxiety and can get over stimulated quickly, so he would benefit from a ton of exercise and continued training. He shouldn't be homed or around children due to his over stimulation.\n\nIf you'd like to meet NELSON BAILEY, please complete an adoption application, which can be found in the adoptable dogs section of our website www.ehrdogs.org!",

The breed choices on this pup are best guess. She definitely has the spots of a German Pointer and those ears that flip up and down, give her a Dane look. She is very observant.We are just getting to know her, so we will update as we learn more. She sits and lays down, so she has some manners. She likes Milk Bone treats.

He loves to play and does well with other dogs, although like most puppies he still needs to be corrected and continue to learn how to have good play manners. Choco plays hard and naps hard afterwards. He will need an active home who is ready for the puppy energy. He will also need continued training and structure to thrive. He is very intelligent which will be a huge asset for further training but like most working dogs he will need continued enrichment to stay stimulated and out of trouble! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Choco fill out an application today! \nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "This very handsome long-legged Pyrenees boy is Bear, and he is a sweetheart! Bear loves people, he is sweet and smart and so lucky to be in rescue now. Bear ended up with a lousy owner who let him roam his entire life. He was not cared for and rarely fed. He was finally taken in by a Good Samaritan who contacted the owner who did not even want him back. Bear is a little shy because he has not had a lot of socialization, but so sweet. Remarkably, he is house trained and did fantastic with all of the dogs in his temporary home. Kindly, they reached out to rescue for help with him as he turned out to be heartworm positive. He is being treated for that now with the slow kill method and should make a full recovery. Bear is so happy to have regular meals and people paying attention to him for once. Although a very sweet boy he will sometimes emit a low growl around the food bowl around the other dogs, but this is probably since he went without food for so long. We are not sure if he is ever been around cats but he did well when he met a cat in boarding. Bear will need an understanding foster or adopter who will work with him to teach him everything he needs to know. He does well on leash and he is neutered. He loves to play with other dogs both big and small. He is a young boy and he was especially fond of a smaller bouncy female dog who lived with the folks who found him. We don't think he had ever lived indoors before but he did remarkably well and couldn't wait to go into the house with the other dogs and hang out with people. Bear is a great boy who needs a kind person to teach him the ropes. He will make a great dog for some lucky owner. He can be a bit shy in new situations, but warms up quickly when he is shown kindness. He deserves much better than he has known so far and we are all thankful he is safe in rescue!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Sweet Darla now! Bottom right is Darla before coming to the shelter.\n\nDarla and he friend Prince came to the shelter together from a cruelty case. Poor Prince was trapped on a chain without food, water or proper shelter and was slowly starving to death.  Darla had escaped her chain and was able to scrounge the area for what she could find, but she didn't abandon her buddy Prince! Thankfully someone noticed their condition and called the Baldwin County Animal Shelter to request a welfare check. The AC officer was able to confiscate both of the dogs from this heartbreaking situation and bring them to the safety of the shelter. Yes, the owner WAS charged! A couple short months later, they're healthy and ready for adoption!! \n\nDarla is approximately 4 years old and 60-65 pounds. Darla is a very sweet and loving girl that seems to be good with all other dogs. She LOVES to play with her buddies in the play yard, but she loves to stop for affection from her humans just as much! Darla and Prince are *not* bonded and do not need to be adopted together. During her time at the shelter, Darla has realized there's more to life than being pursued by male dogs while she was just trying to survive. And our silly Prince doesn't always have great manners when it comes to showing his love of the ladies. ?????\n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. Heartworm test (including first 30 days of prevention) can be added for an additional $20.\n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today!",

Casey is a loveable Pyr (possibly) basset hound mix who is looking for a family to shower him with love! Casey is a good boy who is working hard to Pyrfect his basic commands. He is house trained and has good recall. He loves to meet new people and play with his canine buddies. Casey loves most things including his toys, belly rubs and food...all food :) He\u2019s very food motivated especially when there is cheese or peanut butter involved. Casey is very sensitive to things around his neck, which may be a result of some past trauma, so he prefers to use his harness when he goes on walks. He does well with kids but would prefer a home with older human siblings who will understand his sensitivity around his neck. Casey is looking for a medium energy home with lots of love to give. He has never met a stranger and is very submissive to his furry friends. He is a goofy, loveable boy who loves to lay on his tummy with his legs straight out to cool off! Casey will make the Pyrfect addition to any loving home - apply for this sweet boy today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Obviously he was never taught any manners in his previous situation or allowed to play and be happy like he is now. So we're sure that after he is neutered and has someone willing to put a little bit of effort into his manners, he will make a wonderful companion! He's already come so far, he just needs someone to take him the rest of the way!\n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. Heartworm test (including first 30 days of prevention) can be added for an additional $20.\n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today!",

She would do best as the only pet in the home and with children over 10 years old. We would also recommend having a dog run or fenced in yard- she will follow her nose! She would be an ideal companion for someone who enjoys getting outside for walks, and following that up with snuggling up on the couch. She loves being with her people. Daisy Mae qualifies for our Senior Incentive Program.

Max really wants to be part of a family again and would make a wonderful and friendly addition to your home.\nMax is neutered, heartworm negative, UTD on vaccinations, dewormed & microchipped. He is crate trained. Unsure if house trained (because of the other dogs and just too much going on.\nFor more information contact: lastchancepetrescue-dickson@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Hey everyone! My name is Pop, I am somewhere between 5 and 7 years. I weigh in at about 85 pounds, I am not a small pup, but I am still a lap dog if you let me be! My previous owner did one of those fancy DNA tests and it says I am a Staffordshire terrier mix, all I know is I have a hard head, a great personality, a goofy smile and I love treats!\n \nOriginally I came to Louie's Legacy due to hurricane Harvey down in Houston. After a bit of time with my foster family, I found a new forever home with an awesome guy who loved to take me on long walks and give me endless love and snuggles. Sadly, he passed away in August so my original foster family stepped right back up to take me back so I would be with familiar people. Well, now I am back and available again, I do have a few eccentricities though. \n \nI do not like wooden floors, they scare me. I try sometimes, and I have been making great strides with my foster family since they have a huge wooden floor in their house,  maybe you can help me get over that fear. I also have a bit of a bad habit of guarding my food and toys, not all of the time, but that means I can be a bit unpredictable once in a while, so it is best if I go to a home with no other animals that might upset me if they took my food or toys. It is also a good idea if I am not in a home with kids under 13. I like kids, but they pull on my tail or tug my ears or hurt me and take my stuff, and sometimes I just don't like that and I let them know, and it gets me in trouble. \n \nSo, if you have a comfy home with carpets or at least not all wood floors, no other pets so I can have all of your love, no little kids under 13 and want a puppers that will show you endless love and attention, then let's talk. My foster family loves me to death, I even sleep at the foot of their bed every night, but they feel I deserve a forever home, maybe you can be the one to make that a reality for me. \n \nI look forward to meeting you, and you falling madly in love with me. \n \nSincerely,\nPop                                                                                                                                                                               PS-my adoption fee is $250.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Pony is medium to high energy and will do best in a home with a fenced yard where she will have space to play and run. Poni loves to run in the play yard and is large so she will need a good size fenced yard. She has been friendly with the other doggies and kids in her foster home but does not do well with alpha females. She would probably be happy as an only dog where she can receive all of person's attention. This pretty girl is about 1 year old, spayed, and weighs a hefty 85 lbs according to her foster. We think she is a golden/lab retriever mix.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $250 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

            "description": "Update: Georgia was fostered for a short period of time by a lovely couple with dog experience and here is what they had to say: She is a woman's only dog. Extremely skittish around men. When approached with harness and a leash she will growl and nip and cannot be bribed even with treats. She may never learn to walk on leash and just be happy as a couch potato. She followed the woman everywhere she went inside and out. She does go outside to do her business and on a potty pad. She likes to sleep and cuddle in bed under the blankets. *** The rescue believes with paitence and understanding and time that all things are possible. She seems to hang back while on leash to be able to see what you are doing. We are happy to offer the support of our trainer and find Georgia a more suitable home. These people really NEEDED a dog that had leash manners and that is ok. This is why we let peopel foster. \n\nGeorgia O'Keefe is from our Artist Family. She is almost 2 years old. She came from a \"not so nice home\" and adjusting well. Georgia needs a home that is rather calm and someone is home most of the time. She needs someone with time and patience to help her gain confidence and trust with people. Once she knows you, she becomes a happy, friendly girl. She needs a person of family to show her love, how to be a dog, and and to take her on fun adventures. Goergia O'Keefe once said, \"I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life - and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.\" Our georgia has a slight underbite and it makes her a little self conscious, but to us it is actually adorable especially when she smiles. If you are looking for a new addition to your family and have the time and patience to give a dog a second chance at happiness, then make an appointment to meet our girl, Georgia O'Keefe.\n\nAdoption fees include: Spay or Neuter, All vaccinations are up to date, and a microchip. If you have current pets we do allow a two week trial period for $25. This allows us to make sure that the animal will fit in with the resident animals.\n\nCome meet me!\nWe would like people to fill out our pre-application form here: https://forms.gle/uLhPh6h8Ghg73TRt6\nOnce these forms are reviewed, we will contact you to make an appointment for an in person meet and greet. We are doing our best to be fair and work with our limited staff and rescources. \nCountryside Rescue is open by appointment.",

I am good on the leash (I love a harness), sweet - playful and a bundle of fun. Come and meet me today. I will need to be the only fur child in the house. Did I mention I know all my basic commands and then some, and I am very potty trained. I am a super intelligent lady. I would also do best in a home with no young children, as it can sometimes take me a little time to build trust with new people. I hope to make your acquaintance soon! \n\nMy adoption fee is now fully waived thanks to a generous sponsor! \n\nI'm currently in a foster! If you'd like to meet with me please reach out to my foster at (928) 380-6338!\n\nBonus Perks of Adopting a Foster Dog:\n- Extra time spent working on potty training!\n- Insider info, like how I do being home alone and what I'm like at night!\n- Extra training time given to house manners, like greeting visitors!\n- My foster can give you tips on all my favorite things and least favorite things!",

            "description": "Rocky is a handsome, well-behaved fella that loves to spend time with our volunteers! He's a pittie/terrier type mix, approximately 65 pounds. Rocky walks great on a leash, sits and shakes on cue and knows basic commands. He keeps his kennel clean and is possibly house trained as well. But since he came in as a stray and was never reclaimed, we do not know his history or background. Unfortunately we do know that someone cropped Rocky's ears extremely short at some point, but we still think he's adorable!\n\nRocky is a really good boy, that would do well in most any household! (Any dog can be tested with cats upon request.)\n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. Heartworm test (including first 30 days of prevention) can be added for an additional $20.\n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today!",

Overall she can be summed up as a goofy couch potato and serious snuggle bug. She LOVES going on walks but since she does react to other dogs she needs to be muzzled at ALL times when she is outside without a fence. Miss Nova is completely muzzle trained and doesnt miss a beat when putting it on and struts her stuff while wearing it.\n\nFrom her foster:\n- She is an absolutely perfect passsenger in the vehicle; she just sits in the front seat and chills on rides.\n- She likes to nap on the couch or on her dog bed in my bedroom. \n- She loves squeaker toys and her benebone.\n- She likes playing fetch but doesn\u2019t release the ball very well lol. Kinda gotta pry it out of her mouth. But she doesn\u2019t get aggressive when you go for it.\n-She stays in her room at night that her kennel is in when I go to sleep.\n-She gets apprehensive when mail carriers/delivery drivers show up so I just keep her in her room with the door closed when I leave for work/errands.\n-When Nova meets new people in my home I have her sit and hold onto her collar when they walk in. I tell the person to talk so she can hear their voice and then I let her go and she\u2019s all about pets and violent tail wags. :)\n\n*To meet Miss Nova please complete the link below for our adoption application. A meet-and-greet will NOT be scheduled until your application is approved*\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIhm84ql5mGPbUco-8Qx9k6382EfrXopjGbqUeFWDEcOKxRg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&fbclid=IwAR3TczVxF4BB1SabaOpjwWUsGT49dpWzo_h0S0lr1jBFiYi6ZgD5EXOfgl4\n\nWoof Lodge & Rescue\nSection 501(c) (3) charitable organization \nEIN 81-2020408\nDATCP #474883",

He does just fine with one eye though and has no more pain. Shadow had all his shots, and is neutered. \nHe is ok on leash but enjoys off leash walks very much. And has great recall . \nWhat you can\u2019t train he has lots of, unconditional love, desire to please, wants to play with all other dogs, nonstop wagging tail, loves to cuddle.\nIf I could read his mind I know what he is thinking when he first wakes up. Smile on his face, tail wagging, happy vibe.\nThis is awesome I get to spend another day with my human.\nYes, Shadow has had a rough go. Has been dealt some bad cards along the way but his spirit and joy are contagious and never ending. He holds no grudge and his ability to forgive is a lesson to all.\nIf you are the kind person that has been knocked down a few times, been kicked by people who were supposed to love you but you wake up every day with a bounce in your step and a kind hello to everyone you meet then you have may have just found your forever sidekick in Shadow.\nIf you can find the space in your heart to get to know this walking, tail wagging angel, I would like you to meet him.\n",

Her main care taker passed away and the other is not able to physically care for a Great Pyrenees.  She is housetrained and somewhat leash trained, but not crate trained.  Rosebud is a big girl at about 98 pounds.  Rosebud prefers to get all the attention from her people and needs to be an only dog.  It is unknown how she does with cats, but likely best in a cat free home.  She may be too excitable for younger children.  She is not bothered by loud noises and is wary of strangers at first (she is a Pyr!).  She will dig in the yard if looking for mice or toads!!  If not contained by secure, visible fencing, Rosebud WILL go walkabout.  Rosie is a failed livestock guardian and needs to be an indoor family pet.\n\nRosie is spayed and up to date on shots.  Secure, visible fencing is almost always needed or adopt from NorthStar.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rosebud, an adoption application, site visit, secure visible fencing, and an adoption fee are required.",

After a long stay at the Emergency vet, he is now back with us, and he is a joy!\n\nHercules is a polite boy who accepts to be crated, but loves to be with you. He is extremely affectionate when he opens up, but is initially afraid of new things and men particularly. He is a lady's special - we think he would thrive in a household with only women, with gradual introductions to men. \n\nHercules likes to play with other dogs. He is silly and clumsy, so no seniors, disabled dogs or toy breeds. \n\nHercules weighs a little over 40 pounds, and loves toys. He is potty trained as long as he is given enough opportunites.\n\nHercules is already neutered! You can apply here, especially if you are shorter side!\nrebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt",

I might do okay with older kids but it would be a good idea for me to meet them first. I have done well with a female dog, but I can be a little pushy, so I would need a tolerant friend. Am I the right boy for you? **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. You can include multiple animals you are interested in on one application. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

            "description": "Landon is a cute adorable fluff-ball of love. He's gregarious, an instigator and will run circles around your other dogs. He likes to sleep in bed with his foster mom and will calm down after about a half hour to go to sleep. He hates to be crated. He is up to date on his shots and microchipped heartworm negative and weighs about 13 lb. He just got groomed and was a very good boy for the groomer. Landon was surrendered by his owner because they were moving. Landon needs a home where he knows that he won't be discarded.  He will follow you everywhere, and loves to be with his people.  He knows how to sit and is housetrained.  He learned the doggy door immediately - very smart little boy!  No small children under the age of 12.  Landon tends to nip when he's happy and excited - he will nip human legs if they are running.  It's not a mean bite, at all but it does hurt!  He just needs to learn boundaries, especially with other dogs.  He plays very rough and could potentially hurt a tiny dog.  After being in his foster home a few weeks, we are now thinking Landon would do best as as an only dog, or with another dog his size who also loves to play rough.\n\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.  Required registration of microchip in owner's name is $11.99.\n",

I had twisted my leg and injured it and luckily the kind people at Partners For Pets came to my rescue to save me. My leg has healed up but I'm still looking for a forever family. I'm also deaf but that doesn't keep me from anything. I still play with my dog friends and have a great time at the shelter but I would much rather have a forever family. I would love to play with some kids or other dogs and think cats are ok too. Would you consider adopting me?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

He is very loving with people and a total cutie. He is a Rottweiler mix. \n\nDiesel LOVES people!  He is very sweet and likes to play tug or fetch with his person.  All he wants to do is be loved on.  \n\nHe has lived his life as an only dog so he would do best as an only dog.  However, he is doing well at daycare in a small group of playful dogs.  He does not do well in a large group as he gets overwhelmed so he will not be a dog park dog.  He also does not do well if the dog is TOO energetic.  We have not had him around young children but would be fine with older kids.\n\nDiesel will need a home with a 6ft stockade fence.  He came to us because he was jumping the 4ft chain chain link in his previous home.\n\nDiesel is house trained. \n\n?If you would like to adopt Diesel and make him a part of your family, please apply at FYDRadopt.com!\n\n? Don't want to adopt another dog but interested in fostering Diesel, please apply today at foreveryoursokc.org/foster-application/! You can see our dogs in need of a foster at ForeverYoursOKC.org/dogs-needing-foster/\n\n? Want to see other dogs we have for adoption? Check out ForeverYoursOKC.Petfinder.com\n\n?

            "description": "Cable is a 2-year-old Pit Bull Terrier mix who weighs 60 pounds. His number one goal in life is to give love to every human he meets and he is an amazing Couch-Snuggler! He enjoys long walks and is training nicely in puppy manners (sit, down, stay, and leave it). In the house he can get a little mouthy during game time and until that is corrected, we recommend homes with older children. He is also working on leash reactivity (loud yelping and lunging at other leashed dogs barking at him). His reactivity is not aggressive, it is just that he was not appropriately socialized on leash walks. He sleeps and takes his meals without issue in his crate and gets along with other dog in foster home. We do not know how he is with cats.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cable please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

Rocky is a curious, sweet and playful boy who can easily go from \"play mode\" to \"cuddle mode\" depending on your mood. He lives for water-play in the summertime so if you have a pool or like to make trips down to the beach, this is your guy! His greatest hits list includes: great with other dogs, curious/friendly but respectful with cats, house trained, kennel trained, neutered and UTD on all vaccinations.\n\nRocky was heartworm positive when he came to us, but he's already undergone treatment and will (hopefully) get the all-clear negative test in 2021. If not, AJL will cover the cost to continue treatment. Rocky would do best in a home without younger kiddos as he's a big boy that jumps when he gets really excited.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/17/20\nReason for being in rescue: Owner release/owner going into assisted living\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Addy is highly allergic to fleas - she must have good flea control year round. She may also have other allergies. Her new family will watch her carefully for seasonal or food related changes and adjust accordingly. Addy was spayed and had a dental polishing on 11/27/20. She is now ready for her forever home. ADDY DOES SHED.\nWeight: 9.3 lb\nHeight: 10 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $349\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Addy is accustomed to a stay at home person and she misses that. Addy's forever home has someone at home during the day (work-from-home family, home-school family, etc.). She is a young, active dog who is looking for a more active than lazy lifestyle. Addy can be needy and wants your undivided attention. She can be a little testy when other dogs enter her space. Given this, she is best suited to be the only dog in her forever home.\n\nAddy is looking for a family that that will see past her sometimes shy exterior for the heart this girl is looking to give her family. Addy does shed.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Friendly and sweet, Addy is longing for a home again. She loves to climb up into our bedding storage areas and find a soft spot to snuggle down in. The job Addy wants is BFF. She is a happy, affectionate and loving little girl who years for a family of her own. Her goal in life is to be your best friend, your go-to girl, the one you want to spend time with.\n\nAddy can bee shy in her own way. She is not a dog that we see doing sports or even being a therapy dog. Though she can be shy, when she's with family, with those she loves, she's everything you're looking for and a family pet. She is energetic, playful, and loves to be held and cuddled. Addy is food motivated - and can get quite vocal about meal times.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: We do not know Addy's exact birthdate but her owner thinks she is about 5 years old. We've given Addy the birthdate of 11/15/15 based on this information.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

APPLICATIONS WHERE YOUNG DOGS ARE LEFT LONG HOURS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED .\n\nPLEASE KEEP IN MIND THESE PUPS ARE RESCUES, THEIR BREED MIX AND BIRTH DATES ARE UNKNOWN BUT WITH THE HELP OF OUR VET WE MAKE THE BEST EDUCATED GUESS. MOST OF THE PUPS ARE IN FOSTER CARE DOWN SOUTH WITH A RESCUE GROUP THAT WE HELP \n\nCurrently in Kentucky\n\nSweet as a candy bar, this is Hally an 8 month old, purebred chocolate Labrador Retriever. She currently weighs 60# but will likely grow more and attain around a 70-80# weight. \n\nA high energy labby that has not had much of a life until coming into rescue, is much like a 2-year old toddler---VERY busy and into EVERYTHING! On a scale of 1-10 she is a 9.5!  \n\nHally LOVES WATER of any kind--ponds, streams, muddy puddles (as you can see in one of her photos) so a home life that includes access to water (or snow) on a regular basis is a plus.  She is a very sweet girl and loves to give kisses.  \n\nTHIS DOG IS IN KENTUCKY and will require:\n\n* Home with a physically fenced yard\n*Need a home more rural in nature, no apartments/condo/small house or city environment\n*Needs strenuous daily exercise morning/noon/night to burn off energy. \n*A home with children over the age of 12\n*Needs  at least an hour run/walk both am and pm and play time in the yard.  \n*She would benefit from doggy daycare but NO DOG PARKS \n*Someone who has time to do obedience, she is a jumper and needs leash work \n*Someone who is home more often than not\n*Hally is a very sweet girl and is a true submissive so she will need a home with a dog that isn't too dominant and intimidating or to be an only dog.\n*No cats!\n\nOn a scale of 1-10 she is a 9.5!  \n\nA dog like this will require her people to be home more often that not with a 4 hour limit on time alone at the least for the next year.  If your pre/post covid life doesn't allow for that, then this isn't the dog for you.  If you are excited to have an exercise/outdoor activities companion that loves you unconditionally, then HALLY IS THE DOG FOR YOU!!!  \n\nGHR ONLY ADOPTS TO ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF 25 AND PUPPIES TO  PEOPLE WHO HAVE TIME FOR THEM. WE DO NOT ADOPT TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 5.\n \nIt doesn't matter where the pups are from; it only matters where they live the rest of their lives. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at www.goldenhuggs.org, this is the first step in the process. The adoption fee is $585 which includes spay or neuter, shots  age appropriate and transportation to the New England drop off points. For more information, please contact  info@goldenhuggs.org.\n\n",

Reno is looking for a quiet home with a predictable schedule where he can relax and nap the day away. Reno does great with his dog and cat foster siblings but he can be anxious in new environments so young children would likely be stressful for him. He likes to stay close to his people so if you're looking for a work from home buddy - he might be the guy for you! Does he sound like a good fit for your family? Please email info@alexandriaanimals.org to set up a time to meet him in his foster home.\n\n**Thanks to a generous donor, my adoption fees have been paid!**",

I would do best as an only dog and in a home with no small children. Children 13 years old and up would be best.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I need to be an only dog. I am house trained and also, muzzle trained. I really like my crate, as well. I like to go inside my crateand it helps me to feel safe. I know all my basic cues and I'm a very smart girl. I walk well on leash. Sometimes, I am a bit reactive to other dogs.\n\nDoes Ellie Mae like other pets?\n\nI'd do best as an only dog. I'd also like a home without cats. I am okay with chickens.\n\nDoes Ellie Mae like children?\n\nI'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and up.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I love squeaky toys, rope toys and plush toys! I'm still learning how to play fetch.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd love a home that has a calm environment. I'd also like to be the only dog. I'd enjoya backyard to run and play in.I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and up and no cats, please. I also want a family who loves to cuddle, but also lets me have my own space when I need it.",

He also enjoys Benebones and bully sticks when he can't get outside or a good kong stuffed with bannana's and kibble. \n\nBruno was pulled from a local shelter where he stayed there for over a month and sadly that has led to him being a bit nervous and cautious with other pets. \n\nThis sweet pea is very gentle and kind but is still learning not to jump on people and we would recommend no little kids due to his potential to accidentially knocking anyone down. \n\nIf you have the patience, activity level, and a large fenced yard - Bruno would love to meet you! We know Bruno has ton's of love to give to an amazing family.\n\nPlease note, Happy Feet Pet Rescue is a foster based rescue. We do not have a physical building that you can visit. If you are interested in meeting one of our pets, please complete an adoption application on our website: www.happyfeetpetrescue.com. We schedule private meet and greets appointments with approved adopters only. \n\nhttps://www.happyfeetpetrescue.com/",

We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Bullwinkle! He came into the shelter late November 2020 a scared and lonely boy. He is now in a foster home and coming out of his scared shell daily. This can be very common when they come in...nothing normal, familiar, new people, smells, environment, noisy, etc. He is super precious and doesn\u2019t mind being rubbed and loved on. He is around 3 years old, received his shots, and will get neutered prior to his adoption day. He\u2019s a small pocket pittie who will\nMake the right person or family a fabulous pup! Call the shelter and a meet and greet can be arranged. \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

            "description": "Loving, playful & affectionate, everyone meet our #Queen #WiggleButt Ms. #Nala. She's 4 years old, 55lbs, and an American Staffordshire Terrier mix. At the end of the day, Nala is honestly just the biggest lover that you'll ever meet. Nala craves human companionship, loves her daily walks, enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, lives for belly rubs, she's all about cuddles & movie nights & loves to give big kisses. She's 100% potty trained, 100% crate trained and does well on a leash.  Nala knows all of her basic commands and is very eager to please. The perfect family for Nala would be one that is active, loves the outdoors, an avid runner or someone who loves going on daily walks, and definitely a family that loves cuddles & puppy kisses.\n\nWhen it comes to people, Nala loves everyone she meets! She loves & adores children and would make the perfect family pet. She'd do best in a home with kids over 10 years of age because at times she doesn't always understand her strength. Nala would thrive best as the only dog in her furever home, although she has made a few friends while in our care. Nala does not do well with female dogs,  but does well with submissive male dogs with a proper introduction. But once again, we would like her to be the only dog in her forever home. Nala absolutely adores the cat that is currently in her foster home- especially when it comes to cuddle time.\n\nAdoption Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- Needs to be the ONLY DOG in her new home\n- Nala would thrive best as the only dog in the home, but does do well with most submissive male dogs & does great with the male cat in her current foster home\n\nWant To See More Pics:\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog/nala-50060051/mi/ferndale/pro-pet-otic-foundation-mi1050/\n\nNala is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue located in Metro Detroit. Her adoption fee is $150  & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Nala is currently on both flea & tick prevention and has had her ProHeart 6 Injection for heartworm prevention. \n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n\nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

Maybe you have the most amazing loving FOREVER home for this beautiful girl?! Stop by for a visit with her today and adopt her into your heart and home! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

Bella loves to chase the ball but she is not so good at bringing it back, she loves her belly rubbed and will roll over so you can give her a belly rub, loves to go for walks, loves to run like the wind, is a good car rider, wants to be with her person, is a great watch dog, prefers men over women and just dreams of a human to love her. Bella would not do well in a home with lots of people coming and going, and she would be best with no other animals. Bella is truly a diamond in the rough. Bell is now fully vetted, vaccinated, spayed and chipped. Our vet felt Bella has had at least one litter of puppies. We are looking for a home that won't dump this girl ever again and give her the love she deserves. Bella has had some formal training as she knows sit, stay, down and more. Bella will need an experienced Doberman owner and fenced yard. Bella is now fully vetted, but we had learned prior to coming to UDR, not one of the three past homes were responsible enough to see that Bella received any kind of vet care when they temporarily owned her. Sadly was passed from home to home \"Free\" on Craigslist. Our vet felt Bella possibly has already had a litter of puppies in her past. Bella does tend to bond quickly to one person and she will for sure be very loyal to that one person who she can trust. Bella is truly a diamond in the rough.  Initially fearful of new things we have been working with her and feel she is ready for a foster or adoptive home to continue where we started with her. Please apply to foster or adopt if you have a fenced yard, no other pets and a home without a lot of activity.",

Watch him cutely prance with his prize bone as he searches for its perfect hiding place. https://youtu.be/jnSdymVIoMk\n\nGomez is a true romantic, affectionate, and has a healthy appetite for life. Born around June 2017, his ideal weight is around 100 pounds of gorgeous fluffiness.\n\nGomez (as in the Addams family) was found as a super-skinny stray. He quickly showed his big, happy smile. He doesn't jump on people, and is well-mannered in the house. He is pretty mellow for the most part. He can be a little goofy sometimes, but usually displays his mature side.\n\nHe is so cuddly! He loves getting attention and lots of petting. He adores interacting with his people. He is good with kids. He is happy to meet and be hugged by every single child he meets.\n\nHe is enjoying learning how to play with other dogs, and he has been having fun playing with his new furry friends in his foster home. He gets along nicely with all of them - male, female, large, medium, small. They are teaching him that toys are fun!\n\nHe could be happy in a forever home with other dogs that he likes. He could also be happy as an only dog in the right home.\n\nHe loves to run! He hopes for a family that will keep him engaged in their lives and understands that he is sometimes lazy, and sometimes gets bursts of energy.\n\nHe needs a sturdy six-foot fence. Sometimes he gets excited about something he hears or sees on the other side, and he digs to get out. A wooden fence might be best, but it definitely needs to be 6' with a latch he can't open.\n\nHe is an avid barker! He warns you of possible intruders for days after they have gone - even if the interloper was just a dog he didn't want to be there! He will continually remind folks working next door that there is no trespassing on his property.\n\nGomez is house trained, crate trained, and rides nicely in a car. He walks really well on-leash. He is not much of a barker, only warning sometimes at things he can see on the other side of the fence.\n\nGomez should not be placed in a home with cats.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

Flip was already neutered when he was at the pound so we know that someone had been taking care of him. Why in the world was Flip at the pound?? Flip gets along with all of the other dogs and he loves everyone that he meets. \nHe is almost 2 years old and weighs 45 pounds.\nFlip would be a great addition to an active family with a nice fenced yard to run around in.

            "description": "This precious girl is Molly!\nMolly is a very young, high spirited mix breed pup. Thought to possibly be a Husky and Bulldog mix, she is very sweet and smart. Molly enjoys being around people and is very social. She also gets along great with the other dogs at the shelter. A Good Samaritan took her in after finding her abandoned at a local gas station. As they were unable to keep Molly, they surrendered her to Save A Pet in hopes of helping her find the best life possible. Molly is a medium to high energy dog who would probably do better in a home without small children. She needs some basic obedience training and sometimes jumps on people when meeting them because she is just so excited to make new friends! If you would like to learn more about this beautiful girl, please call the Save A Pet shelter at 478-994-3882. Thank you!",

            "description": "To adopt please fill out an adoption  http://www.happydogrescue.org/Application595.html\n\nSadie is a 3yo female Great Pyrenees/lab mix who was rescued as a stray in Memphis. Friendly, well-socialized, gentle. Sadie is recommended as an only dog. Typical of the breed, Sadie is choosy about her dog friends; she gets along with some dogs but not all dogs. Not recommended for cats because she likes to chase them. Recommended for children 12 years and older because little kids make her nervous. Medium-high energy level outside, quiet and well-mannered in the house.  Housebroken.  Learning basic commands.  Loves to be with her people.  Good on a leash, rides great in the car. Sadie has a limp and our vet says Sadie's rear L leg was injured in the past, probably hit by a car, broken in 2 places, never treated. But despite the limp, Sadie gets around very well as you can see from the video. Healthy and fully vetted, current on shots, spayed, weighs about 85 pounds.  AWESOME Pyr mix will make a wonderful companion for an active family who loves the breed.\n\nHere's a note from Sadie's rescuer and foster mom:  My husband and I had this sweet girl wander into our yard early November. She has a distinct limp, was covered with fleas and ticks and was full of intestinal worms. We were unable to find her owner and believe she was intentionally dumped.  We took her to our vet and she has now been fully vetted.  She is heart-worm negative and is worm free and no longer has fleas or ticks.   The vet took x-rays of her back leg and she was obviously hit by a car at some point and broke her femur and tibia.  Unfortunately, this was allowed to heal without medical intervention. She now has a limp because one leg is shorter than the other.  Our vet has recommended that she be treated with joint supplements and physical therapy and that this would probably be a lifetime issue. We introduced her to our pack (three rescues), and one of our female dogs did not interact well with her.  She never seems to instigate any issues with other female dogs but will react and defend herself.  This broke our hearts because she's sooo sweet!  She is so wonderful, and we all just want the best for her. \n\nTo adopt please fill out an adoption  http://www.happydogrescue.org/Application595.html \n\nContact us at reply@happydogrescue.org\n\nVisit us at  http://www.happydogrescue.org",

            "description": "Cyrus is a stunning 6 year old pure bred bi-color German Shepherd Dog. \nHe loves to play fetch and loves to play and wrestle with his canine friends in his foster home. \nCyrus is a Velcro dog. He needs to be with his family indoors or out. \nCyrus has excellent house manners.  He is fully housebroken, crate trained when needed. He will chill around the house on a rainy day and not drive you crazy to want to play. He\u2019s happy to play or to sit and chill indoors. \n\nCyrus is good with adult cats that are not afraid of him. However, he will chase kittens. So we do not leave him unattended when we have foster kittens. \n\nSadly Mr Cyrus has killed a goat he can no longer be trusted around livestock. \n\nCyrus needs a home with an EXPERIENCED HANDLER. Someone that knows the breed and knows how to handle this amazingly intelligent dog.  \n\nHis one flaw is that he barks when he gets excited. I mean he barks a lot. Then his excitement will die down and he\u2019ll stop and be the amazing dog we all know he is. \n\nCyrus is neutered, microchipped, fully vaccinated and is heartworm negative.\n\nAvailable now!\nAdoption fee $350 plus tax\nFostered in Plano\n\nInterested in adopting?? please go to our website and complete an adoption application today www.dfWGermanShepherdrescue.org \n",

We were found as stray and about to be parents when we were able to come to this nice rescue. We are looking for a new family that will love us both as we really love each other and can't be separated. This is what our foster mom says about us...\n\nDash and Daisy are DONE with being parents!?? They are ready to be empty nesters and never look back. They are bonded, eat together cuddle together and look for each other and whine if the other isn't around. They are both beagle mixes, roughly 25 lbs, and between 1 and 2 years old. Dash is house trained and Daisy is still working on it. She's had a lot going on taking care of the 5 babies. They love other dogs, cats and kids. We are still working on manners, so kids under 5 are probably not a good idea just because they might get knocked over. They are pretty high energy, and have the beagle bellow down pat. Due to these 2 reasons, they would not be a good fit in an apartment setting and require a 6 ft privacy fenced yard to burn some of that energy off. These two are absolutely precious and just want to love their people all of the time. They are incredibly special pups and whoever adopts them will be so lucky!\n\nIf you would like to meet Daisy and Dash send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back to you a quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...both spay and neuter, heart worm tests, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, microchips and wellness exams\n",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nLuna is a beautiful 2.5 year-old Black Lab mix spayed female who lost her home along with another dog when her family was having a baby and no longer wanted the dogs. We can only imagine how confusing it must have been for Luna to have lost her home but she is making the best of it and looking forward to starting over in a true forever home. Luna is very friendly with people but we have found that she can be particular about her dog friends so does need to be the only dog in the home. Luna has had excellent crate manners in her foster home and is very likely to be housetrained although we can't guarantee that she won't have a few accidents in her new home as she gets used to the new routine. She will sit on command for a treat and likely knows more commands that we haven't discovered yet. Luna can also catch treats on the fly like a pro. She can be reactive with other dogs when walking on a leash so would do best in home in a quiet neighborhood or rural area where she'll have a yard with a secure aboveground fence. Luna does have a high prey drive and will also try to chase squirrels and other small critters when on a walk. We wouldn't be comfortable placing her in a home with cats. Luna loves her squeaky ball and looks forward to a new home where she can safely run and play to her heart's content. Luna weighs about 60 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Luna. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Luna and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Sweet Josie was found as a stray near Lake Sinclair in Baldwin County and unfortunately never reclaimed. She's more than ready for a family to love her! Could that be you?\n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. Heartworm test (including first 30 days of prevention) can be added for an additional $20.\n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today!",

            "description": "***Thank you for your interest in Magnificent Mutts and Meows. We hope everyone is saying safe during this challenging time. Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nRanger just arrived! Turned into a local animal shelter when his owners said they did not have time for him. It was clearly obvious to the shelter that he had had zero training in his young life. Approx 2 years old and 70lbs Ranger does need a strong handler. GSD or working dog experience needed. As with any dog up for adoption we recommend obedience training to make Ranger be the best boy he can be! We know at this time he does need a fenced in yard so - no apartments/townhomes/condos for this hunk, and any children in the home should be 10+ due to his mouthiness and exuberance! We do also know no cats, or small dogs for Ranger. He would do best as an only dog.\n\nMore information and additional restrictions may be added once he fully settles into foster care and we learn his full likes and dislikes.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE SUBMIT AN APPLICATION (see location below). ONCE APPROVED, WE CAN ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE AND APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING.\n\nThis little guy has a hard time posing for pictures. He's a total love bug and wants to show his affection every single second he's near you!!! He loves giving kisses and snuggling.\n\nChip is an 8 year old mix breed pup. He's sweet and gentle even with the kitties. He's small enough to be a lap dog and big enough not to be a tripping hazard. \n\nChip was recently neutered and working on his house training. He is crate trained, good on a leash and great with a fenced in yard. \n\nChip is currently fostered with other small dogs, cats, and older children. Chip loves them all. \n\nIf you feel like Chip would be a warm welcome for your home please visit empirerescure.org and fill out your application today.

Her adoption would be finalized after she is spayed when she is around six months old. WSRH covers all shots and spay surgery at our vet.\n\nSirius\u2019s adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds and lifetime microchip registration. A deposit of $100 will be required and will be returned after Sirius is spayed.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sirius, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: www.wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names.

He is available to go to his furever home on a foster-to-adopt basis with his adoption to be finalized after he is neutered when he is around six months old. WSRH covers all shots and neuter surgery at our vet.\n\nLupin\u2019s adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds and lifetime microchip registration. A deposit of $100 will be required and will be returned after Lupin is neutered.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lupin, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: www.wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

It may take her a moment to warm up to you, but once she does, she will try her very best to be your favorite lap dog! Sheila wants what every dog wants, a safe and comfortable home where she can be loved. Because she was neglected, Sheila is a sensitive girl and is looking for a patient adopter who will give her time to open up and adjust to her new home.\nWe do not know how she is with cats but will do best as the only dog.\nSheila is a German Shepherd and her DOB is 5/26/2019. She is spayed, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, and takes preventative flea/tick/heartworm medicine.\nAs with all our dogs, Sheila must be an indoor dog.\nIf you are interested in adopting Sheila, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com.\nIf you cannot attend your scheduled visit, kindly text or call the volunteer you are meeting with before your scheduled visit. They are taking time out of their day to meet with you. Thank you!",

            "description": "WANTED: A special foster home for a boxer girl in need. Could it be you or someone you know?\n\nDelilah is a 2 year old boxer female that has been diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. She needs a home where she can recover and we can get her condition under control so that she can eventually be adopted. She has already made improvement under vet care. She still poops 8 or more times a day but in almost all cases will tell her human she needs to go outside. She has only had a few accidents in the home and no longer needs diapers. Due to her condition she is a bit underweight at 36 pounds.\n\nOther than the ulcerative colitis, Delilah is an amazing dog. She is exceptionally good with both adults and kids, and gets along well with other dogs (we aren't sure about cats). She walks nicely on a leash, and is otherwise housebroken, but she is not yet crate trained. Delilah bonds with her human and wants to be with them as much as possible, she even refuses to dine alone and will need company while she eats.\n\nWCBR is looking for a foster that can commit to Delilah's care. This includes taking her to all needed vet appointments, administering medications, following a strict diet 3x per day, and willing to log changes and improvement in her care. Fortunately, we have an amazing volunteer with experience with this condition in dogs that will be available for questions and advice as needed. Someone that is home often and will not leave Delilah alone for more than a few hours is key.\n\nWCBR will cover the costs of her food, veterinary expenses, and any special supplies needed for her care.\n\nIf you may be able to provide the foster home Delilah needs, please submit a WCBR Foster Application via our website, www.westcoastboxer.rescue.org/adpot, and also email angela@westcoastboxerrescue.org to let us know about your interest. Feel free to share this post with dog-loving friends who might be able to foster Delilah.\n\nHelps us get Delilah home! WCBR and Delilah appreciate your assistance!\n\n** Please note: West Coast Boxer Rescue does not adopt female dogs to homes that already have a female dog.\n\nGet to know us:\n\nhttps://www.westcoastboxerrescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WestCoastBoxerRescue\n\nTwitter: @wcboxerrescue\n\nPlease follow us on our Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/WestCoastBoxerRescue.",

Well, get ready for that to be a normal part of our life together. You smiling. Me smiling. We are bound to have very sore cheeks I think! \n\nI'm full of joy and love. It's a safe bet that we will hit it off right from the start! I meet people in a friendly way because I'm a confident boy. I enjoy affection, being close to you, and making you proud.  I'm one of those sorts of dogs that gets along well with everyone. I hope you like to give belly rubs because I love to get them!\n\n I \"sit\" very nicely for treats when asked and I know \"off\". I will get into my bed when it's time to go to sleep, or you're welcome to have me sleep with you if you like. I also take the treat gently out of your hand too. I even am learning to \"shake\". I have a lot of decent manners already so you'll have an easy time training me (hint, keep yummies in your pocket).\n\nI'm independent too: I like chewing on a Kong filled with treats, a rubber \"stick\" and cuddling on the couch. Once I get comfy in my surroundings I will have more and more fun playing with toys. I really, really, really want to find a family of my very own. I'm so excited about the possibilities! Have you pictured me in your home with you? You have? Awesome! Let's meet soon and make some plans together. Love, Spot-a-kiss",

She wants to be friends with every person and dog who passes her on the street and would be a great dog for a family with other dogs. On every walk people compliment her beautiful blue-grey coat and loving temperament, which is just as visible as her fur.\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so don't let location hold you back)!\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

Tasha loves people. She will need a home that will keep her on a leash or with a high fence. She loves to run. Tasha is in a home with other male dogs and does well with them. She would need a meet and greet with another dog to see how she does. We do not recommend her to a home with cats. Tasha does have a prey drive like most huskies do. Tasha is on the schedule to be spayed, is now up to date with her vaccines, microchipped and has tested negative for heartworm. She is working on housebreaking in her foster home. Her adoption fee is $350.00. If you are interested in adopting Tasha, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog a loving furever home.\n\nAnd now a little message from Jazz herself...\n\nI\u2019m ready to find my furever home. I\u2019m 13yrs young and weigh 18lbs. I\u2019m looking for a calm home with a fenced yard. I like to be outside, even in the snow. I also need long walks. They help me stay young! \n\nI\u2019m a quiet girl who would make an excellent home office companion. I promise to sleep at your feet for those endless hours of zoom meetings. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to find a home that has another dog. I really do enjoy the companionship of a dog sibling. I don\u2019t mind sharing my home with cats either. I\u2019m just an all around good girl. \n\nI can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you want to meet me you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n\n\n",

However, when separated from her siblings she cries all night.  She may be better with other dogs if not adopted together with Ricky - they are inseparable almost and it will be preferred if they get adopted together. She will be a medium size ( 45-60 lb) dog when grown.\n All siblings are about 8 months old now( assumed bd is April 2020). \n\nAll basic vaccination is up to date.  \n\nPresently all are fostered in San Bernardino County.

He is a young, energetic boy that loves to play and and would enjoy a big backyard to run in.  Apollo is potty-trained and knows his basic commands.  He would need to be the only dog in a home, but he has a lot of love to share.  He loves to cuddle and thinks he is a lap dog. \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our dog adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n\n",

He can't hear you. But can respond to the tug of his leash,  he's very mindful of his surroundings and what's going on, so it's just a matter of that he can't hear.\n\nCooper enjoys car rides and tummy rubs Cooper can\u2019t live with small kids, only homes with kids who are 10 years old or older, because he can\u2019t hear them coming and he might get startled.\n\nYou have to be willing to take the time to work with him,he would probably be great if he learned a little sign language it's different than having a regular dog because you call them back, so you have to be mindful of that. \n\nHe can't hear you, so a little bit of training for him would be perfect and would just do best in a home with someone who is willing to give him that time and attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He really has a way of wanting everyone around him smile and enjoy life from his point of view without being imposing.\n\nHe's active, athletic, engaging and genuinely happy. You find yourself smiling along with him every step of the way.\n\nBleu is an adventure fiend, and would love to have a doggy companion who wants to romp and play with him. He could coexist great in a home with small and large dogs that are READY TO RUMMMBBBLLLE but also know how to just chill and hang out sometimes. He would prefer not to live with cats.\n\nAs a deaf dog, he's very well adjusted and trusting of his handler. He bonds quickly and loves completely. He is everything a two-year-old boy should be, full of life. He will benefit from a home and family dedicated to his continued success and he will thrive as he continues to learn more as he so smart and engaged with his humans. \n\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip with free chip registration\n--Free wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet\n \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online. You can also email us at adoptions@lostourhome.org.",

            "description": "Looks like: Terrier Mix\nMale, 10 years old, 15 pounds\n\nThis fella is a love bug. He adores people, and was previously best buds with a cat! They used to play together! He enjoys playing with kiddos as well. Snix is peachy around other dogs, too. \n\nSnix has a lot to say when he is excited. He does tend to be barky, especially in the car. We think he might learn to stop that with someone patient who can help with his training. We have not seen him barking while alone; it is a reaction to him being overly excited. \n\nSnix was diagnosed with oral melanoma in November 2020. He had the melanoma removed and went through two months of cancer treatment with Dr. Arteaga at Animal Cancer Center. He is now done with his treatment and is cancer free! \n\nOur hope is that he goes on to live a regular life span. He is looking for an adopter who is willing to give him all the love he deserves for the rest of his life knowing that he is a cancer survivor. \n\nSnix came to us because his senior guardian moved to assisted living facility.",

He is also great with kids!\n\nHe is crate trained and will often go to his crate to relax without being asked.  He is still working on house training and only has the occasional accident.   \n\nHe walks great on leash and is not reactive to other dogs.  \n\nCurtis is very accommodating.  He will walk at a steady pace if you like to power walk, but he will also slow down and patiently wait if he\u2019s walking with a slower senior dog who likes to sniff a lot.  He is very calm in the house, but will also get energized and frisky at playtime.  He lives in foster with a larger senior male and they get along very well. \n\nCurtis is a little shy at first, and it took him a few weeks to come out of his shell.  But he now likes to run and chase balls and cuddle in your lap.  He will make a great addition to any home because he is very easy going and friendly!\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Big Red! This handsome, 2 year old Dogue de Bordeaux clearly has a past he needs to work through as he is very unsure of life right now. It is evident he has not been treated well. Big Red will need a quiet home with no other pets and no children as he slowly learns to unwind and come out of his shell. Big Red will be undergoing heartworm treatment and will be evaluated for any other needs while in foster care. We will be updating his profile as we learn more about this sweet boy.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

If interested in Ink, please submit an application on our site, www.mountainrottierescue.net.  The reason for rehoming can be explained to anyone interested.

            "description": "Hey there, pitty lovers! Please let us introduce Diamond.  If this pretty girl could talk, she\u2019d tell you that her past hasn\u2019t shined very brightly.  She was rescued after being observed lying in a ditch for three days by passersby.  Finally, a kind couple stopped to pick her up and brought her home with them.  No one knows how she got in the ditch \u2013 or why she remained there.  She was terrified so it\u2019s believed that someone pushed her out of a car.  Thankfully, she was not injured\u2026just very scared.  She has since been well loved in the home of her rescuers while she waits for a place to hang her leash forever.  \n\nDiamond is about 3 years old and weighs in at 71 pounds.  She\u2019s an American Staffordshire Terrier with beautiful blue/black coloring.  She is an affectionate high energy girl who loves attention.  Her foster family adores her and would love to keep her, but they have two resident cats and Diamond thinks cats are for chasing or chomping on.   They are giving her very good care and a safe home, but she has to spend much of her time outside or kenneled and they want a better life for her.  Her strength and rambunctiousness would likely not be a good combination for a home with small dogs, but she gets along great with her foster family\u2019s large dogs and loves to play with them.\n\nThis girl is truly a diamond in the rough with the potential to sparkle in a home with the experience and time to devote to her training.  Primarily an outside dog, she\u2019s working on her house manners and does well inside as long as she\u2019s taken out regularly.  Her leash skills are in need of work.  She is a strong girl and tends to pull.  Her foster mom says she\u2019s a sweetheart who wants to please her people and, with patience and practice, she\u2019ll get it down.  Her best home will be with adults only, or teens. Though she would not intentionally harm anyone, she can jump high when excited and could knock over young children.  A home with fenced yard would be ideal.\n\nDiamond has been spayed, is up to date on vaccines and micro-chipped.  She\u2019s also on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  If you are a bully breed lover and have the time and experience to give this girl her chance to shine and live the life she deserves, please contact Chris at rescue3@earthlink.net for an application and she\u2019ll send one right out to you.  Her adoption fee is $300. She\u2019s waiting for you!\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.net/pawsclawsnewengland\n",

He spent a couple of months with a splint on and now he's ready for a forever home.\n\nFRANCO is a young, athletic dog who responds well to a confident leader who has the time to help keep this \"busy\" dog engaged.  We think an adopter with a yard who is active and has experience with \"training\" would be ideal for Franco.  He is young and unlearning habits such as \"jumping up\" so we recommend a home with older children. \n\nWith dogs, FRANCO is playful but has a rough and rowdy style and can get himself in trouble - just like with humans, he would do well with an older confident dog who can teach him some manners.\n\nFRANCO is about 65lbs and currently at our kennel in South Gate. He is crate-trained, neutered, micro-chipped and current on vaccinations. If you are in the Los Angeles area and interested in meeting FRANCO, please fill out our brief online questionnaire (copy and paste link): www.downtowndogrescue.org/adoption-questionnaire\n\nAdditional Downtown Dog Rescue information email: adopt@downtowndogrescue.org or call: 818-407-4145\n",

            "description": "Manny is a senior gentlemen. He doesn't mind being carried around, he loves to be scratched, pet and receive kisses but he doesn't kiss back. He loves to cuddle on the couch or in bed. He will also cuddle in a dog bed with soft blankets. Manny doesn't have any use for toys. It's his person that he wants. I'm his foster mom for now and he is everything I just said and he's got a ton of love to give his person. He's always close, follows me around the house, nudges me to pick him up so he can get on the couch with me. He smiles and runs around me with the other dogs when I come home. Manny is not a barker. He will give a loud howl when a big dog approaches him, he's afraid of large dogs. He's fine with other dogs his size, he basically ignores those dogs along with any cats he sees.\n\nManny will make a wonderful companion for any adults who are home most of the time that want a dog that will love and adore them.",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving adoption applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with an approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nDuey transferred to us from another shelter where he was surrendered by his owner who had originally adopted him. Duey is a gentle giant with a lot of sweet and happy to share. While he has a quite charming personality and demeanor, Duey would do best in a home without small children as their grabbing, crawling and unexpected noises may make him nervous. His ideal home would include adults and children over 12 years of age, a tall wooden fence for safe exercise, and the ability to handle him on a leash--he is a very large boy. Duey is more than ready to find his forever home. Duey's estimated DOB is 11/16/2014. He weighs about 116 pounds. Duey is house/leash trained and seems to understand several commands including sit and stay.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

Virtually all of your questions will be answered by following these instructions: \n\n1. Go to our website www.rescue4all.org \n2. Thoroughly read through the HOW TO ADOPT tab\n3. Thoroughly read through the OUR PROCESS tab\n4. then fill out an online application from your laptop or desktop computer or click on the mobile friendly link on the application page.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPancho is a large mixed breed male, not sure how old he is.\n\nPancho was a neglected street dog in Guadalajara...no name...no family...and was in extremely bad shape.\n\nHe just happened to collapse in front of the right house to find the perfect person, Melissa who is a rescue dog advocate, a Rescue4All supporter, and the manager of The Urban Canine North. She was down there visiting family. \n\nAfter a lengthy recovery, he was flown from Mexico to Spokane thanks to our amazing supporters at Urban Canine!\n\nHe has lived a life of survival on the streets which, not surprisingly, has left him with some issues with other animals. \n\nWe got him tested for heartworm & tick born illnesses which was all negative.\n\nHe had to have part of his left ear amputated because of the necrotic tissue.\n\nHe has been neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, and microchipped.\n\nHe has some significant muscle atrophy on the left side of his face that we are trying to figure out the reason for, but the wounds on the side of his head and his ear have finally healed.\n\nWhat we know about Pancho is that he is amazing with humans, he loves attention and just being with you. He loves soft beds and being warm. He is great on a leash and just wants to be safe. \n\nMORE ABOUT PANCHO:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/rescue4all/posts/3460412020707154",

I have a lot of energy to use up so my ideal home will have active humans that can take me on lots of adventures! While we're out on these adventures we should probably work on my leash manners - I have a tendency to pull because I get so excited. When we're lounging around at home I would love an endless supply of toys, especially the ones that challenge me like puzzle feeders and Kongs! I know my perfect humans are out there somewhere. Please take me home today! ~ I am full grown at 50lbs. ~ **I am currently being treated for a chronic skin condition - please speak to an adoption specialist for more information.** Cats/ Dogs? I want to be your one and only. Children? Unknown. Housetrained? Yes. Training needs? To start, I need help with my leash manners and jumping then we can learn sit. Energy level? Medium to high. How did I get here?Transferred from Wake County Animal Center due to my current skin condition. ~My adoption fee is $95.00.~",

Zeus was surrendered when his person lost their job and could no longer afford to properly care for him. He is now looking for a new family to love and care for him as he deserves to be. Zeus is a big boy and quite peppy for his age. He will chase a ball with the cutest old man run. He loves to take walks. This boy loves people and is so friendly with everyone. Zeus is missing some hair and appears to have some allergies that his new family would need to be wiling and able to deal with that. We are told he isn't good with other animals but he's awesome with kids of all ages. He comes to you house trained and having lots of experience living in a home. Adopting a senior is so rewarding and easier than adopting a younger dog. They require little exercise but do expect the same amount of love. Senior pets are often overlooked in a shelter and so are black dogs so Zeus has two strikes against him. He needs a hero to step up and show this old guy that he still matters. You can meet Zeus by calling 757-385-4444 or clicking on this link to make an appointment https://www.facebook.com/VBAnimalCareandAdoptionCenter The shelter is located at 341 S Birdneck Rd, Virginia Beach, VA.",

            "description": "Milo is a 2 year old Pug Chihuahua mix who is active, cuddly, and full of personality. Milo loves to play fetch with furry squeaky toys, and be outside. Milo was left outside a lot with his littermates, and is afraid of people now. He is wary of every new person he meets, and it takes time for him to warm up but once he does, he is a sweet, smart and loving pup! \n\nMilo had no training prior to coming to our rescue so he is still learning to walk on a leash, and is working on learning commands. Milo is house trained but will need to be watched for marking when he first moves into his new home. \n\nMilo is a slow to warm up guy who\nneeds an adopter with experience. He can be growly if cornered when he doesn\u2019t know you. He only takes a day or two to fall in love with his people and is worth the wait. He doesn\u2019t have much experience with the world so is easy frightened on walks, will sit down and refuse to move at times. If approached by strangers when on a leash he will try to get out of his harness and run. When scared he barks and growls. \n\nMilo is growly and scared with kids. He uses his mouth when he is excited and can nip or mouth you to get your attention. We solve this by giving him a small furry toy to hold to keep his mouth busy. Milo would do best in am adults only home or one with patient teenagers. \n\nHe likes to think he is the head of any pack he is a part of so will do best with submissive other dogs. He would be happy to be an only dog as well. He chases and plays too roughly with cats though he doesn\u2019t intend to harm them. \n\nMilo is crate trained, comes when he is called, and is a pretty independent guy. He is pushy with his love, climbing right on top of you and pushing everything and everyone else out of his way. We expect he will learn to be a little more polite with consistent training. Milo would love an active family who will patiently share the big world with him. He is great in a car!\n\nWe prefer an adopter who will meet him in person prior to adoption in our Columbia, TN rescue home. \n\nAll dogs adopted are spayed/neutered, vaccinated including Rabies if over 14 weeks, microchipped, fecal tested, heart-worm tested if over 7 mo at arrival, flea/heartworm/tick preventative given monthly. Dogs are in foster homes in various locations but we are located in Columbia, TN. All dogs can be transported for free to adopters in the US and Canada.

I'm housetrained, great during bathtime, and a lover of cuddles, hugs, and peanut butter! Who isn't? I love people so much! With dogs, I can be choosy and cats are a no for me. I\u2019ve been neutered, made up to date on all necessary vaccines, microchipped, and tested negative for heartworm. I weigh 56 lbs and have an adoption fee of $210. We are first come first serve, so if you\u2019re interested, you can visit me at CHS in the Weiss Dog Run. We are open from 12 to 6 PM, Tuesdays through Saturdays, and process our last adoption at 5:30 PM. If you have any dogs currently, a meet and greet is required to make sure we get along. Please make sure they are up to date on their rabies and distemper vaccine as we require that proof before a meet and greet. See you soon!",

            "description": "This beautiful BIG boy is Max. Max is a 3 year old Purebred Siberian Husky. \nMax originally came from Arizona Humane Society as a second chance rescue. He was scheduled to be put down due to lack of training and inexperienced people interacting with him. For this reason , he will only be adopted to someone who has experience with  Northern Breed dogs. Max is an EXTRA LARGE boy weighing close to 80+ pounds. He is not a good fit with children because of his size and lack of training . \nMax is very sweet with HIS people. He will do best in an active single person, or couple home. He would be a great hiking, or jogging partner. Max is very dominant with other male dogs. Please text 6238263085 to set up a meeting with Max. Adoption fee $185",

She has been to the vet and bloodwork came back normal so we are unsure what triggered the seizures. She has not had one at the shelter from what we have seen. She also has bad teeth, but will be receiving dental work. \nLily is getting older, and her hearing isn't as good.

I eat way too fast- it appears that I had a pretty rough start in life- so I eat from a puzzle bowl to slow me down.\n\nI am probably better off as an only pet, as I want all of the affection I was deprived of early on, but I would be open to meeting another male dog my size.\n\nA home with older children or adults-only would be ideal for me, as I can be excited when I am happy. After all, I probably didn't have much to be excited about before.\n\nShelly is currently being fostered in Staten Island, NY.

Elvis is also kid friendly. Elvis came to us heartworm positive but has completed his treatment. He will need to be on restricted activity a little bit longer but then he'll be free to be wild. The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00 + tax and that includes their vaccinations, spay or neuter, rabies and microchip. Our dogs are also heartworm negative (or we will cover their treatment). To start the process please visit our website and fill out the adoption application (www.dfwrescueme.org) and from there the foster family can answer any questions and arrange a time to meet.",

I can't stands no more!\" Becky showed up here at Marley's World Dog Sanctuary with me and that's what Paw said. I was found in Sydney working the crowd at the Pioneer day parade for something to eat. That was so long ago I hardly remember starving and getting ate alive by fleas and chiggers and skeeters. All someone had to do was look at me and I cowered. Not so much anymore. Ill do anything for a pat and a cookie. I  have great leash and basic obedience skills. I probably always will be a little unsure of myself but Paw says I'm a lady and ready to move uptown. The other kids tease me and say I'm just a homely old hillbilly but Paw says I'm beautiful and when the right person comes along they will see it too.

A meet and greet would be required for another dog in the home. He usually is too busy checking out his surroundings to ever want to look at me for a photo. He can be quite the escape artist so he would need a secure location to roam. \n\nWww.griffinpondanimalshelter.com/adopt",

I'm Penny Jo, but some of my friends call me PJ.\n\nI'm a happy, silly girl that just wants love and attention from my person. I LOVE toys, balls, ropes, and bones. Stuffed toys are my favorite because they are SO much fun to de-stuff!\n\nWhen I'm not playing with my toys, I like to take a good cozy nap. I really like to cuddle up next to my foster mom so she can pet me. I love to go for walks and play outside, but I sometimes pull on my leash a little too hard when I'm excited so that is something I will need to continue to work on.\n\nI know basic commands like sit and down and I know how to shake and ask (bark). Sometimes I get so excited about the treat you are going to give me or the toy you're going to throw that I start to ask (bark) for it before you tell me to.\n\nI sleep in a kennel during the day and I am potty trained. I don't always love going into the kennel, but as long as you give me a treat I'll go right in. I like to go for rides in the car too. I like to sit in the back seat so I can look out the windows, but if there is no one in the passenger seat I like to come up front when you stop and go back to the back once you start moving again.\n\nI am particular on my doggie friends and I need slow introductions to new dogs I meet. I like playing with my foster sister, but on my terms. She is a puppy and likes to annoy me all the time wanting to play, but I ignore her and then when she is calm and laying down I approach her to play for a few minutes.\n\nFrom Penny Jo's foster mom:\n\nPenny Jo cannot be around other animals when there is food is present (human or dog food). PJ is great on her own with food, but she will steal it if you leave it unattended. She will need to eat her meals in her crate or in her own space.\n\nPenny Jo is an awesome dog that wants to please her person. She takes correction very well and is very smart and would love to learn more tricks to make her person happy.\n\nDate of birth (estimated): 6/9/18\n\nGood with Dogs: Slow introductions required - dog selective\n\nGood with Cats: No\n\nHouse Trained: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $250\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting this animal, please read the following before submitting an adoption application on our website - fureverhomerescue.com.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, 4Dx test (covers tick-borne diseases ( A naplasmosis , Lymes, E hrlichiosis) as well as heart worm) & de-worming. We ask that our dogs live indoors unless otherwise stated & agreed upon. Applicants must live in MN within a reasonable distance from the Twin Cities Metro Area. We do not adopt out of state.",

            "description": "Kerri has made some major progress in the last month! She now comes when asked and loves hanging out with her canine companions. She's quite mischievous and LOVES her soft toys. She is often seen carrying around a squeaky toy and proudly showing it for all to see. Kerri is food motivated and with the right person will come out of her shell with time and patience. She's becoming less fearful every day.\n.\n5/27/20: Well they must be related haha! Kerri has also discovered the benefits of dog beds this morning!\n.\nKerri came in to a shelter partner as part of a litter of feral puppies. Three of these dogs were unable to be placed locally which is when we were contacted. She has had very limited human interaction and will need a confident, patient partner going forward.\n.\nWith time and patience we have no doubt Kerri will make an amazing companion for the right home. She will need another confident dog in the home to help teach her the ropes.\n.\nShe will not be placed with kids or in an urban environment. She has been exposed to cats with no issues. We will post more information as we get to know her, so be sure to check back! \n\nPLEASE READ our procedures for adoption prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. If you are looking for additional photos, video, or information on this dog, you will likely find that by searching our facebook page for their photo/description album.\n.\nPlease see our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n.\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time.

            "description": "Mickey is yet another example of what happens when a smart, driven dog has nothing put in his head. He is bright, active, funny, smart, and completely untrained. Mickey is continuing to learn about training, socialization, and partnership. So far Mickey has made great progress with his resource guarding and now prefers to play fetch instead of keep away. Mickey is soooo smart and picks up new cues in a flash. Mickey has been exposed to agility equipment and seems to love the sport. So far, Mickey has loved every dog he has met and enjoys playing chase. \n.\n**Mickey will ONLY be offered to an experienced training, active, or sport dog home who is willing to continue training, socialization, and impulse control. He will not be placed with kids or cats.\n\nPLEASE READ our procedures for adoption prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. If you are looking for additional photos, video, or information on this dog, you will likely find that by searching our facebook page for their photo/description album.\n.\nPlease see our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n.\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time. The same dog may later become available if the adoption falls through. \n.\nOur website www.mabcr.org will give you details on our adoption procedures as well as an application for adoption. An application must be submitted prior to 'matching' an adopter with a dog as all dogs do not fit into all homes. We pride ourselves in our adoption process, we take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can place a dog with them that they can enjoy for years to come.\n.\nPlease understand that we will not discuss dogs with individual adopters until after the application process is completed.\n.\nOur rescue does not have a public facility, therefore there are no visiting hours. Appointments to visit with the available dogs are made after the application process has been completed by our staff.  \n.\nTo assist any dog within the MABCR organization, please consider making a donation to the general fund or to the medical fund. All dogs coming into our rescue are fully vetted (s/n and core vaccines) prior to adoption.\n.\nRescuing animals is quite expensive. If you are unable to adopt, but would like to help this, or any other animal in our system, please consider a sponsorship donation. \nFor information on our sponsorship program, please contact Sarah at SLR@mabcr.org. \n.\nThank you for your interest in Mid-Atlantic Border Collie Rescue.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is SImba.  I was one of 9 puppies born after our mommy was pulled from a very high kill shelter in Houston, TX (on the day she was to be put to sleep, as she was very pregnant with us, and they had no place for her).  I was born 10/7/2016.  My siblings and I have been trying to find homes in Houston since we were little, but it is very hard to find people there that want to take care of us the right way.  We sat at hundreds of events, and people would say how cute we were, but we never found our places.  That is when the rescue started placing others in the Seattle area.  I just arrived here a short time ago.  I have one brother and two sisters that have found their homes, so I decided it is my turn to give it a go.  I am a tad shy.  I am really really sweet and loving, I just need time to get to know you and trust you.  Our mommy was of a nervous temperament, and I think we naturally are that from her.  My 3 siblings that went with their families recently, both have both required patience and loving support.  I hear they are doing great now, but they growled and were very timid the 1st few days\u2026 I\u2019m sure I will be the same way.  We have had a lot of changes lately.  Once you give me a chance though, and I trust you as I do my foster family\u2026 I become a real ham.  I love to play.  I love to sleep with you.  I love to hang out and do whatever you are doing.  I do fairly well with going potty where I should as long as you keep me on a bit of a schedule.  I know how to use potty pads or go outside.  I am fairly small, so we little ones can only hold it so long though.  I probably won\u2019t ever be great with small children, as they are not too familiar to me, except a few bad experiences at adoption events. I do ok with other doggies as long as they are not too intimidating, but I probably won\u2019t ever flourish at daycare or dog parks.  I am happier just being around my person/ people.  I don\u2019t mind kitties\u2026 my foster family has a few\u2026 some like to play, some do not\u2026 I have learned to stay away from kitties that tell me they do not want to play, and I give them their space.  Well, that is all for now\u2026 time to go play.  Let my rescue people know if you\u2019d like to meet me, and after you fill out an application to be an approved adopter, they will schedule a time for us to meet each other.  Oh, I am fully vetted and up to date on my healthcare too.  \n\nAdoption fee:  $500",

He likes some other dogs, especially smaller ones, needs a mellow house without a lot of commotion, he does not bark, loves his bed, will sit outside on the lawn all day and enjoy the sun. Alec is neutered, up-to-date on all of his vaccines and is microchipped. He cannot be in a home with a cat or kids!!\n\nHe loves to hike, he is an old soul, and never complains. This guy is so cool and will make a great addition to the right family, is that you???",

            "description": "Meet Sammy! This little love bug is just\nthe sweetest girl you'll ever meet! She's an almost 6yo, 52 lb. terrier mix looking for a new home due the stress of a new baby in the home. Sammy is loving, loyal and will happily snuggle up with you in bed or on the couch with a smile on her face (check out her videos for proof). She enjoy naps and down time as an adult, but she still has a lot of energy. She loves to run around (especially when she has a case of the zoomies), is almost always down to play (any toy you get for her will never go to waste!), and loves a good long walk, hike or even a short jog! She loves checking out new places and does well in the car and on road trips. She has the cutest little satellite ear and wagging tail when you talk to her!\n\nSammy\nhas fantastic house manners and loves to show off her basic commands for a treat (sit, stay, up, lay down, etc.) Her favorite special treat is peanut butter and she loves a good back scratch. She also has a few funny quirks such as loving to roll around in the grass on a sunny day and loving getting towel dried after a walk in the rain or a bath (she hates getting wet, but loves getting dried off!)\n\nShe would make a great companion animal or family pet for a family with adults only.\nSammy\nloves her people and would do best in a home with someone who is around a lot. She can get very excited/playful around other dogs, so she would do best in a home with adults and no other pets or another very calm, uninterested dog (no cats).\n\nWhile Sammy is not a LOVEPAWS dog, we will be helping her owners find her the best home. Please fill out our online adoption application at\nwww.lovepawspg.org\nthen email Katherine at Katherine.Lovepaws@aol.com.",

He is potty trained, rides great in the car, is learning leash manners, & he is also crate trained. He is a super smart guy, ready & eager to learn and please. He will require a home with someone who is home at least part time, with plenty of exercise & room to run. Owen will do best as an only dog, but with opportunities to have play dates with other dogs. Or a home with a med-lg very chill other dog would work.\nWe adopt to all areas of Texas and parts of OK, LA, AR.\nTo apply: https://form.jotform.com/LSDR2012/lone-star-doberman-resc\nTo inquire: EMAIL US - LoneStarDobermanRescue@gmail.com",

I am really a very sweet girl but sometimes I may seem a little bit standoffish. I like to play with other dogs here on the ranch but can be selective at times as far as who I choose to spend my time with. I'm looking for an experienced dog owner who is looking for a new best friend. I would probably do best in a house with older children and I am not feline friendly. While I could easily adapt to apartment style living, I would love to have a yard or at least an outdoor space since sun-tanning and rolling around in the grass are my two favorite activities. I'd like to live a quiet life, filled with lots of days just snuggling on the couch, and don't feel like you need to take me lots of places to keep me entertained, I'm perfectly happy chilling at home. I would benefit from some further training, particularly leash training and some potty training, to help me be the absolute perfect pup!",

            "description": "Ginge is a big snuggly warm, cuddly Pittie package. Ginger is an American Staffordshire terrier that would likely be called a redhead if she were a person. She has a stunning reddish brindle coat and a sweet face that just wants to be smushed and smooched on a daily basis. Ginger is about a year or two old and weighs around 50 lbs. She wants nothing more than to be with people and would be about the best foot warmer and space heater you could find this winter and every one moving forward. Like most of her breed, she is not interested in personal space and would love to be as close as possible for snuggle time, or just about any time. Ginger LOVES kids to be her play and snuggle buddies. She is young and active and would love regular walks. With a goal of making you happy, she already knows \"sit\" and would easily learn whatever you wanted to teach and would prove a quick study who thoroughly enjoys treats and reinforcement - peanut butter is one of her favorites!\nGinger enjoys simple things, like a good chew, a good snooze, and a good snuggle. She has the cutest snore and can be hilariously stubborn, but more than anything, she is just a loving, low-maintenance pup.\nGinger has made a number of doggie friends at the farm, but would be just fine being a solo dog as she likes to be in charge of the doggie pack and in all honesty, is so wonderful in and of herself it is hard to imagine sharing adoration with anyone else. Don't just take our word for it, this pittie package is just perfectly precious and you must come meet her ASAP!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Meet Cool Dude Steve! \n\nThis guy has a look all his own and we couldn't love it more! Steve was picked up as a stray in a rural area and taken to Kern County Animal Services. This short stack was very shut down in the shelter environment so he joined the Marleys Mutts team! \n\nSteve is slowly coming around in foster care. He'd likely never lived inside a house based on his initial behavior when inside his fosters home. Now he is crate trained and doing very well with his house training skills. \n\nSteve doesn't trust quickly and if pushed too hard or if people try to handle him too fast and too much before he knows them he absolutely has the potential to bite. He has a stoic/serious personality that isn't for everyone. He can be stubborn especially in the beginning but if given the time to decompress and get to know a new person he's great with them and kind of a goofball. He's good with dogs and ignores cats. We would not recommend he live in a home with children as they move quickly and could easily startle him and cause unwanted behavior. He hates car rides but LOVES going for walks. \n\nSteve's foster mom has a lot of experience with unsure dogs so is being very selective about the home he goes to as we don't want Steve returned because he's more dog that a potential adopter can handle. He wouldn't be the right fit for a 1st time adopter. She will be taking her time reviewing each application to determine if a home is the right home for Steve. If you think you might be his perfect home apply today! If you are interested in adopting a Marley's Mutts please fill out an application at http://marleysmutts.org/adoptionprocess/",

He also has to take half an anticonvulsant pill twice a day. He would make a great addition to a loving home with humans who are willing to accommodate his special needs.",

            "description": "Meet Fancy, a 3-year-old English Bulldog/Staffordshire mix. Her story begins on the day that a team in Oklahoma saved her from the euthanasia list of a crowded shelter. They discovered she was pregnant.\n\nFancy gave birth very soon after. She had a small litter and only one puppy was born breathing. Rescuers knew that they needed to find a foster home for this precious family to be nursed back to health, so Fancy and baby made their way all the way to Nebraska and Muddy Paws. \n\nNow Fancy was sad after having a stillborn litter, and her puppy wasn't growing properly without littermates to keep her warm and help her grow strong and healthy. There were two sick puppies in rescue who had to be separated from their mother early as she wasn't able to feed them properly. Fancy took them under her wing and nursed them next to her own. She was an amazing mother and loved them all dearly. They were inseparable - playing and cuddling together every day. Once the pups were old and healthy enough to leave mom, Fancy got to meet each of their adopters before taking them home. She gave each one a kiss as if she approved and then walked them to their car. \n\nNow, with Fancy's role as a mother complete, she is waiting for her own perfect home!\n\nFancy is a very healthy girl, although the vet noticed that her body showed signs of having multiple litters in the past. Our best guess is that Fancy was an ex-breeder dog who either escaped this harsh life or was abandoned. We are happy to report that although Fancy was an amazing mother to her single daughter and adoptive children, her days of breeding are over! She continues to help foster puppies in need, but her body is finally allowed to rest. She provides only sociliazation, cuddles and love now!\n\nBeing an ex-breeder dog may explain some of her quirks. This little girl is a dragon! She has no idea what toys are, except she recognizes they are Important and Treasure. She will steal toys and bones from everyone and hide them away under couch cushions, blankets and dog beds for safe keeping. She wasn't potty-trained when she arrived, but now she is nearly 100% pottyign outside! She is the queen of the house and demands pets and love from every visitor.\n\nWalks consist of her trying to greet every person and walk up every driveway we go my. She walks on a loose-leash and is always attuned to her human. She doesn't need much exercise - this lazy girl would prefer a nice stroll through the neighborhood and then a date night cuddled up next to you!\n\nFancy's ideal home would be with a family that was home a good amoutn of time. If there are other dogs in the home, they need to be able to put up with her quirks! Dog intros are required with this silly girl. \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Fancy is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Blue will do best with a strong leader who will provide discipline and set boundaries. Blue should be in an adult only household. Daily exercise, such as jogging and sports activities, will help drain Blue's high energy.\n\n\nBlue is one year old and weighs 55 pounds.\n\n\nBlue's adoption fee is $200; he is microchipped, neutered, and up to date on vaccines. Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.",

She was seen recently by an Allergy specialty vet and she has had an initial Cytopoint injection and is receiving soaking baths hoping we can break the cycle and reduce or eliminate the itching that has probably gone untreated for a long time....but while her skin may be a little rough , her personality is still sweet and sunny to everyone she meets !\n\nUpdate : From her foster \" everyday we see more of the real Eloise.....she is a true delight!\n\nShe loves going for walks and prances as she walks !\n\nShe enjoys meeting people and dogs. Absolutely LOVES car rides .\n\nSquirrels and ducks/geese don't seem to be of interest to her and so far , she has not met any cats while in foster.\n\nShe is still dealing with some itchiness and is on antibiotics for the next few days . Kennel life can be hard on dogs so we are hoping with consistent diet and care this will end.\n\nWhen a local shelter contacted us about a super sweet girl that needed help, we couldn't say no. Look at that face ? Who could resist that look ?\n\nWhat we know is she is very affectionate , likes toys, , fine with dogs and was scared of the shelter cat she met .\n\nWe don't know what happened to her or why her people didn't look for her , but she will be in an ASR foster home tomorrow night.\n\nThe shelter treated her for skin and ear infections , poor girl , she clearly didn't have the best life before but that has not diminished her sweetness .\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com. Our adoption fee is $350.00.",

            "description": "The super handsome three year old German Shepherd \u201cZeus\u201d is a dedicated and loyal fellow who will make his new owner a fantastic companion.   Z, as he is affectionately called, is eager to please, fast to respond to routine basic commands and has successfully completed basic obedience training.   This active fellow must have a job to put his skills to use, continue to be socialized and have an environment where he gets plenty of exercise and a challenging job.   \n\nZ has had little socialization and we are working to expand his horizons.   As a result, he demonstrates some initial trust issues initially when meeting a new person if he is placed in any type of fenced or caged in area such as a kennel (barrier aggression.    And, he is fearful of basic environmental items such as a mailbox because of this lack of exposure.    However, Z is growing every day and overcomes this quickly once he spends time with and comes to trust his new human.    He isn\u2019t a jumper or climber and is quite content to remain in a fenced in area.   \n\nThe successful adopter will be an experienced German Shepherd owner with a proven record of handling German Shepherds, someone who knows the breed and is willing to invest time winning Z\u2019s trust and someone eager to dedicate the time required to hone this great fellow\u2019s skills.    Although Z has spent his entire life indoors and has not been exposed to other dogs, we have introduced him off leash to other German Shepherds and small dogs and he gets along well with the five dogs to whom he has been introduced.   He is extremely well house trained and must continue to be a dog with indoor privileges to bond with his human family.\n\nPlease go on-line, complete an application.   Phone Godbey Creek Canine Rescue for more details or to schedule an appointment.   336.972.4511",

            "description": "Cutie patootie OLIVER was taken into rescue shortly before Christmas after being found by a Good Samaritan in TN, and not a day too soon. Found alongside the entrance ramp to an interstate,  Oliver was starving and could barely walk he was sooo weak. His angel says he had a look of just giving up on life. He is doing so well now in our care that Oliver is now part of a play group enjoying playing outside for short periods because of the bitter cold. \n\nOliver is such a sweet boy who has come such a long way since initial rescue. He is eating quality food, gaining his healthy weight back, about 3 pounds so far, and is getting appropriate exercise. He has been neutered, had dentals at the same time to eliminate having to put him under anesthesia a second time, and has been microchipped. \n\nOliver is a purebred Beagle boy estimated to be about 4 to 5 years old and presently weighing 24 pounds. What a great age for a Beagle to join your family! Still very able, active and playful, but has outgrown that truly hyper Beagle puppy stage of boundless energy. The Beagle breed is a long lived breed with good care. One of our personal Beagles is 17 years old. \n\nPlease visit also our rescue Facebook page where we post updates, pictures, and videos of all of our dogs, including Oliver. Petfinder limits us on the number of pictures and videos we can post. Facebook does not.  There you will be able to follow Oliver\u2019s progress. The only applications we will be accepting right now for Oliver are foster-to-adopt to give him a home environment in which to further heal and complete needed medical care. The foster-to-adopt family will then be the first in line to adopt Oliver. And, yes, all of our Beagles are very popular and end up with multiple adoption applications. So, if you are smitten with Oliver and would like to foster his sweet self through complete vetting with the priority for being his forever family, please email Diana and dmoore2003@bellsouth.net.",

Grace is a happy, playful girl that loves to run around the play-yard and spend time with our volunteers. She also loves to play with other dogs! (Any of our dogs can be cat tested upon request.) \n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. Heartworm test (including first 30 days of prevention) can be added for an additional $20.\n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today!",

She has been taught to sit on command, she\u2019s good on a leash, and she\u2019s calm and quiet in her run. Naomi is a cute good girl and she is waiting to meet you in run 84. She is current on her vaccines, about 50 lbs, and about 2 years old. Naomi is now spayed and will be microchipped, and heartworm tested when adopted. Her ID at the shelter is 626224.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

Reba needs an adopter who is patient and will let her get settled in on her own terms,\n\nThe adopter that returned her thought that she was too possessive of her toys so the shelter feared that she may have issues with resource guarding. Their team of volunteers worked with her with a variety of toys and she had no issues besides loving to have a toy to play with.\n\nReba's a fun active girl who loves to play with other dogs and is an affectionate doll once she gains your trust.\n\nPlease submit an application if you're interested in meeting Reba!\n\nHere's the link - http://aceofhearts.wufoo.com/forms/ace-of-hearts-adoption-application/\n",

He\u2019s great with other dogs who are relatively calm and respectful of his space. \n\nHe does need eye drops several times a day, because of this and his age we are also open to a foster to adopt situation (which we normally don\u2019t do). He does snap when he knows he's getting his drops, so a muzzle might be necessary, but affection and wet food is always appreciated.",

More information to follow.\n\nMeet Hero! (Racing name Wild World)  Hero recently came to PA  from Florida. He's 1.5 years old, friendly, and loves to chase squirrels. He's getting used to living in a house....staying away from the hot stove, no \"counter surfing\", and learning how to go up and down steps. He's very smart and a quick learner--already housebroken AND trained to do his business in a very specific area of the yard! He knows the command \"lay down\" from clicker training. Hero loves his furry squeaky toy, and getting hugged and kissed by his foster mom. He'd be a great apartment dog--very quiet--just one small bark so far! He\u2019s not cat safe, so he\u2019ll need a home without cats. He was enthusiastic and sweet when meeting the little girl next door. Later this month (Dec) he\u2019ll get neutered and will be ready for his forever home.\nHis foster mom's favorite times with Hero so far were when he was laying \"cockroach\" in his bed, when he nibbled her fingers like a little kiss and every morning when he greets her with his teeth chattering in excitement. All signs of a happy greyhound.",

Based on her age & appearance, you may think she's an old lady, but on the contrary, Roxy is anything but ... She absolutely adores people and being taken out for long walks.  She is a sweet, social, medium energy girl who loves car rides, knows basic commands, and has awesome leash manners.  A fenced yard isn't necessary for this curious & spry gal because she's not super active, but she does really enjoy exploring & romping around outside so if you've got a fenced yard, she will definitely make good use of it!  Her goal is to keep herself & her family busy with daily adventures and she still has plenty of pep in her step & lots of love to share!  Roxy is looking for a calm, adult only household where ideally someone is home frequently to spend time with her.  She doesn't have separation anxiety, but she does like to have human companionship while she chews her toys and takes her daily naps!  Roxy is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  \n\nFor more information about Roxy, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Meet Kerfuffle (or fuffle for short). \n\nHe is an 8 months old (or younger), male, poodle mix. He is small, at only 5lbs, and is very likely done growing. He can be shy and a little bit snippy when approached too quickly. Because of this, he will not be approved for a home with children under 12. He does well with other dogs and cats and sleeps quietly in his kennel at night. We are working on his house training but he still needs more practice. \n\nWhen he came to us, he was starved and dehydrated to the point that he could not lift his head or open his eyes.  We were really surprised that he survived. For this reason, we will be very particular about the home he goes to. We must warn you that Fuffle is a crotchety young boy. He is not the dog that\u2019s going to go running up to a new person and want their attention. He will back away while growling and/or barking and; if you go to get him when he does not want to be picked up, he will bite you.  \n\nAt the time of adoption, he will be fully vaccinated, neutered and microchipped before going to his new home. He is heartworm negative and has been started on preventatives.  A vet reference and home visit are BOTH required for approved adoption. FUFFLE IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION WITHIN TWO HOURS OF BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA BECAUSE A HOME VISIT IS REQUIRED. \n\nKerfuffle is located in Alabama and being housed with a foster here. The adoption fee of $150 includes all age appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, current flea/tick & heart worm preventative, & microchip. You will also receive a copy of all medical records in a pet health record folder.\n\nPita & Pecan's Animal Refuge is a veteran owned and operated 501(c)3 nonprofit Alabama based rescue and all of our animals reside with us at our homes or with a foster. We adopt our animals both locally and out-of-state in order to allow us to find the best possible home for our babies of all breeds and species. \n\n",

He is a little old man at 12 years old and weighs just 3 1/2 lbs. Bugsy is very food motivated which has helped transition him into his foster home. He is a little nervous about being touched, but he warms up quickly with some yummy treats. \n\nBugsy loves to snuggle up to his special person while watching TV, or going on walks in his sling. He will welcome visitors to the home, and seems to get along fine with other dogs. \n\nBugsy has an old luxating patella in one of his back legs, which the hamstring contraction was so severe that he can no longer fully extend the leg and use it. He has been evaluated by our orthopedic and he does just fine using 3 legs. Bugsy also had his last 3 remaining teeth pulled, so he will require a soft food diet. \n\nBugsy will do best in a home on the quiet side with someone who is home more often that not. Someone experienced with tiny breeds and who has a love for Chihuahuas would be perfect for him! \n\nBugsy's adoption fee is $300 and that includes his neuter, registered microchip, vaccines current, flea treatment and deworming. Applications can be completed at www.lovebugsrescue.org",

He\u2019s 3 years old and weighs 53 lbs.  Benjamin is very friendly and very playful. He absolutely loves to play with toys! Though Benjamin is curious about cats he shows no aggression. \n\nBenjamin is also good with other dogs and loves to play. However, he can be possessive with toys and does not like humans taking toys out of his mouth.\n\nSadly, Benjamin tested positive for heartworms.  We need to get him into a home during his treatment. The cost for the heartworm treatment is covered.  We can provide you with more info about his heartworm treatment if you are interested in adopting or fostering Benjamin. \n\nHe has been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nAdoption hours at our shelter: Monday - Friday 9am-4pm, BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and some weekend hours.  To make an appointment or for more information, please call us at 913-321-1445.  If you have a dog, you can also arrange to bring your dog with you to meet our dogs to see if it's a good match.\n\nOur dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older).\n\nVisit our Petfinder home page at http://kckac.petfinder.com for more info about adopting our pets.",

Thankfully, animal control did some research and contacted us to once again care for this little girl. Phoebe is approximately 11yo and is in need of donations to help cover her medical expenses, so she can once again be a healthy little Westie girl.\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\n12-4-20: Phoebe only had to spend one night in doggie jail before we rushed to get her out. She is now at our Vet Hospital having tests and to begin treatment for Cushing's Disease. Phoebe has 75% hair loss due to Cushing's Disease.\n\n12-5-20: Phoebe is now in her foster home, receiving medications for Cushing's Disease, as well as dietary supplements to help with her hair loss.\n\nAll dogs adopted by Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc. have had a full medical exam by one of our licensed Veterinarians, which includes testing (and treatment, if necessary) for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis, all necessary vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, dental cleaning as necessary, microchipping, registration of the microchip, and any other medical needs each particular dog may need. Copies of all available medical records are transferred to you when the adoption is finalized.\n\nWe prefer to adopt to families with past Scottie, Westie, Terrier experience, but realize this isn't always possible. We do NOT ship our pets. If you have that special place in your heart, and in your home, for a Scottie (or any of our other available rescue dogs), please visit us in Dallas for an in person meet & greet session with our available dogs. If you have existing dogs, they should travel to Dallas with you, so we can be assured that they will be compatible with the new addition to your family.\n\nPlease contact us at\nRescue@scottiekingdom.com\nto receive an Adoption Application or for more information on our Adoption process. Also, please take the time to visit our website\nwww.scottiekingdom.com\nfor additional information.\n\nWe sometimes receive several applications on the same dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible, based on his/her needs, personality and past history. Please note: Adoptions are not done on a first come, first served basis. Submitting an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog. We are looking for the best available home for each of our rescue dogs.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for considering adoption!\n\nWe are\nnot\nsupported by your tax dollars or public grants, rather, we rely on donations to help us continue our rescue work for animals that are in need.\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX\n\n75355",

He is playful when hes not sleeping. He is in good health despite the rough shape he came to us in! He had a severe infection and needed a dental bad. Now hes all healed up and ready to find a good home. Blind dogs get around very well!!\n\nHe will need frequent grooming! He has a few teeth left but he's currently eating wet food. \n\nAshton is neutered, vaccinated, and heartworm negative. His bloodwork came back great- so no underlying health issues. \n\nApply to adopt at: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/92846379021159",

This lovely senior girl is in fantastic shape for her age. She does have vision limitations but is doing well overall. She is neutral toward other dogs, cats, and even new people. She doesn't care for toys and is more into comfy beds and sun spots. She loves a routine that includes going out for walks, eating, and plenty of napping. She is great in the home and her sweet soul makes her wonderful company. She can be reserved and shy with new people and things but assimilates well with routine and food offerings. A quiet home where she will be loved is going to keep this deserving girl happy.",

            "description": "This pretty pittie is Sydney. She is a 6 year old American Pit Bull Terrier who weighs 48 pounds.\n\nSydney was adopted from us in 2015 when she was a young pup. She spent over 5 years in what she thought was her forever home, so she's very sad being at the shelter for the first time as an adult. Though she is confused by her circumstances, she lights up when her new human friends at Wish Bone give her love and attention. She is a gentle girl who will sit in your lap and let you pet her all day if you'll let her. Once she gets excited, she does the cutest zoomies. We think Sydney will be very low-key in a home environment - she loves to lay on the couch and is very cuddly. She is fully potty trained.\n\nSydney attaches to her preferred human and becomes protective over that person. This means that she'll make sure you're always safe, but also means that she should go to a single person household. We aren't sure if a male has treated her unkindly in the past, but she does prefer females. She needs to be the only dog in the house, and does not do well with cats. Sydney will love you with absolutely everything she has and we're excited to find someone who will give her the same in return.\n\nHer minimum adoption fee is $195 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

I am one of 6 puppies named after the Goonies. I'd like to think I am handsome and very outgoing. You see I am only 4 months old and weight 25 lbs....I will probably be a big boy when I grow up.   My dream is for a family who will take me out for walks, play fetch, and teach me cool tricks! They say my siblings and I will soon have wonderful homes? Can you give me a wonderful home?

Niko loves people and loves to be loved. He would be great on adventures, or a walking/running/jogging buddy or as an integral part of a family - this sweet soul is meant to be a true companion. \n\n \n\nHe is a Beauty, looks like he is a purebred Husky. His coat is exceptional and his eyes/fade are very striking. He is approximately 2 years of age, and weighs 60 lbs and is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped and heart worm negative. He bonds quickly with humans and loves to play with other dogs. He is very sweet but also protective. Also he is house trained, goes to the door when he wants to go out and knows a few tricks. He is very smart. He needs some help on the leash, as he just wants to chase bunnies and burn some energy. He will wants kisses in the morning and lots of naps, sit on the couch with you or lay by the door taking in the view . He is surprisingly calm in the home for a younger dog and showers each family member equally with affection. Niko is a go anywhere, do anything or just hangout kind of guy - as long as he can share your attention and affection, he is one happy boy!\n\n \n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Say hello to Conrad! He is a good boy who is looking for a home to call his own. He is 2 years old, weighs 41 pounds, and we believe he's a black mouth cur mix.\n\nConrad is energetic, fun-loving, and sweet. He's happiest when he's hanging out with his favorite person and loves to cuddle. He will need plenty of exercise and we've found that he loves puzzle toys and things that keep his mind busy. Conrad would probably do best in a home where someone is home a good deal of the time to play with him and keep him occupied.\n\nHe has a high prey drive for cats and we assume he wouldn't do well with other small animals for this reason.  However, based on his interactions with other dogs at the shelter, we think Conrad would be okay in a home with another dog. A dog introduction would be necessary to make sure the dogs get along. Because of his energy level, Conrad requests a home with no children under the age of 6.\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

Hey you guys!! You do remember the Goonies? My siblings and I were named after them because  we are so unique and adventurous!!  You see I was born with only one eye but the vet told me that I would be handsome with one eye regardless! It doesn't bother me, I can run around and play like any other dog.  I want a family who will run, play, and snuggle with me. I love to go for car rides too and I am sure affectionate!!! I love being around other dogs and people!!!  I weight 25 lbs and  I am only 4 months old. I still have alot of growing to do, so I will need room to run. Surely, there is a family out there looking for me?  If you are interested in getting more details on One Eye Willie, please email my friends at BARK at Katybug6067@gmail.com and LongJ1003@aol.com.  Thanks for adopting to adopt!",

He reminds us of Sean Connery!\n\nPLEASE READ: Adopters will not be considered without completing an application. Please visit www.AmericanBulldogRescue.org to apply! Remember - Adoption is always the best option! If you can't help by adopting a homeless pet, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to American Bulldog Rescue, 4 Terry Drive, Suite 1D Newtown, PA 18940 or paypal AmericanBulldogRescue@verizon.net. We cannot place dogs in homes with children under 10 unless that dog has lived with kids or is in a foster home with kids. Thank you.\nTo be considered for adoption, you must apply using our free, online application. Our dogs are fostered in our volunteers' homes, not in a central shelter/location. Only approved applicants are put into contact with the foster family to setup a meeting with the foster dog.

They're a mature couple that are set in their ways. They need a quiet comfy couch to curl up and stay warm together and to be loved on. Whitey, the male Chihuahua is skittish and does not enjoy being handled unless he comes to you voluntarily. He's house trained but may have accidents when he first gets to new places. Once he has your trust he wants to be close but under the blankets snuggled up touching you. His tongue hangs out of his mouth due to missing teeth, which is hilarious.Sweetie is a female fox terrier that is house trained and does not enjoy being picked up or overly handled until she is ready.They're looking her a loving, patient & understanding family that has a quiet home with very little excitement. They would do best being the only pets in the home and no children under 14 years. They will nip if touched before ready.Completely vetted and ready for adoption.dashrescue00@gmail.comwww.dashanimalrescue.org",

I am a very sweet, loving, and affectionate boy, and I love to cuddle and spend time with people. I walk pretty well on the leash and enjoy going out on walks. I can be very picky with other dogs, so if you are interested in adopting me and you have other dogs, we might need to meet a couple times before my adoption is finalized. I haven't really been around cats, but I do bark at them when I see them through the fence. My behaviors with other dogs and cats can definitely be worked with, I will just need someone who understands me, and is willing to work with me. I would love to find a home with a family who will love and cuddle me, and will also exercise me. I really just want to make people happy, and I am very smart, so I will make a wonderful companion for someone. If you have any questions, or if you are interested in adopting me, please ask staff.\n                                                                                      Love,\n                                                                                     Orson",

I LOVE to be pet and I give the best cuddles.\n\n- I always want to be with you! Separation anxiety is something I'm learning to work through and I will need a patient and understanding individual or family to help me overcome it. My foster mom is helping me LOTS and I promise if we work on it together, we can overcome it!\n\n- Buddy me up! I truly love all dogs, small and big, and would be great in a home with a companion. \n\n- I am a young energetic boy, who will need to be physically + mentally exercised daily. When you're chill - I'm chill. \n\n- Adventure Time! I love going on walks, hikes, playing interactive puzzle games for my brain, and being taken around on fun adventures with you! I am great on leash, and even though I'm big, I won't pull you around. \n\n- I am fully potty trained, and will only go potty outside!\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

Update:  Jack's adoption fee has been partially sponsored and will be reduced to $85 + tax with an approved application.   Meet Jack!  This dog is such a sweet older guy.  He came to us when his owner went to the hospital and she could no longer take care of Jack.  Jack is a sweet guy.  He likes to go for walks and at 10 years, he's still ready to go for walks. He is currently in a foster home and he has gone on 5 mile hikes and keeps up.  He's tired afterwards but he doesn't miss a beat. Jack is good with cats and dogs.  He is housetrained too.  Jack is described by his foster mom as \"an easy dog to have around.\"  We think Jack is fabulous and if you would like to offer this guy a permanent home, please apply at www.cchswi.org \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application. Do you like me but can't adopt me? Consider sponsoring part or all of my adoption fee. This will help me get a home sooner and you can be a part of helping me find a home. You can do this by making a donation through our PayPal donation button on our website. Please note when checking out it's to sponsor my adoption fee. Thank you! DATCP License 266742-DS",

Charlie was recently returned and well he is a tad on the fluffy side. Or if we are honest he gained the covid 19 in spades. Charlie is a very sweet boy who loves women. He is not a big fan of men or kids. As you can tell he has not led the most active of lifestyles. However, it is time for change. He is ready to start the next chapter of his life. We are looking for a female drill sergeant that will feed him the proper amount and exercise him . If we can't find a drill sergeant adopter then we will settle for someone who is going to help him with his weight loss journey. He will make a perfect companion for a single. female. \n\nIf you are interested in this gem of boy, please contact Rescue Me Clifford.",

She was a stray from a local shelter so we have no history about her past.  Her front teeth are worn and/or broken so a dental procedure is being planned for her and she will require only soft foods in the future. The vet suspects she had been in a kennel or crate quite a bit and she broke her teeth on the metal enclosure.  As might be expected for a senior dog, she has arthritis in her hind end and spondylosis (pinching of the nerves) in her lower spine that affects her stride. Her pain is being managed with anti-inflammatory and nerve blocking meds and they will be required for the remainder of her time. She has some difficulty going up and down 3 steps into and out of the house. Her walks are limited to a quarter to a third of a mile.  She also can slip on hardwood floors unless carpet or runners are put down. \n\nChristina seems to prefer women over men. In her foster home, she gets fed and walked by the foster dad, but she likes to follow and cuddle with the foster mom and isn\u2019t willing to go to the dad when he calls her.  Initially she retreated to an open crate for security but would come back out for moms attention. Since the crate was removed she has integrated well into her environment and gained confidence around the other dogs. She is living with another larger female German Shepherd and a mid-sized dog in the home who seem to sense she's not feeling her best and leave her alone so they are getting along well. She is housebroken and easy to have around. She uses the dog door but with some difficulty.\n\nHer new home should be a single level home with no steps, with carpet or carpet runners to keep her from slipping.  She also enjoys thick, soft dog beds.  Senior dogs repay kindness with affection and she will be your best friend.\n\nCats and small critters are unknown.\n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our GCGSR Dogs page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\nThank you for visiting!",

I enjoy other dogs and wouldn't mind sharing my\u00a0 home with another dog I can play with, but don't much care for dogs who aren't very nice. I would also do best in a home with older kids, small kids just freak me out with all their tantrums. Did I also mention I like walks? I am working on my leash manners but I cannot help enjoying all the great sights and smells outside has to offer. Due to my love for the outdoors, I would really benefit from a tall secure fencing structure in my forever home. I love my people and promise to do the best that I can and show you all the love I have to offer for the rest of my years.\u00a0\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me please head on over to www.sweethomedobermanrescue.org/application to apply!",

She's been working on getting her girlish figure back and is looking so good! She loves her jogs in the neighborhood and is such a good girl and great companion.\n\nShe has her very own 'pink baby'. She walks around all day with it in her mouth .. it is so cute! Bruna does great with other dogs ... her and her foster sister are BFF's ... Bruna would make an amazing buddy for anyone.\n\nBruna was rescued in the woods after a three day search for her and babies. A volunteer had seen her full of milk and knew she and her babies needed help. She was completely skin and bones but managed to have puppies that were so incredibly healthy. She kept them safe from predators by finding them a safe shelter away from danger. A mother's strength is endless and they will go to the ends of the earth to protect us. That is a true testament to what kind of mother she was. \n\nNow it's truly her time to get some love. She is a very curious dog and absolutely loves long walks and squirrel chasing ... she is the only dog that I can truly believe she knows exactly what I'm saying . Once you meet her you will understand. She looks at me the entire time I'm talking to her. She is awesome !\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",
