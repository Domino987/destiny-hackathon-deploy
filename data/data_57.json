Angel herself is as happy as can be, even as she is dealing with some health issues such as diabetes and hip problems. Her diabetes is under control, but she will need to continue with regular vet care, and her hip problems are being helped with supplements. She has limited vision due to her diabetes, but that does not stop her from exploring the yard, house, or on walks.\n\nShe loves to go for a morning walk with her foster sisters. She loves squeaky toys and will even steal the toilet paper if she can find it, she truly has the heart of a young dog. Her tail is always wagging and she finds joy in the little things in life.\n\nAngel is looking for a forever family that will love her and be patient. She would do best in a home that is on one level and does not have a lot of steps going in and out.\n\nAngel is being fostered in Minnesota.\n\nComplete the adoption form here : ADOPT ME\n\n*Please be sure to read the adoption info/FAQ tab on our main website before applying for a dog.",

MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDDAH:\n1.   another confident dog in the home.\n2.  fully fenced yard\n3.  a female adopter\n4.  no children in the home\n\n7 month old male Terrier/Doxie/Chihuahua mix, about 9 pounds.\nHe is a shy guy that needs time feel comfortable with you. Once he feels comfortable with you, he is your little shadow. He seems to only be comfortable with women. Warming up to the men in the home has not happened, so we are looking for a \"hen house\" for him. He loves to snuggle and lick your face. He is a bit of a toy hoarder and will collect all the toys on his favorite bed and guard them from the other dogs. He will try to play fetch. He is very food motivated and his crate is his safe place. He has done great with other dogs. In fact, he needs another confident dog in the home to help guide him. He will go for leashed walks, but really needs the \"draw\" of another dog to help him be comfortable. He would do best in a home with a fenced yard, as walking in busy environments is a skill that still needs to mastered. He is curious about the cat and chickens at his foster home but so far he does not have the confidence to chase them. This boy will need lots of time and patience to blossom into the gem that he is!\n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Have you ever wanted a pet that loves you and your family and no one else? That will adore you and their pack, but outsiders are viewed with caution? Well meet Shirley. Shirley is semi-feral pup. She was born apx May 2018. Shirley was trapped with her siblings by animal control. It will take patience and trust to seek human company. Shirley is excellent with other dogs and seems to be just fine with cats. They will bond fiercely with their family and be a devoted and loving member of the family. All it takes is time and patience. Shirley is available for foster to adopt. This will allow Street Paws to provide all the help and support their new family needs to begin their lives together. Ferals make amazing pets with just a little time. They are normally very laid back and easy dogs once you gain their trust. A home with at least one other dog and a fenced in yard is a must. Contact us if you are interested in becoming a member of our growing Street Paws pack!\n\nIn her current foster home she lives with a Pitbull and 2 Yorkie's She has a doggie door that she uses, allows her foster Dad to let her on occasion but would prefer to come smell him when he is not looking. She likes to sneak everyone's food bowls and take them outside.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/E8A4Ed-xgUg\n\nNo out of state adoptions.\n\nTo apply to adopt this pet please fill out a Preliminary Adoption Application at http://streetpaws.org/adoption-application/. This application does not commit you to an adoption. It is used to screen those interested to make sure the home is a good match for the pet. We verify vet history on current/previous pets to ensure pets have been spayed/neutered and vaccinated annually. Our adoption fee is $250 for all of our dogs. They have been given age-appropriate vaccinations, are spayed/neutered, dewormed, received flea prevention, heartworm tested and treated if necessary, and microchipped.",

            "description": "Maggie is a 5-year old 8 lb toy poodle who was hit by a car and the driver threw her in the garbage to leave her to die in Tijuana.  Thankfully someone heard her screams for help and she was rescued, brought to L.A. and we took her into our group.\n\nDue to the car injury, her hind leg had to be amputated but she gets around well on three legs.  She is very loving and sweet and only has one tooth!  Maggie gets along with other dogs but she is an alpha personality and would do best around other dogs who are submissive.  \n\nWe are working on her house training, she is spayed, microchipped and up-to-date on vaccines.  If you are interested in Maggie, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.\n\nLOCAL ADOPTION ONLY\n\n",

Inquiries will not be answered at this time.\n\nSanta and his brother Elf came us as strays that were never claimed by owners.  They are recovering from mange currently and their hair is slowly but surely growing back.  Elf and Santa have lived a rough life living on their own since they were tiny pups.  They are about 6 months old.  They are quickly learning here that people aren't so bad after all.  They came is very shut down and now excited to see their favorite people.  All you need for these pups are treats, patience, love and positive training.  We have not tried these boys with cats yet.  Older kids 10+ may be best for these pups.  Are you really ready for all the work in raising a puppy? Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match.   Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/\n\nThe adoption fee of $250 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.\n",

His last owner wasn't the kindest to him, but that hasn't stopped him from being one of the sweetest boys on the planet! When we rescued him from the shelter he had a gouge under his eye, but it's healed up nicely now. Jack is a two year old Siberian Husky and he's a vocal lover!\n\nJack loves other dogs, but REALLY loves the ladies! He came into the rescue with his girlfriend Jill (also available if you're looking to adopt TWO!), but we quickly learned Jack is a ladies man. He loves all the ladies and would be fine in a forever home with or without Jill as long as he has a canine girlfriend. Can you say 'calling all the single ladies?' :)\n\nJack would like a forever home with a fenced yard. He loves all humans alike but hasn't been around children. He'd likely be fine with children ages 8 and older. He's fairly calm for a young Husky and has a really sweet disposition. He loves to sing and has the deepest voice! Video here: https://youtu.be/YIetjBnl5do\n\nJack can be transported for the right home. His adoption area is NJ to NC.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

Inquiries will not be answered at this time.\n\nElf and his brother Santa came us as strays that were never claimed by owners.  They are recovering from mange currently and their hair is slowly but surely growing back.  Elf and Santa have lived a rough life living on their own since they were tiny pups.  They are about 6 months old.  They are quickly learning here that people aren't so bad after all.  They came is very shut down and now excited to see their favorite people.  All you need for these pups are treats, patience, love and positive training.  We have not tried these boys with cats yet.  Older kids 10+ may be best for these pups.  Are you really ready for all the work in raising a puppy? Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match.   Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/\n\nThe adoption fee of $250 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.\n",

Adoptions are done usually on Saturdays as we are all volunteers who work full time during the week. Dogs live in private foster homes. We do not host events and there is no opportunity to view multiple dogs. \nWe will not consider incomplete applications. We will not process applications that are not for a specific dog listed on petfinder. We do not process and \"hold\" applications. We do not ship dogs and we do not arrange transports. All adopters must be present to complete the adoption. If an adopter is approved we do a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d with a specific dog or pup. If at the meet we all agree it\u2019s a good match, then the adoption takes place at that time. Their is no opportunity to meet and adopt at a later date. Again, please only apply if you are available on Saturday and ready to adopt.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. We will never promise a particular breed or adult size.\n\nWe do our best to put all info we have in the bio. We will not respond to inquires regarding information that is already detailed in the bio. \n\n My name is Tessa. I am about 3ish years old and I weigh around 45 pounds. Adoptable pets are spayed/neutered (unless the rescue Veterinarian deems the pup/dog will need to be adopted on a SN contract), have age appropriate vaccines, are current on hw and flea preventatives and microchipped. \n\nTessa resides in a foster home with dogs and cats. She is crate trained and house training is coming along. She is energetic and has enjoyed the dog park. She walks on leash but a fenced yard would be ideal.\nTessa will need to continue heartworm treatment post adoption\nat our expense at our Vet downtown Charleston. For this reason we are looking for a local adopter.\n\nAll adopters are provided with a medical summary, a new collar and leash, an opportunity to go over basic training/pet care and help shopping for supplies if needed. \n\n The adoption fee is $395\n\nIf interested in adoption please submit an application! The application is found on our home page at palmettopaws.petfinder.com \n\n\n",

MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nSTRICT RULE FOR MARTY:  He needs a fully enclosed fence.\n\n2 year old male Border Terrier mix, about 20 pounds.\nMarty is a very sweet, cuddly boy who loves people's attention. He is ok with small/medium dogs but will chase cats. Marty is VERY active and playful. He is very food motivated and may be food protective to other dogs. Marty is not a big barker, vocal only when playing.\nMarty is very curious and can be an escape artist. He needs a good fenced yard and proactive measures (baby gates) taken at doorways and exits!\nHe can be a bit of an indoor marker.\nIn general, he\u2019s young, loves to interact with people and easily motivated by treats so he is proving to be quite trainable. Owner surrender. \n\n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.",

Most all the dogs were unsocialized and Eddy was young and had hardly if ever been around humans.    \nWe went and got her in September, and our trainer fostered her to get her to understand she is safe with us.  She has come out of her shell and is such a great girl.  She loves loves loves to play and her favorite play partner is our therapy pyrenees girl so size does not matter, just fun.\nOn first meet, it may take a little bit for her to warm up to you, but when she does, she will love you forever.  Just check out the pics with the trainer's son.\nIf Eddy is the girl for you please check out our procedures below\n1. on line application\n2. vet and reference check\n3. phone call\n4. home visit\n5 meet and greet\n6. adoption\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again and that fits their personality and needs the best. No more hurt or fear.\nLink to app:\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/",

            "description": "Hi My name is Monkey and I am a 6 month old border collie mix.  I was born with a condition known as cerebellar hypoplasia (or CH).  It is a genetic condition in which the part of the brain that controls neuromuscular function doesn't develop properly.  As a result, I have a wonky walk and have difficulty with fine motor skills.  I also need help getting up if I happen to fall over on my side.  But...other than that, I am a healthy, happy, playful puppy!  I love to run around the backyard, play with toys and wrestle with the other dogs in my foster home.  When I have finally run out of energy, I want nothing more than to collapse in your lap for lots of pets and snuggles.  I don't care about cats and am good with kids.  I'm housebroken and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If you are interesting in meeting me, please contact kathie@heridnghaven.org",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nAs you can tell by his shelter name, COOKIE MONSTER was able to talk somebody on staff into giving him treats during his intake process!  This American Bulldog mix male is about 2 years old and he weighed 56 lbs. at intake in late December. He is brindle and has white markings. Notes on his cage card reflect that he is \"very sweet\" and \"knows sit.\"  So, he has had at least some training by whoever previously owned the responsibility for this pretty boy.  Go meet him!  Call to schedule your adoption appointment.  He has not yet been neutered.  Please read the important information below.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

I'm easygoing and am just as happy around my dog friends as I am cuddled up with you on the couch. \n\nI'm playful with other dogs, but sometimes I can be a little hesitant. I'm curious around cats, but I don't have a mean bone in my body! Something that makes me unique is I'm not super into playing with toys, but I love to take toys from my dog friends and make a game out of it.\n\nI'm a Velcro dog who never strays too far away from my people. I love car rides and love to look out the window when going for rides. My perfect day would include getting my morning zoomies out in the yard, going for a long walk, and then cuddling on the couch.\n\nDoes this sound like you and your family? Apply to meet me!",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nMomma to Moe Joe Surprise and Curly SurpriseMissy Sage Surprise has been given that name because she had 2 little boys a few days after being in her foster home! No one knew she was pregnant! She is an excellent mom and has taught her boys well!\n\nMiss Sage is about 2 years old and is a Black and Tan short hair beautiful dachshund mix. I believe mostly dachshund since she has shorter legs and a long body! She is very sweet but shy around people she doesn't know. She might bark right at first but when she gets comfortable she will wag her tail, roll over and beg for belly rubs! She sleeps with her boys at night, we've tried to keep them apart but she loves being with them.\n\nShe is house broken and has had no accidents in the house.\n\nShe is shy around people she doesn't know but usually warms up quickly. She is good with the other dogs in the foster home, don't know about cats.\n\nMiss Sage has had all of her vaccinations and is microchipped and is heartworm negative. She has been spayed and is ready for a forever home of her own!\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

Has no problem eating when you give it to him.\n\nWe would guess he will need some work on housebreaking.  He is ok to go outside with his coat on but without a coat it is just too cold for that.\n\nWe have him on schedule to be neutered.  His shots are current, surprisingly he is heartworm negative, is wormed and micro-chipped. \n\nHe will be available to go home on 1/14/21 but can have visitors now and be adopted.  He just can't go home until he visits with Dr. Mike to be neutered.  His eyes are clear - the picture makes them look foggy but that is not the case.\n\nHe needs an older and stable home - not small children on a daily basis. We were told he could be a little grouchy but we sure haven't seen that side of him.\n\nIn order to adopt you have to complete an adoption application - you will find that on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com under the 'Adoption' tab.  His adoption fee will be $175.00.",

He has no problem eating when you give it to him.\n\nWe would guess he will need some work on housebreaking.  He is ok to go outside with his coat on but without a coat it is just too cold for that.\n\nWe have him on schedule to be neutered.  His shots are current, surprisingly he is heartworm negative, is wormed and micro-chipped. \n\nHe will be available to go home as soon as we can get him in to see Dr. Mike but can have visitors now and be adopted.  He just can't go home until he visits with Dr. Mike to be neutered. \n\nHe needs an older and stable home - not small children on a daily basis. We were told he could be a little grouchy but we sure haven't seen that side of him.\n\nIn order to adopt you have to complete an adoption application - you will find that on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com under the 'Adoption' tab.  His adoption fee will be $175.00.",

We will review each submitted application, then contact the approved adopter via email. If that particular person has changed their mind we will move to the next approved adopter. Thank you for understanding. If you are interested please complete an application at www.arf-fresno.com   \n\nWe will be putting pictures up for Scooter later today or tomorrow. We estimate him to be about 7 -8 yrs old.  We just completed a dental on him so he is ready to start his new adventures with his forever family.

            "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE BIO ON THIS DOG BEFORE REQUESTING AN APPLICATION.  MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\n8 year old male Toy Fox Terrier, about 12 pounds.\nPierre is the funny lil man you need in your life! He\u2019s good with dogs and gentle kids. Pierre handles extremely easily and gets cute little zoomies when he\u2019s excited. He is quiet and would adapt very quickly to apartment life. This cuddlebug loves to nap and wouldn\u2019t be suited to an overly active lifestyle - but he loves walks! Although he sometimes gets into trouble due to how curious and smart he is, he learns quickly with correction. True to his Terrier self, this old man has mad hops! He can hop onto surfaces that seem way too high for a guy his size; counter tops, tables, etc. So he really needs to be watched closely or mitigated in a way that prevents such naughty behavior! While Pierre hasn't shown any aggression towards cats, he does want to play with them and may chase them when his terrier mode is activated! Owner surrender. \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\n\n",

He is overweight for a Chihuahua mix and could use some good exercise.  He has no problem eating when you give it to him.\n\nWe would guess he will need some work on housebreaking.  He is ok to go outside with his coat on but without a coat it is just too cold for that.\n\nWe have him on schedule to be neutered.  His shots are current, surprisingly he is heartworm negative, is wormed and micro-chipped. \n\nHe will be available to go home on 1/14/21 but can have visitors now and be adopted.  He just can't go home until he visits with Dr. Mike to be neutered.  His eyes are clear - the picture makes them look foggy but that is not the case.\n\nHe needs an older and stable home - not small children on a daily basis. We were told he could be a little grouchy but we sure haven't seen that side of him.\n\nIn order to adopt you have to complete an adoption application - you will find that on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com under the 'Adoption' tab.  His adoption fee will be $175.00.",

He is overweight for a Chihuahua mix and could use some good exercise.  He does love his food - advisible not to get between him and his bowl at feeding time.\n\nHe did come in and mark the place but then was more than willing to go outside and explore and finish his business.\n\nWe have him on schedule to be neutered.  His shots are current, surprisingly he is heartworm negative, is wormed and micro-chipped. \n\nHe will be available to go home on 1/14/21 but can have visitors now and be adopted.  He just can't go home until he visits with Dr. Mike to be neutered.  His eyes are clear - the picture makes them look foggy but that is not the case.\n\nHe needs an older and stable home - not small children on a daily basis. We were told he could be a little grouchy but we sure haven't seen that side of him.\n\nIn order to adopt you have to complete an adoption application - you will find that on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com under the 'Adoption' tab.  His adoption fee will be $150.00.",

There are so many things that are new to me so I will put my nose to the ground trying to figure them out! I get along with some other dogs, but I am showing signs of being protective over my food. I would do fine around children with supervision because I like to nip and jump, if I have time to get used to them I could like cats too! It would be so much fun to learn how to go for walks with you! I will need some training because I am new to everything! I can't wait to meet you to see if I could make your family bigger by four paws! I am sure that once you meet me you will think I am just the cutest puppy there is!",

He has shown himself to be the more dominant one when he interacts with other dogs so if he goes to a home with another dog he will need a dog that is willing to let Achilles be top dog.  He might be too much for toddlers.  He has no idea how big he is so he is a lot like a bull in a china shop.  \n\nAchilles is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER.

He's very smart and learns quickly. Nigel is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative, neutered, microchipped with free lifetime membership, house trained and crate trained but he does hate that crate. His adoption fee is $200.

I have the most piercing blue eyes and a unique mask (markings on my face)! I came into the Rescue because my last owner wasn't very good to me and...I was pregnant. The Rescue helped my pups all find great homes and now it's my turn.\n\nThey say for a Husky I'm fairly calm. Don't know what they're talking about because boy do I like to get a few zoomies on in my foster's fenced in yard. But maybe they're right because after that I just want to cuddle on the couch. And all this love....I never knew what it was like to have all this attention and love. They even let me lay in their lap here. It's awesome! I soak it all up and I want my forever home to do the same for me.\n\nIn fact I've gotten so used to all this lovin that sometimes I get upset when my foster family leaves the house. I just want to be with them so bad! I'm sure that will get better after my hormones settle after I'm spayed at the end of January, but I definitely want my forever family to be around lots - even after this thing they call COVID.\n\nI also like other dogs so if my forever home had another dog that would be okay too but it's not required. I really just want all my humans attention so any other dog would have to be willing to share. I am potty trained and don't mind the crate. I really love the teenaged human here but haven't been around small children. The Rescue says I need a fenced yard and while I haven't tried to escape or anything they'd like a home for me who has researched the breed. If you haven't, they'll definitely give you a Siberian Husky 101 crash course! I can be vocal at times so it's best if I don't go live in an apartment.\n\nSo I think that's all for now, but I'm so ready to start this next chapter in my life and can be adopted at the beginning of Feb. My baby making days are over and now it's all about ME! Please apply today to make me a part of your family! ~~~Love, Jill\n\nJill is being fostered in MD. Applied adopters must be willing to meet here in MD. Adoption area NJ to VA. ~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

I'm a good girl who hopes some kind and patient person will give me a home and love me forever, but right now I really wish I could just hand the mic to this nice gentleman here who takes care of me...\n\nNice Gentleman (*taking mic*): Thank you, Carleigh, for agreeing to talk to everyone. I know how nervous you are, but you did very well, and you're doing better every day. Folks, Carleigh can be afraid of lots of things-new people, loud noises, being left alone. She's a good dog who is still learning boundaries and rules. She would do best with an experienced adopter, a home without children, and someone dedicated to continuing to let her blossom and feel safe, so her true personality shines. In the right environment, she will grow into a happy companion. Look, she's calmed down now. Carleigh, would you like the mic back?\n\nCarleigh: Maybe not, but could you tell these people that I like going outside for fresh air, especially if I can go for a long walk or a car ride? And that I also like biscuits, and soft plush toys, and large dog beds? And blankets! Nothing's more pleasant than a nap under a blanket!\n\nNice Gentleman: Carleigh, you just told them. You're braver than you know!\n\nCarleigh: Really? Well, here's what I do know-nothing feels better than hanging out with a patient person I've learned to trust!\n\nIf you'd like to take me home, please fill out an adoption application at this website-http://www.animalalliesrescue.org/adoption-application-and choose me, CARLEIGH! My adoption fee is $300 and includes all of my routine vetting, rabies and distemper/parvo vaccinations, deworming, spay/neuter surgery, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention, microchip, boarding and transportation costs if applicable, and a free* trial offer for 30 days of 24PetWatch pet insurance!\n\n*Dependent on meeting eligibility requirements: Dogs 8 weeks to 10 years of age and cats 8 weeks to 12 years of age. This offer is not currently available to residents of CA, PA or RI.",

            "description": "Nala is a 4 year old husky mix who is as sweet as a cinnamon roll. She loves puzzle toys and snoozing on a good couch. She also loves sniffing and exploring. She is a very food-driven, intelligent and trainable girl. She learned \"Sit\", \"Stay\" and \"Come\" in just a week! She would make a great family pet for a family with a fenced in yard. She is eager to please and wants to make friends with every human she meets. She does not jump up when greeting you, but puts her ears back and wags her tail as if to say \"hello there, are you my new friend?\" \n\nNala is potty trained, has no food aggression, and does great with kids. She has lived her whole life surrounded by babies and young children. She seems interested in cats, but gives them a wide berth when in the same room if she can tell they don't want to be friends.\n\nShe is a definite couch potato who loves to nap on the couch. She also enjoys having access to a yard where she can run around and sniff everything a few times throughout the day. She really lights up when given the chance to explore a yard! For this reason, Nala will need to be adopted by an owner who has a fenced in yard attached to their property.\n\nNala's favorite things are chicken, peanut butter, and the chance to go outside and sniff things. She is not a fan of car rides or being left alone--she whines and gets anxious. She would do best in a home where someone is home all the time.\n\nNala has been tested for dog aggression and is NOT aggressive. However, she is what is called \"leash reactive\", which means she barks and lunges if she is on a leash or behind a fence and she sees another dog. When she is in a play group with other dogs in a yard, she is not aggressive, although she can bark a bit. (That's the husky in her.) Nala needs a home with a yard so she can get exercise WITHOUT encountering dogs while on walks. She will need an owner with patience who can slowly introduce and desensitize her to seeing other dogs when she is on a leash.",

Once your application is approved, you will be able to call to schedule an appointment. If you have any questions, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand that we cannot hold any pets. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs.

She had taken both dogs in from neighbors who were mistreating them and gave them so much love over the last year that both resilient dogs are very well adjusted, obedient and happy! Both dogs are excellent with people, children and other dogs. \n\nBENTLEY, an American Bully mix, came to us with two large pendulous tumors growing from her rear. She underrated surgery to remove them on 12/30 and is doing great now! Biopsy results revealed:\n\nOf the two pendulous masses, while both were subcutaneous mast cell tumors (i.e., under the skin and not OF the skin) with a low mitotic count, meaning they are also less aggressive/less active, the margins on the right sided mass were clear and complete, but the left sided mass had a deep margin that was incomplete. This means that cancer cells were at the edge of what was removed. Because this area is too close to the vulva to cut deeper, we are submitting additional testing on that tumor to understand the likelihood of recurrence, though there is no evidence of spread. As this tumor is likley lower risk, BENTLEY\u2019s adopters will simply need to monitor the area for any regrowth/recurrence (about 15% risk.) In short, given the size and location of the masses, this is overall good news so BENTLEY and HONDO are ready to GO HOME!\n \nTo apply to adopt this bonded pair (we will not consider separate adoptions) within a 5-6 hour drive of NYC or their Western MA foster home, head to www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt or email elli@mrbonesandco.org. \n\nSpecial thanks to our surgeon, Dr. Daniel Spector, DVM DACVS-SA and the SS 2 team at @amcny for tackling BENTLEY'S difficultly positioned tumors and ensuring the surgical site was reconstructed to maintain full function, and to her foster mama, Janet and @sylvesterishelpful for making sure her aftercare was expertly attended to.\n\nRescue is the New Black.\u00ae?\n\n#AdoptBentleyandHondoMBC #RescueistheNewBlack #AmericanBully #Pitbull #Pomeranian",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Luna is a 1 -2 year old poodle / terrier mix. (We make no assumptions or guarantees that she is a hypoallergenic dog as we are not sure of her mix) She came into rescue with 3 fuzzy puppies who she took amazing care of! Luna was successfully treated for heartworm and will need to remain on preventive for the rest of her life. It is relatively inexpensive, depending on the brand you choose.\n\nHer foster family describes her as an old soul. She is the type of dog who just lays back and observes everything around her. She does have playful spurts but for the most part she just lays on the back of the couch and watches the world go by!\n\nLuna is a good girl. She has had a few accidents in her foster home (mostly when it rains) but for the most part will go outside to do her business. She is a people lover for sure. She does live with other dogs and tolerates them but we don't feel she would want to live in a permanent home with a high energy playful dog - that's just not what she likes and has no problem saying so. A calm dog like herself would be fine.\n\nLuna has a fenced in yard in her foster home and we found out pretty quickly that she was an escape artist. So if you have a fence it will have to be in good condition with NO way for her to get out. Chicken wire buried at the bottom for example (chain link) with no gaps anywhere. Wood panels at the bottom (wood fenced) also with no gaps or she will find them. She is also a door dasher so once she knows how you come and go she will be quick to try join you! This is probably how she ended up pregnant and in rescue as she is great at her craft LOL.\n\nWe think Luna would do fine with kids who are respectful of her. She has not been cat tested but we can't imagine her having any issues with anyone. She is working on leash training and has done very well but she will need more work on this in her forever home.\n\nLuna is spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and treated for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $450",

            "description": "Bentley, age 5, and Hondo, age 2, are a bonded pair whose NC owner sadly had to relinquish them to our organization due to a a health crisis. She had taken both dogs in from neighbors who were mistreating them and gave them so much love over the last year that both resilient dogs are very well adjusted, obedient and happy! Both dogs are excellent with people, children and other dogs. \n\nBENTLEY, an American Bully mix, came to us with two large pendulous tumors growing from her rear. She underrated surgery to remove them on 12/30 and is doing great now! Biopsy results revealed:\n\nOf the two pendulous masses, while both were subcutaneous mast cell tumors (i.e., under the skin and not OF the skin) with a low mitotic count, meaning they are also less aggressive/less active, the margins on the right sided mass were clear and complete, but the left sided mass had a deep margin that was incomplete. This means that cancer cells were at the edge of what was removed. Because this area is too close to the vulva to cut deeper, we are submitting additional testing on that tumor to understand the likelihood of recurrence, though there is no evidence of spread. As this tumor is likley lower risk, BENTLEY\u2019s adopters will simply need to monitor the area for any regrowth/recurrence (about 15% risk.) In short, given the size and location of the masses, this is overall good news so BENTLEY and HONDO are ready to GO HOME!\n \nTo apply to adopt this bonded pair (we will not consider separate adoptions) within a 5-6 hour drive of NYC or their Western MA foster home, head to www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt or email elli@mrbonesandco.org. \n\nSpecial thanks to our surgeon, Dr. Daniel Spector, DVM DACVS-SA and the SS 2 team at @amcny for tackling BENTLEY'S difficultly positioned tumors and ensuring the surgical site was reconstructed to maintain full function, and to her foster mama, Janet and @sylvesterishelpful for making sure her aftercare was expertly attended to.\n\nRescue is the New Black.\u00ae?\n\n#AdoptBentleyandHondoMBC #RescueistheNewBlack #AmericanBully #Pitbull #Pomeranian",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Two year old Zebu doesn't want to go to another home but his mom fears for his safety if she doesn't rehome him, due to conflicts with another dog in the household. If you have multiple dogs in your household or multiple pets of any kind, it's possible they won't always get along. In this case it has become dangerous for Zebu. He was a rescue a year ago who was so shy he had to be picked up and carried out to the car when he was adopted. He has since made huge progress with his mom's assistance. He is very playful, and knows sit, shake, laydown, and give me kisses. He's also a snuggly dog!\n\nHere is the ideal \"must have\" home for him, because when he does go to new places he can be very nervous: a fenced yard, another nice dog for companionship (he has some anxiety when left at home alone), and a fairly quiet home with little change or coming and going. Zebu appears to be a cattle dog or a hound mix, with a soft silky coat. He is two years old, about 45 pounds, and has adapted well to this home. However an adopter needs to know that he cannot make an instant transition as easily as other dogs might. If you're interested in adopting, please start with an application found here: friendsofcampbellcounty.org, under the animals heading.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This pet has been posted by Friends of Campbell County Animal Control, Rustburg, VA. For questions about the pet, please email us at FOACinfo@gmail.com. All adoptions begin with an application, found under the \"Animals\" tab on our website, friendsofcampbellcounty.org. *We will not consider invisible fencing.",

About 50 lbs., this mixed breed needs some help understanding that each meal is NOT his last ... he just wants to know that loving and kibble will be his furever more. Cheezer would do best in a home with children over 12 years old and where he is the only K9 companion. Call us to make an appointment to meet this special boy. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received. All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

Nothing a little time in foster care, some medication and good food can't fix. \n\nGrace is settling into foster care. She is playful and spunky, despite her hair loss. She's super affectionate and wants to be where the people are. She's a chill girl when her humans are home and loves to curl up and rest or sleep on her dog bed. She's good with other dogs.\n\nShe'll need a bit more time in foster care for her fur to fill back in but once it does she'll be adoption ready and waiting to find her perfect forever home.

            "description": "When picked up, Cal was a 4-year-old stray in desperate need of a warm bath. Once he was lathered up and toweled off, this mixed breed impressed us with his good looks AND good nature. He's a sweet and friendly fella who thinks he's a lap dog and who are we to disagree? This special guy we believe would do well in any home. Cal has tested positive for heartworm, but FAMD does cover the cost of treatment. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received. All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

Katie was a great mom but they are all weaned and being prepared to go to loving families. Now it's Katie's turn for some pampering. She likes people and has a sweet nature and a wagging tail. Katie gets very excited when greeting people she knows, but can be nervous at first with those she doesn't know. She would do best with older teenagers and the entire family should be here to meet her. She'd prefer to be the only pet--she deserves some spoiling. Kate will need patient and understanding adopters who know that dogs like her benefit from time to settle in, an established routine, and then basic obedience with confidence=building exercises. Katie is worth the effort!",

            "description": "Zeus is a sweet German Shepherd puppy, born 7/9/2020. Zeus is social boy who loves all people, kids and adults, and currently lives in a home with teenagers and a younger child. He is a big, active pup so his foster recommends caution with any children under 6 years old. Zeus is excited to share outdoor adventures with you so a large yard with a 6-feet fence would be the perfect situation for Zeus to get the body and brain exercises that he needs! At this time, Zeus is cautious about other dogs, but would enjoy having another dog friend to play with at home; he's ready to make friends and doesn't mind sharing his food and toys. He has not been tested with cats. Zeus is a sweet, very smart boy and would love to have an owner who is home most of the day. In his foster home, Zeus is learning how to enjoy his kennel and how to take his dirty business outside -- every time! Zeus is still settling in with his foster family and more information will be available in the coming weeks.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Zeus is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

A few of Harry's favorite things: attention, naps on a big cushy dog bed (or your couch if you'll let him), having his fluffy fur coat petted, long walks in the cool morning weather. He's also good for a jog if you are. And he loves playing fetch with tennis balls! Harry puts his nose under your arm or flips your hand onto his head when he wants attention, and he never barks. He is curious about new people and needs everyone to go slow with him. He takes a little time and lots of treats to warm up to new people, but once you are in, he's all about love. He's a house-trained boy who is considerate and only climbs on furniture when invited (or when you aren't home). Harry is a medium energy dog that would do best as the only dog in your home. Come meet Harry today!",

He loves walks so much that when he sees you getting his leash out, he'll do a dance, spinning in circles and jiggling his butt in delight. Then at home on the couch, he's a big face licker and super cuddler. And if you stop petting and scratching him, he'll nudge you with his paw. This quirky, playful boy also loves playing catch and stalking those silly squirrels for hours. And he may steal your socks and take them in the yard to hide them. He freaked out in the recent snow, zooming all over the yard. But if you need to be on your Zoom meetings, he's happy to just go off and snooze. He's also wonderful with his foster's kids, doing no mouthing, jumping or rough play. A smart boy, he's also completely house-trained and does well when home alone, roaming freely. This gentle, loving boy will love a home with faces to lick and kids of all ages to play with. Come show him a leash and he'll follow you home!",

Due to his size, Ox is not a good fit with kids.  He wouldn't hurt a fly, but he doesn't know his own strength when he's having fun playing with his human friends at VIDA Rescue.  He gets along great with other dogs, and loves to take walks.  He'd be a great fit in an active household.  He's ready for his forever home!\n\n**** If you see a pet posted from us, they are AVAILABLE (we update constantly). Please apply right away as opposed to inquiring about if they are available.

            "description": "THEY BROKE THE MOLD WITH THIS SILLY GIRL\n\nCleo is LOADED with hutzpah and she LOVES to show it.\n\nNeed some levity and entertainment added to your home?  Cleo has the personality and wow factor to liven up any home situation.  She's full of life, loaded with drama, as only Frenchie's are and really makes it hard to have a bad day, if she had any say in there matter.\n\nCleo is about 8 years old and a very healthy, solid, 15 lbs.  Don't worry about that eye.  That is a very old injury that was never treated and our vets will be removing what's left of the eye and closing it up to prevent further infection or injury.  So to add to her already overflowing eccentricity, she will also be one eyed and all the more colorful.\n\nCleo is probably not a dog for the first time dog owner.  She has a big, strong personality that needs an equally strong-willed person to guide her and help her use her powers for good.  She's smart, silly, intense, alert, playful, loving, devoted, curious, outgoing and ready for adventure but she has a shy, skeptical side when meeting new people and appreciates respectful introductions, sprinkled with a delicious treat or two.  She loves toys, treats, mealtime, car rides, walks and is not a particularly vocal dog, though she has an entire repertoire of snorts, snuffles, squeals and squawks that are hilarious... And she snores\n\nShe's pretty much housebroken but will test your meddle in making sure she stays on task, especially in inclement weather.  She also crates very nicely, but needs to be reminded that whining will get her nowhere.  She had a horrible habit of jumping hard, on people, bouncing off them like springboards.  She's learned that is bad manners too but will test your convictions on that from time to time, just to make sure it's still a no-no..\n\nCleo loves to snuggle during downtime and is very affectionate and loving.  She lives with a variety of dogs and does well with them all and has a delicate detente with the dog savvy cat, that might falter with a less confident kitty.  Kids are not her favorite but those over 12 who can mean no, when they say no, would be fine.\n\nSo if you think you have the sense of humor that would make this girl a welcome addition to your home, please go to our website at www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and tell us all about you and why you think this girl is perfect for you.\n\nCleo is spayed, microchipped, up to date on five way and rabies vaccinations, is worm and flea free and will be ready to go after her eye surgery on February 5th..\n\nHer adoption fee is $275\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n*Inquiries submitted through Petfinder, are not the same as applications \n  submitted through our webpage.  \n*Yes we do out of state adoptions.\n*No, we do not transport. You must be willing to come and meet the dog and \n  take it home with you.\n*Yes we do Canadian adoptions.\n*If the dog is on Petfinder, it is still available.\n*You must be 18 years of age to adopt\n*If you submit questions about an adoptable dog, covered in the Petfinder bio, \n we will not respond.\n*We do not pick the first good application.  We pick the most suitable \n  application for the dog, out of all submitted.\n*All correspondence is handled via email as time allows.  \n* If you are not chosen, you will not be notified\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of our adoption process, go to www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and read \"The Adoption Process\" link",

Eva came into rescue when her family found that they were too busy to give her the attention she deserves.  Eva loves snuggles but also likes her \u201cme\u201d time so she does very well in a crate, and she hasn\u2019t had any accidents in the house since she has come into rescue.  Eva has had little humans in her life so she is good with children that will respect her space, because she can growl at you when she is enjoying her \u201cme\u201d time with her toy or bone, but she has never tried to nip at anyone in her foster family when they come to interrupt her chew time.  So we think she would be best with older children that understand this.  Eva will see the vet this week to get her vaccinations up to date and make sure she doesn\u2019t have heart worms, and will need a dental also, but then she will be ready to meet her future family.  If you think you would like to give this Queen the retirement home she deserves fill out an application because she would love to meet you!\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

I'm still a pup at only 3 years old and I am available for adoption at @agouraanimalslaco! \n.\nI arrived at the shelter as a stray and It's pretty obvious I've had a litter or two and yet, noone came to get me ??. Did you know, on average, only 10% of animals that enter the shelter system are spayed or nuetered?! Many are dumped once they can no longer breed?.\n.\nI was named Angel, well, because I am a sweet angel girl. HHA funded pathology for a mass between my toes, results are still pending but I am available for meet & greets! I love being with humans, lots of pets and delicious treats ?.  I have so much love to give & I love all the attention, so I prefer to be the one & only fur face in the home. \n.\nEmail agoura@animalcare.lacounty.gov to meet me! Ask for Angel ??. \n.\nHealthcareforhomelessanimals.org/donate\nVenmo: Healthcareforhomelessanimals",

But he's eager to please and eager to learn. He is responsive to his name and is great with his brother and my pittie. He eats slowly, so will sometimes get annoyed with Butter while they're eating, but he's becoming less guarded. \n\nHe's learning how to sit and lay down, but is a little overexcited sometimes and will forget what he's doing- but he loves his snacks, so he gets back on track quickly. He goes up and down stairs with ease and plays at full speed outside. While he loves his attention, he likes to be independent and explore in the bushes and investigate whatever he hears outside. He's timid at first, but warms up to you fairly quickly, then good luck getting alone time. He's definitely a Velcro pup and needs to always be at the center of attention. He listens well when called to come back inside after going to the bathroom. He's great with going to do his business outside and not in the house. We're working on crate training for two hours at a time and they do not whine or cry.\n\nPlease apply at thepitbullpen.org\nLocation: fostered in Portland, Oregon\nAdoption fee: $450",

He's not possessive and doesn't guard them at all; he just wants to surround himself. \n\nHe does well with his brother and his foster brother, a pittie. He will play and play once he's comfortable. He's not very vocal, though he'll whine to let you know it's time to go outside. As a fast learner, he picked up potty training and is getting the hang of sit and fetch. He's great in his crate and is perfectly content so long as he has a toy, and a bed (or a lap).

He is black and white with blue eyes. One of his eyes has an old, healed, coronial ulcer, but he still sees very well. He is great with handling and playing with large dogs. He was non reactive to cats in encounter tests, primarily due to his curiosity about everything else in his environment. He would do well in a Siberian or large dog savvy home with excellent fencing and time to help him direct his puppy energy. He is affectionate, gentle mouth, knows sit and shake but needs leash training. His forever him must be experienced. He is becoming more comfortable in crate.

            "description": "Hi I'm Alfred, but my foster mom calls me Freddy. I am a handsome young pup and sweet as can be. My foster mom thinks I am going to be a big boy when I grow up. I am crate trained, house trained and get along well with my foster dog sister, although she is older and sometimes gets grumpy with my lack of personal boundaries. Because I am a puppy I am still learning proper manners like not jumping, being mouthy, and chewing on things, but am eager to please and already doing better. I I love to play with my toys and chew on bones, but my favorite thing is being with my human and cuddling. My foster mom thinks I would do best in a home that can give me lots of attention and patience since I am still learning the rules. I love kids but would do best in a home that has older kids because I like to knock tiny humans down. I would also love to have a furry dog brother or sister to play with so I don\u2019t get bored. I can\u2019t wait to find my forever home.\n\nEmail info@habitat4paws.org for an application.\n\n**Because we require home visits, we only adopt locally to the Dallas/Fort Worth area. For more on adoption policies, please see the Adopt page of our website, www.habitat4paws.org.",

            "description": "**If you are interested in adopting one of the puppies, please download and fill out an application from our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com. The puppies' adoption fee is $450, and they will come to their adopters spayed/neutered, microchipped, with age appropriate vaccinations, and several dewormings.** \n\nJuniper is an active, playful, smart and feisty little girl! She'll do well with an adopter who will keep up with her energy level and keep her busy. She's a bit hesitant of adult dogs right now so should have an adopter who either has another adult dog in the home, or someone who will be able to set up lots of playdates with other known dogs to make sure she grows up to be well socialized. Juniper loves all people and kids and after she's worn out from playing, loves snuggling and getting belly rubs.\n\nWe are now accepting applications for our 20 puppies, the cookie and spice litters!\n\nSee more photos of all of the puppies on their Facebook album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=forgottendogsrescue&set=a.3921486117870156\n\nIn November, we were contacted by our partners at Yakima Valley Pet Rescue (YVPR) to help with these litters of puppies. YVPR had taken in two pregnant moms (who were both in the same household) and were able to get them into one of their foster homes where the puppies were then born.  Unfortunately, the owners of the mom dogs only agreed to let YVPR (and, subsequently, us) take the puppies under the condition that the moms get returned to them but YVPR is going to ensure the moms spayed so they don\u2019t have to go through this again. We would love to take the mom dogs as well but, this is out of our control and we are happy to, at least, help their puppies. \n\nAs with most of our pups, we aren\u2019t sure of their mixes but the moms appear to be part Pit Bull type dogs.  They are not related but, we think the puppies may all have had the same dad as there was a Pit Bull roaming around the area and the puppies were born within a day of each other.  Of course, this is all conjecture.  \n\nThe Cookie litter (9 puppies) were born on 10/30 and the Spice Litter (11 puppies) were born on 10/31. \n\nCookie Litter:\nChocolate Chip - Male\nMacaroon - Male\nSamoa - Male\nBiscotti - Male\nGingersnap - Female\nNo-Bake - Male\nRum Ball - Male\nMacadamia - Male\nMolasses - Female\n\nSpice Litter:\nGinger - Female\nNutmeg - Female\nPepper - Male\nCocoa - Female\nCinnamon - Female\nCaper - Male\nPoppy - Female\nClove - Female\nDill - Male\nChipotle - Male\nJuniper - Female\n\nThe pups have all been in loving foster homes in groups of 2 and 3 for the last month, and have been socialized, exposed to lots of new things, and have started working on house and crate training.  Several have been with kids or kitties or adult dogs or all of these or some of these. We will be working closely with each approved applicant to determine the best fit for the adoptive puppy and the family based on what we know about their personalities and temperaments. \n\n\nPlease note that due to a large influx of applications we get for puppies, it can take several weeks for us to finish reviewing and processing them to find the best match for each individual puppy. Once adoption applications are approved, meetings will be set up with approved applicants, and, as mentioned, more information on individual puppies\u2019 temperaments will be given and we will be working with each applicant to determine the best fit for the puppy and their prospective family.  \n",

            "description": "**If you are interested in adopting one of the puppies, please download and fill out an application from our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com. The puppies' adoption fee is $450, and they will come to their adopters spayed/neutered, microchipped, with age appropriate vaccinations, and several dewormings.** \n\nWe are now accepting applications for our 20 puppies, the cookie and spice litters!\n\nSee more photos of all of the puppies on their Facebook album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=forgottendogsrescue&set=a.3921486117870156\n\nIn November, we were contacted by our partners at Yakima Valley Pet Rescue (YVPR) to help with these litters of puppies. YVPR had taken in two pregnant moms (who were both in the same household) and were able to get them into one of their foster homes where the puppies were then born.  Unfortunately, the owners of the mom dogs only agreed to let YVPR (and, subsequently, us) take the puppies under the condition that the moms get returned to them but YVPR is going to ensure the moms spayed so they don\u2019t have to go through this again. We would love to take the mom dogs as well but, this is out of our control and we are happy to, at least, help their puppies. \n\nAs with most of our pups, we aren\u2019t sure of their mixes but the moms appear to be part Pit Bull type dogs.  They are not related but, we think the puppies may all have had the same dad as there was a Pit Bull roaming around the area and the puppies were born within a day of each other.  Of course, this is all conjecture.  \n\nThe Cookie litter (9 puppies) were born on 10/30 and the Spice Litter (11 puppies) were born on 10/31. \n\nCookie Litter:\nChocolate Chip - Male\nMacaroon - Male\nSamoa - Male\nBiscotti - Male\nGingersnap - Female\nNo-Bake - Male\nRum Ball - Male\nMacadamia - Male\nMolasses - Female\n\nSpice Litter:\nGinger - Female\nNutmeg - Female\nPepper - Male\nCocoa - Female\nCinnamon - Female\nCaper - Male\nPoppy - Female\nClove - Female\nDill - Male\nChipotle - Male\nJuniper - Female\n\nThe pups have all been in loving foster homes in groups of 2 and 3 for the last month, and have been socialized, exposed to lots of new things, and have started working on house and crate training.  Several have been with kids or kitties or adult dogs or all of these or some of these. We will be working closely with each approved applicant to determine the best fit for the adoptive puppy and the family based on what we know about their personalities and temperaments. \n\n\nPlease note that due to a large influx of applications we get for puppies, it can take several weeks for us to finish reviewing and processing them to find the best match for each individual puppy. Once adoption applications are approved, meetings will be set up with approved applicants, and, as mentioned, more information on individual puppies\u2019 temperaments will be given and we will be working with each applicant to determine the best fit for the puppy and their prospective family.  \n\n",

Even a dog door is no hurdle for her. She loves to play with other dogs and is great with children.\n\nOur Mona Lisa is still finding her feet in her new surroundings and is learning that the world is not a bad place after all.\n\nMona is a dog's dog but blossoms into a people dog if given time and space. She is initially shy with new people until she figures out no one is out to hurt her. If you already have a playful pup to show her the ropes and play with her she will come around in no time. A secure fenced in yard is essential to keep this girl happy and safe.\n\nShe is gaining confidence and trust in humans more and more each day but will require a family who can dedicate the time she needs to overcome her past and focus on her happy furever future.\n\nAll of our animals are fully vetted which includes spay/neuter, up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested and treated if necessary, up to date on flea/tick/heartworm prevention and microchipped) prior to adoption.\n\nTo start the adoption process please copy the below link in your browser and complete the application.  NOTE:  please read our requirements located above the application.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeotmh7qepR0mRvxSqy42yViQnllmR0-FKTFmUo2ANK4AXPaQ/viewform\n\nThank you for reading and THANK you for choosing to adopt!\n",

Before that he proved to be a great Daddy. Tim Tam is getting used to life in the big city of Los Angeles as he came from rural Central California and, based on what was done to his ears, has not had an easy life. Our busy streets are intimidating to him.  Some of our volunteers have spent time with him and he is gentle, sweet and loving, he just needs to know he is SAFE in order to relax. He will need some time to adjust to a new environment and city life. Tim Tam would do well in a home with a safe, private yard and can live with another dog who will help him continue his progress in building confidence. He is a handsome and very sweet boy.  \nIn the meantime, Tim Tam is looking for a foster home so if you\u2019re interested in fostering this beautiful boy, please complete our  application https://www.therealbark.org/adoption-app\n",

This dog is not ready for adoption yet but please follow us theREALbark on FaceBook and @therealbark on Instagram to see updates on her progress.\n\n\nLorna is a sweet, smart, quiet and very shy lady.  Once she knows she is safe, and with a proper introduction, she is good with other dogs. She is in a foster home with two other nice dogs and does well with them.  She is super shy with people but learning how to trust them through her foster brothers.  She would do best in a home with a safe yard as she needs some lady-like privacy for her bathroom breaks. A calm household is a must and another dog who is nice tempered would be great, and children who are older than 16 would be fine. Lorna is still scared of loud noises, that is a work in progress both in the home and outside. She LOVES her walks now with her foster brothers and we hope we will continue to love her walks in her new home with a strong foundation. She will need a home with an adopter who understands rescue dogs who may have been neglected and not had a great relationship with people. Someone who will have the patience to continue working with Lorna on her progress. She is crate trained for a couple of hours only.\n",

She is pretty laid back and chill, but when it comes to dinner time, she is a happy dancing fool for her food. \nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250.  covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

She loves a warm lap and even better a warm bed under the covers. \nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250. covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

At first we thought she had limited vision in one eye, but we got a second option at our vet and after a full eye exam, it's been discovered she has her sight in both eyes!! The vet guessed Marta is around 12 weeks old and most likely a pit mix of some sorts. She's a happy wiggly girl and can't wait to find a forever home! She would do best in an active home committed to puppy training.\n\nPit bull & strong breed adoption criteria\n- Must be over 25 years of age to adopt a Pit Bull, Pit Bull mix, or strong breed dog.\n- Written landlord permission or a pet policy allowing the specific breed is required for adoption approval.\n- A virtual home visit may be required.\n- Training or breed experience is required as part of the adoption.\n- Agree to not take the dog to dog parks or dog daycare.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting please fill out an application at our website www.gobeyondrescue.org/adopt. Our adoption fee is $350 and includes spay/neuter, microchipping and up to date vaccines. We Adopt in the SF Bay Area Only.",

            "description": "MEET IZI!\n\nThis tiny chocolate-colored boy is named Izi! Izi is an 11 year old Chihuahua who was surrendered to the shelter because his former family was moving and couldn't bring him along. Luckily, he found his way to City of Elderly Love and is now hoping to find the perfect retirement home!\u00a0\n\nIzi is relatively quiet, calm and loving. He loves to spend his time with his foster family and will follow you room to room to see what you're up to.\u00a0He'll occasionally get a spurt of energy and want to play but\u00a0his favorite place to be is cuddled up on the couch next to you. Though he's a little guy, he's not the stereotypical yappy small dog though he'll\u00a0bark at unexpected loud noises or knocks at the door like most dogs. He can be a bit nervous which is why he prefers to stay by your side. Izi loves to go for walks and because he's a little guy with a little bladder, he does need to go out several times a day. He's working on his crate training skills and will sometimes have an accident if left too long. Izi is currently living in foster care with other dogs and cats. He's comfortable sharing his space with them but would prefer a home with other low-key animals like himself. Though he hasn't met anyone he doesn't love, we think he'd be happiest in a home with older children due to his size and love of leisure.\n\nIzi has received a veterinary workup since coming to the shelter and has been diagnosed with a Grade IV (of VI) heart murmur. He is currently on three medications to help with the heart condition (pimobendan, furosemide, enalapril). He has a cardio workup scheduled in February which will be at the cost of the rescue. Due to his heart murmur, he cannot receive a dental cleaning until he has been cleared by the cardiologist, which will also be at the cost of the rescue.\n\nIzi is available for adoption through City of Elderly Love. He is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. He is also heartworm and lymes disease negative. Interested in adopting him? Visit www.cityofelderlylove.org to complete an online adoption questionnaire or email us at info@cityofelderlylove.org!",

            "description": "Meet Baxter. Baxter is a chihuahua mix. He weighs about 15 pounds. (I am surprised he isn't a little more from all the treats he receives. Everyone loves him at the shelter) Baxter has been at the shelter for about 6 months to 1 year. He has been at the shelter a while due to his trust issues. A little backstory on Baxter... He was rescued in a garage. We aren't sure if he was abused or just ignored his whole life. We can't change Baxter's past but we can change his future.  Baxter has came a long way with our volunteers!! We are so proud of this little guy. He does a happy puppy tail wag when we give him treats or talk to him in a baby voice. \n\n\"If Baxter could talk, I'd say he would have some tales to tell. You have to meet him, spend some time with him and let him give you the once over. He is a sweetie once you guys know each other\"\n\nBaxter is older and we hope that doesn't scare you away. Baxter would do best in a home with NO little kids and no super energetic pups. Quick movements can spook him and maybe cause a low growl. Baxter does do well with older and/or senior dogs. Looking to start a new series on Netflix? Baxter would love to join you on the couch!! \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Baxter please fill out an application here http://www.treasuredfriendsrescue.org/?page_id=1281\n\nIf you can't adopt please share Baxter's story. The more people know about him the higher chance he could find a forever home!",

            "description": "**If you are interested in adopting one of the puppies, please download and fill out an application from our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com. The puppies' adoption fee is $450, and they will come to their adopters spayed/neutered, microchipped, with age appropriate vaccinations, and several dewormings.** \n\nWe are now accepting applications for our 20 puppies, the cookie and spice litters!\n\nSee more photos of all of the puppies on their Facebook album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=forgottendogsrescue&set=a.3921486117870156\n\nIn November, we were contacted by our partners at Yakima Valley Pet Rescue (YVPR) to help with these litters of puppies. YVPR had taken in two pregnant moms (who were both in the same household) and were able to get them into one of their foster homes where the puppies were then born.  Unfortunately, the owners of the mom dogs only agreed to let YVPR (and, subsequently, us) take the puppies under the condition that the moms get returned to them but YVPR is going to ensure the moms spayed so they don\u2019t have to go through this again. We would love to take the mom dogs as well but, this is out of our control and we are happy to, at least, help their puppies. \n\nAs with most of our pups, we aren\u2019t sure of their mixes but the moms appear to be part Pit Bull type dogs.  They are not related but, we think the puppies may all have had the same dad as there was a Pit Bull roaming around the area and the puppies were born within a day of each other.  Of course, this is all conjecture.  \n\nThe Cookie litter (9 puppies) were born on 10/30 and the Spice Litter (11 puppies) were born on 10/31. \n\nCookie Litter:\nChocolate Chip - Male\nMacaroon - Male\nSamoa - Male\nBiscotti - Male\nGingersnap - Female\nNo-Bake - Male\nRum Ball - Male\nMacadamia - Male\nMolasses - Female\n\nSpice Litter:\nGinger - Female\nNutmeg - Female\nPepper - Male\nCocoa - Female\nCinnamon - Female\nCaper - Male\nPoppy - Female\nClove - Female\nDill - Male\nChipotle - Male\nJuniper - Female\n\nThe pups have all been in loving foster homes in groups of 2 and 3 for the last month, and have been socialized, exposed to lots of new things, and have started working on house and crate training.  Several have been with kids or kitties or adult dogs or all of these or some of these. We will be working closely with each approved applicant to determine the best fit for the adoptive puppy and the family based on what we know about their personalities and temperaments. \n\n\nPlease note that due to a large influx of applications we get for puppies, it can take several weeks for us to finish reviewing and processing them to find the best match for each individual puppy. Once adoption applications are approved, meetings will be set up with approved applicants, and, as mentioned, more information on individual puppies\u2019 temperaments will be given and we will be working with each applicant to determine the best fit for the puppy and their prospective family.  \n\n",

            "description": "NAME: SARAH JESSICA PARKER\n\nAGE/GENDER: 2 year old female\n\nBREED: Thai street dog\n\nTEMPERAMENT: Loving, low-maintenance\n\nWEIGHT: About 30 lbs\n\nHOUSE TRAINING: Good\n\nCRATE TRAINING: Good\n\nOTHER DOGS: Sarah Jessica Parker will do best as the only dog in the home.\n\nCATS: TBD\n\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $450\n\nHEALTH: Sarah Jessica Parker had a severe wound on her foot (now healed) and had a previous hip surgery. She has recovered well and is able to go on leisurely walks.\n\nYour adoption donation goes toward offsetting the cost of this vet care as well as other incidental costs of care.\n\nHISTORY: Sarah Jessica Parker came to us from our friends, Soi Dog Foundation. She was brought to the shelter as a puppy with a severe foot wound. Sadly, she was in the shelter for 2 years.\n\nMotley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find her a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do!\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: Sarah Jessica Parker is a very sweet girl. She loves to go for walks but, due to her previous hip surgery, she prefers walks around the neighborhood over hikes or long treks. She is nervous around loud noises, young children, and lots of commotion. She is still growing her confidence and can be shy, but is a total love.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and Martingale collar (or a harness, if necessary), depending on each dog's particular needs. Each dog also receives a \"Tour Gear Bag\" full of brochures, coupons, and supplies for your new pup!\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO:\n\nWelcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue! We are a rock and roll themed, volunteer-run, foster based, 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Redmond, WA.\n\nMotley Zoo is a FOSTER BASED organization, which means our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes (or partnering pet stores) where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. We do not have animals available for casual viewing and same day adoption. Due to the volunteer run structure and decentralized/ virtual nature of a foster based group, an approved application is required to make an adoption appointment for any of our animals.\n\nIf you are interested in one of our Adoptable Roadies, please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application (the auto-responder also has a link to our application). We will work toward getting you approved as an adopter so that we can set a time for you to meet your new best friend!\n\nMotley Zoo also runs \"Rock Star Treatment Dog Daycare\" in Redmond, WA where proceeds from this service, help support our rescue's vet budget- however, this is NOT a shelter. For more information about daycare or training, check out www.rockstartreatment.org.\n\nPlease visit our website www.motleyzoo.org for more information!\n\nThanks for considering adoption- we look forward to helping you find your best match in a furry friend.\n\nRock on-\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

I am a large sized breed dog. Forest would love to go for long hikes and beach trips! Forest has been up for adoption for about a year so he would love to find his forever home soon! If you have other dogs we can schedule a meet and greet to see if they get along, It can take a few meet and greet for them to get along. \nForest came in as a stray and no one came to claim him. He does need a 6ft fence because he is good at escaping. He needs someone who is patient and willing to train him. He has so much love to share. \n\n**We will be having our first adoption event at Griffith Animal Control this Saturday 1/30 from 11am-2pm!!! This event is appointment only so please use the link below to sign up\nhttps://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0c4dacaa2dabfec25-dogadoption\nWe are so excited to see you there!!! This event is for our shelter dogs and cats!\nWe would greatly appreciate if you could please fill out an application prior to you coming.

A household with small dogs is fine. No kids to respect Bear\u2019s preference to have space. Bear\u2019s future home requires a fully fenced yard. He is a sweet senior boy who would love to have a home of his own.\n\nHe is located in Corning, CA. Bear is neutered and up to date on vaccines.

            "description": "~~~~~\nWe are SO SORRY TO ADVISE YOU ... We are NO LONGER ADOPTING TO MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS DUE TO STRICTER AND UNATTAINABLE REGULATIONS !!\n\nLiam is a 1 year old Blue heeler. He was snagged off of a very busy  6 lane highway in Louisiana  - we can only imagine that he got there due to the horrible intentions of someone.....  \nHe was brought to the vet and cleaned all of the wounds from running (in broken glass ; presumably)  brought to safety and we waited for almost a MONTH to re-unite him with his owners... and we waited.... Surely SOMEONE is missing this great guy- He is great with kids.... with dogs... and even (surprisingly) the resident cat!    He is NOT the typical Cattle dog- perhaps that is why someone dumped him.  He is well mannered and HOUSE TRAINED and is not UBER hyper as many ACD's / Heelers  are .. what a find! A diamond in the rough!  (RUFF) \n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, January 23rd 2021 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

Needs a firm hand and lots of understanding of his situation. He will bond tightly to one person which would be the ideal situation but can work with a family if time is given to get used to them.

            "description": "ADOPT ME ONLINE: https://ophrescue.org/dogs/10350\n\nHi! My name is Grand Teton and I'm part of the National Parks transport that came to OPH 1-8-21! I'm guessed to be a terrier mix and I weigh about 55lbs. I'm a sweet girl and I am about 4 years old. Being a former mother, I am gentle, loving, and protective. I love going on long walks, meeting new people and dogs (though a bit shy at first), and absolutely LOVE to cuddle. I'm athletic and love hanging out. \n\nGrand Teton is a medical miracle. Her body has recovered from severe injuries in amazing ways naturally, which can be viewed as a testament to her physical strength and health as well as overall resilient nature of her character. She does cope with being crated, but it is not her favorite. She is playful, but doesn't play with toys. She is friendly with other humans as well as other pets so long as they're not aggressive. She is great walking companion - no pulls. Generally, she is the perfect balance of social and submissive. She is curious, but listens very well. She is also very intelligent and can be trained easily. She is mostly praise-driven, but a combination of praise and treat works best. She prefers to go to the bathroom off the leash so a fenced in yard would be ideal. \n\nI've made my way north in search of my new family. Is that with you? If so apply today! I won't be available for long! \n\nThis dog tested positive for heartworm disease before arriving to the rescue. Heartworm disease is transmitted to a dog through a bite from an infected mosquito producing a positive test in six months. OPH will treat the dog and provide two weeks of recovery time prior to adoption. Potential adopters will receive detailed information on the disease and their role in completing the recovery process from OPHs heartworm coordinator. With monthly preventatives, the disease is completely preventable. \nRead more about heartworm disease here here\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Annie is 7 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. Annie is good with people and other dogs, but cats are not her friends! It's hard to believe the level of cruelty that exists in the world, but it smacked us in the face when we saw the condition this poor pup was in when she was surrendered to a kill shelter by her owner, the person Annie trusted to love and take care of her. Annie was just skin and bones, weak and sick at less than half the weight she should be. She did not get into that condition overnight. Annie has been treated by our veterinary partner and she is on the road to recovery. Annie is a spunky pup who can't wait to explore all the world has to offer her--and that's much more than she has ever had. If you can give Annie a happy life that far exceeds the quality of life being led by her disgusting abuser, please apply online to adopt Annie (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "~~~~~\n\nJumbo is a 5 year old Doberman German Shepherd mix. He weighs 78 pounds. He is an amazing guy and we think that  he'd be a great service dog/ ESA ....   We think that he'd be best without any other dogs in the home as he will stand up and grumble if another challenges him. \nTraining WILL help.... he just needs to learn the option of walking away. ANY good trainer can help with this! \n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, January 23rd 2021 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

I have had a checkered past so human contact is not familiar to me. I am a bit of a flight risk because I am used to fending for myself so an ideal home would be one with a fenced in yard. I get along great with my foster families personal dog and I don't seem to mind their cat. I am house trained and kennel trained, in fact often my kennel is my safe place. I am curious and quick and need someone who has patience and kindness to share. I would do best in a calm house with another dog to help show me the ropes. If this sounds like you then fill out an application for me just remember meet and greets are not my specialty because I am nervous. I promise though in time I will show you how perfect of a dog I am.",

            "description": "During the state mandated shelter-in-place order BACS has transitioned to virtual, socially-distanced adoptions.\nIf you have an interest in a particular BACS animal, please email KSwanson@cityofberkeley.info. The first step will be to set up a virtual meeting with their current foster family via phone, zoom, or facetime, to provide you with more detailed information about the animal. Following that, if you feel like it could be a good adoption fit, shelter staff will help coordinate a socially-distanced meeting in person so that you can meet your potential family member up-close and personal. Thank you for your patience during this time. We really appreciate your support!\n\nCarden is a sweet, lovable middle-aged dog. He is kind of like a big teddy bear. He just wants to snuggle, go on walks, and play with his toys all day. He is very friendly when meeting new people and other dogs, and has done great living alongside our other Shepherd. He can be skittish sometimes because he is inexperienced with the world, but we don't consider him a fundamentally \"anxious\" dog. He crates well overnight and when needed during the day, and has done a great job learning leash manners and basic commands. Now all he needs is a loving forever home!\n",

She still has some puppy energy as she is still young being around 1.5-2 years old. We are working on manners and obedience (so far we know sit really well and working on laying down and waiting). She is submissive to dogs. She is 55 pounds. She would love a home that has a playful doggy sibling, a large yard for her to run in or an active family that goes on walks/hikes on a regular basis. She truly is a very good girl!! She does have a prey drive, so we do recommend a home without cats. \n\nIf interested in Brandy please send in an adoption application as the first step! www.soardogs.org\n\nAdoption donation required. This covers altering, DAP series vaccinations to date of adoption, Bordetella Vaccination, Rabies vaccination if over four months, Microchip, Deworming, heartworm test (if over 8 months), monthly flea/heartworm prevention to date, grooming, full veterinary examination, and temperament evaluation. Please e-mail us for more information or go to our website https://soardogs.org/adoption-application for an application. Thank you very much!\u00a0\n\n\nAll SOAR dogs go through a ten-day quarantine period to ensure they are healthy, before being adopted. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis, but screen applicants in order to find the best fit for our adoptable dogs.",

The puppies' adoption fee is $450, and they will come to their adopters spayed/neutered, microchipped, with age appropriate vaccinations, and several dewormings.** \n\nBiscotti is very outgoing, confident, active and playful (he's a very rough and tumble physical player). He would do best in a home with an adult dog to help guide him, and with an adopter who will keep up with training to ensure Biscotti grows up to be the best dog possible.\n\nWe are now accepting applications for our 20 puppies, the cookie and spice litters!\n\nSee more photos of all of the puppies on their Facebook album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=forgottendogsrescue&set=a.3921486117870156\n\nIn November, we were contacted by our partners at Yakima Valley Pet Rescue (YVPR) to help with these litters of puppies. YVPR had taken in two pregnant moms (who were both in the same household) and were able to get them into one of their foster homes where the puppies were then born.  Unfortunately, the owners of the mom dogs only agreed to let YVPR (and, subsequently, us) take the puppies under the condition that the moms get returned to them but YVPR is going to ensure the moms spayed so they don\u2019t have to go through this again. We would love to take the mom dogs as well but, this is out of our control and we are happy to, at least, help their puppies. \n\nAs with most of our pups, we aren\u2019t sure of their mixes but the moms appear to be part Pit Bull type dogs.  They are not related but, we think the puppies may all have had the same dad as there was a Pit Bull roaming around the area and the puppies were born within a day of each other.  Of course, this is all conjecture.  \n\nThe Cookie litter (9 puppies) were born on 10/30 and the Spice Litter (11 puppies) were born on 10/31. \n\nCookie Litter:\nChocolate Chip - Male\nMacaroon - Male\nSamoa - Male\nBiscotti - Male\nGingersnap - Female\nNo-Bake - Male\nRum Ball - Male\nMacadamia - Male\nMolasses - Female\n\nSpice Litter:\nGinger - Female\nNutmeg - Female\nPepper - Male\nCocoa - Female\nCinnamon - Female\nCaper - Male\nPoppy - Female\nClove - Female\nDill - Male\nChipotle - Male\nJuniper - Female\n\nThe pups have all been in loving foster homes in groups of 2 and 3 for the last month, and have been socialized, exposed to lots of new things, and have started working on house and crate training.  Several have been with kids or kitties or adult dogs or all of these or some of these. We will be working closely with each approved applicant to determine the best fit for the adoptive puppy and the family based on what we know about their personalities and temperaments. \n\n\nPlease note that due to a large influx of applications we get for puppies, it can take several weeks for us to finish reviewing and processing them to find the best match for each individual puppy. Once adoption applications are approved, meetings will be set up with approved applicants, and, as mentioned, more information on individual puppies\u2019 temperaments will be given and we will be working with each applicant to determine the best fit for the puppy and their prospective family.  \n",

            "description": "Penny is an adorable pom-mix (she does not shed) who just wants to please and doesn\u2019t require anything more than love. She will be a wonderful addition to any family who has lots of love to spare. She likes to lie in her bed as long as she knows you are close by. If she has a little mat in the kitchen she will lay there and nap while you cook. She will get up and follow you every time you go anywhere. She loves to go on car rides and take walks as long as it\u2019s relatively flat. She is very much a lap dog and likes to be carried. She loves her bed doesn\u2019t mind wearing little outfits (that she looks adorable in).\n\nPenny is very mellow. She is good on a leash, good with other dogs, crate and house trained.  She is not a barker. She has not been around cats but we don\u2019t think she would care.  She is a little hard of hearing so you need to raise your voice to get her attention, or just make sure that she can see you.  Once she sees you she will follow you around.  She is a good eater \u2013 no left overs for her! She has not had any accidents in her foster home, but is given multiple opportunities to go outside throughout the day.  She sleeps in her crat but prefers the door left open.  We have not had her about kids but think she would do well in an adult home or home with older kids.  \n\nPenny would do well with a family who stays home most of the time, and likes to take her on little trips out.  She would do best in a home with a woman (she is ok with men but prefers women). She enjoys her daily walks, and also travels well in a dog stroller.\n\nPenny is in Yorba Linda CA, she is aged to be ~10 years old and weighs 8 \u00bd lbs.  She has some opacity in both eyes but is able to see. She is healthy, recently had a dental (jan 2021), is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations and micro chipped. If you are interested in adopting our little Miss Penny, adoption applications are available at http://bichonrescuebrigade.org/adopt/adoption-form\n",

            "description": "**If you are interested in adopting one of the puppies, please download and fill out an application from our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com. The puppies' adoption fee is $450, and they will come to their adopters spayed/neutered, microchipped, with age appropriate vaccinations, and several dewormings.** \n\nSamoa is very outgoing, confident, smart, active and playful. He would do best in a home with an adult dog to help guide him, and with an adopter who will keep up with training to ensure Samoa grows up to be the best dog possible.\n\nWe are now accepting applications for our 20 puppies, the cookie and spice litters!\n\nSee more photos of all of the puppies on their Facebook album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=forgottendogsrescue&set=a.3921486117870156\n\nIn November, we were contacted by our partners at Yakima Valley Pet Rescue (YVPR) to help with these litters of puppies. YVPR had taken in two pregnant moms (who were both in the same household) and were able to get them into one of their foster homes where the puppies were then born.  Unfortunately, the owners of the mom dogs only agreed to let YVPR (and, subsequently, us) take the puppies under the condition that the moms get returned to them but YVPR is going to ensure the moms spayed so they don\u2019t have to go through this again. We would love to take the mom dogs as well but, this is out of our control and we are happy to, at least, help their puppies. \n\nAs with most of our pups, we aren\u2019t sure of their mixes but the moms appear to be part Pit Bull type dogs.  They are not related but, we think the puppies may all have had the same dad as there was a Pit Bull roaming around the area and the puppies were born within a day of each other.  Of course, this is all conjecture.  \n\nThe Cookie litter (9 puppies) were born on 10/30 and the Spice Litter (11 puppies) were born on 10/31. \n\nCookie Litter:\nChocolate Chip - Male\nMacaroon - Male\nSamoa - Male\nBiscotti - Male\nGingersnap - Female\nNo-Bake - Male\nRum Ball - Male\nMacadamia - Male\nMolasses - Female\n\nSpice Litter:\nGinger - Female\nNutmeg - Female\nPepper - Male\nCocoa - Female\nCinnamon - Female\nCaper - Male\nPoppy - Female\nClove - Female\nDill - Male\nChipotle - Male\nJuniper - Female\n\nThe pups have all been in loving foster homes in groups of 2 and 3 for the last month, and have been socialized, exposed to lots of new things, and have started working on house and crate training.  Several have been with kids or kitties or adult dogs or all of these or some of these. We will be working closely with each approved applicant to determine the best fit for the adoptive puppy and the family based on what we know about their personalities and temperaments. \n\n\nPlease note that due to a large influx of applications we get for puppies, it can take several weeks for us to finish reviewing and processing them to find the best match for each individual puppy. Once adoption applications are approved, meetings will be set up with approved applicants, and, as mentioned, more information on individual puppies\u2019 temperaments will be given and we will be working with each applicant to determine the best fit for the puppy and their prospective family.  \n\n",

His family is having living arrangement issues.   He is located in Waco.   He loves every human he meets, is dog neutral when working, will do absolutely anything for even the smallest piece of kibble, and does enjoy a good game of tug. He is a high energy guy who loves to work, but he also has a great off switch when crated or just hanging out. He\u2019s previously lived with small dogs and children, and is reported to have done well with them, but was a bit of a bull in a China shop. Never aggressive, just overly enthusiastic. He\u2019s completed a 28 day board and train and knows sit, down, loose leash heeling, place, doorway manners, crate manners, and even some foundation agility work! He will climb on, jump over, and balance on anything! He could excel as a demo dog, trick dog, or agility dog. He also did well out hiking, and politely passed by other hikers. He was more interested in other dogs in that setting, but was easily redirected and reminded to focus. I can\u2019t think of many negatives about this guy, other than maybe the fact that he slobbers a lot when working for treats, lol! He also turns into a bit of a boy when outdoors, and likes to put his nose to the ground and jet off to sniff and pee. However, if kept engaged and working, he won\u2019t disconnect in that way. He\u2019s truly a joy to work with and brings enthusiasm to everything he does. He learns very quickly and is highly motivated!\n\nFast facts:\n- Neutered male, fully up to date on all vaccinations and veterinary care, and healthy\n- Located in Waco, TX\n- High food drive, medium toy drive\n- Very dog neutral and tolerant in a training setting\n- Loves people\n- Smart, high energy, easily trainable\n- Just turned 5 years old\n\nemail:  justine_hovden@baylor.edu\ncall/text:  254-644-2251",

            "description": "HASHBROWN & WAFFLES NEED A FOSTER OR LOVING FOREVER HOME!!!\nFosters make it possible for Dogs XL to save and care for homeless and abandoned dogs! To learn about fostering dogs like Hashbrown & Waffles, please contact us at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/volunteer/foster\n\nNames: Hashbrown & Waffles\n\nBreed: Great Pyrenees\n\nApproximate Age: 4 years old \n\nApproximate Weight: each of them is ~80 lbs but Hashbrown is taller and thinner where Waffles is shorter and stockier\n\nCurrently Living at: Local Foster Home\n\n \n\n \nDo you need more floof in your life? Adopt a pyr or TWO! Hashbrown (lighter and taller) and Waffles darker and shorter) are a bonded pair of 4 year old male, neutered Great Pyrenees mixes looking for a forever family! \n\n \n \n\n \nThese two are the definition of a bonded pair and we will not separate them. They must be within three inches of each other AT ALL TIMES - no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Sometimes they almost pee on each other when one marks a bush (or a scooter, or a tree, or a pole, or a bike, or a car tire) and the other just has to see what\u2019s going on. Alas, being attached at the hip has its benefits and its trials.  \n\n \n \n\n \nHashbrown and Waffles lived their first four years as outdoor dogs, but found themselves at a shelter for killing chickens instead of guarding them... oops. \n\n \n \n\n \nBecause they spent so long as outside dogs, they are still learning their house manners and are specifically working on house training. They like to mark things... even piles of clean laundry, but they\u2019ve come a long way towards learning that inside is not a bathroom and with frequent potty breaks, they\u2019re doing very well! We expect some regression in a new home, so keep a stash of Nature\u2019s Miracle on hand ;) \n\n \n \n\n \nThe Breakfast Boys (TM) have good leash manners and won\u2019t pull you in opposite directions since, ya know, they\u2019re attached at the hip, but they do like to chase squirrels so beware they hunt as a pair, and although they\u2019ll enjoy occasional strolls, they\u2019re looking for a family with a fenced in yard so they can wrestle with each other to their hearts\u2019 content. Typical pyrs, these two aren\u2019t exactly quiet either, but unlike your average GP, Hashbrown and Waffles ARE quite trainable! Just make sure you have good treats on hand or they\u2019re not interested. \n\n \n \n\n \nThe Breakfast Club has welcomed other canine members with open paws, but would be perfectly happy to be your two and only as well! They can be a little too eager about small animals, and given their history, we would not recommend a home with cats. \n\n \n \n\n \nHashbrown and Waffles are incredibly friendly, loving and affectionate with people, but are just as happy to occupy themselves with a toy or take a nap in the same room as their people if you\u2019re busy. Pyrs might shed and double the pyr means double the floof but you can always use their fur to knit a blanket to keep you warm this winter! The Breakfast Boys are total love bugs and they\u2019re worth every bit of mischief they may cause.\n\n \n \n\n \nHashbrown and Waffles are looking for a forever home who will welcome them both (we will not separate them).\n\n \n \n\nHashbrown & Waffles need a foster or a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on them. Please open your heart and home to \"DOG NAME\"!\n\n\nThe adoption fee for this pair is $600, which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the application online at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire\n\n \n\nThank you for considering adoption and helping to save a life!\n \n\nPlease visit us online at www.DogsXLRescue.org",

Unfortunately her family could no longer care for her and decided to surrender her to one of the shelters we work with. We are so happy we were able to take her in. She has a big personality, is confident and very playful. When Camila is not zooming around our fields she enjoys a good belly rub and is sweet and affectionate, but she is not a lapdog. She has more of a big dog personality. She is very alert, curious and aware of her surroundings; she doesn't miss a beat. She would do great in an active home that gives her ample daily exercise. She much rather zoom around outside in our fields than pay attention to toys and she loves it when her humans zoom around with her!",

Dixie is a smart girl who would love to learn new skills and tricks through positive reinforcement training. Dixie came to us as a stray so her history is a mystery, but she may not have known the love and comfort of an indoor home before. She would love to learn all about that life... with you!

Like so many lovebug pitbulls, Fawn thinks she's a lap dog and will happily climb aboard to sit on your lap for kisses and cuddles. She loves a good belly scratch and will let you know if you stop too soon!\n\nDainty and easy to walk, Fawn enjoys to go for walks to sniff the flowers and see what's going on in the neighborhood. Although she's low energy around the house, she will happily go for short runs or hikes. She is friendly to all new people she meets, and not really interested other dogs.\n\nQuiet and mellow in the house, Fawn will only bark to alert you if there's someone outside the house or the UPS truck is making their deliveries on your street.\n\nShe loves treats, and will shake your hand to say thank you!\n\nFawn is a very loving and mellow dog, and will make someone such a wonderful loyal and loving companion. She is calm and very sweet around children, and just an overall gem of a dog. We are all a little bit in love with this beautiful and kind natured senior lady.\n\nFawn is 9 years old, 65 lbs, and ready for her forever home!

He would do best in an active family who would love to do obedience and /or agility classes with him.\n\nHe is very sweet though and seems to be a smart dog who will learn fast.

Baylee was never taken to the vet to get spayed or any other annual vaccinations; so she is heartworm positive and is undergoing treatment for this which will take a couple of moths. Baylee also had several litters, and this is how the rescue found out about her. The owner could not \"get rid\" of the puppies from her last litter, so we took the puppies, but we wanted to be apart of the solution. A very compassionate donor sponsored her spay while we were looking for a foster to prevent further litters. We are heppy she is apart of the Castaways Crew now because she is a very sweet dog, she loves to sleep on her dog bed, she is house broken, and loves to romp around the yard and hunt squirrels. She is currently living in a foster home with one other dog and an infant, and she is very loving and tolerant of both.",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Apollo, a 3 year old full bred husky. I need a lot of exercise, 1-2 mile walks each day keep me out of trouble. I prefer a raw meat diet but have been weaned on to Blue Buffalo food as well. \nI'm potty and kennel trained. Still working on walking with a leash without trying to pull you on a sled! \nI like cats and love other dogs. I'm not great with small children though. I'll need a home where I can be outside most of the time but beware, I'm an escape artist! A 6ft fence is mandatory. I am an adventurer at heart and sometimes too smart for my own good. I like to howl and rarely bark. If I could sleep in the snow I would because it feels so great!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

            "description": "Meet Raddix! \n\nRaddix is estimated to be 1 years old and 15lbs. Raddix arrived in Wisconsin after being surrendered with his litter mates.  Since he has lived his entire life with his siblings, Raddix is learning how to be independently confident.  Raddix is a very sweet but shy boy who will need a home that is willing to be patient with him. Once he comes out of his shell, Raddix loves attention and he loves to play.  Raddix is doing very well with learning how to share and process stimuli.  His foster feels he will be a great dog to go hiking with or walking on the trails.  It will take time to get him confident enough to that point but this boy is well worth the patience. Raddix is beyond sweet.  He loves to give kisses and loves turning over for belly rubs.  He is very interested in children and wags his tail when he sees them.  Since he is still working on his confidence, he will need a home without young children for now. Raddix would do well with another confident dog in the house.  Raddix is very quiet when he is left alone but when it comes to sleep time he wants to share your bed! \n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

            "description": "A Good Samaritan scooped Ripley up off the side of the road as his foot left a trail of bloody paw prints and he staggered from side to side; the chainlink catching the sun with each step. They brought sweet Ripley to the Texas Shelter. Staff prepared the bolt cutters as they went to remove the piece of chain that was embedded so deeply into Ripley's neck it required sedation. His toe is fractured and buckshot litters his head and skull. Ripley was a target in someone's sick game. \n\nRipley was networked immediately and his story went unnoticed. The sea of dogs in need engulfed his plea. No one stepped up and no one was able to help. And then we were contacted here at 4P4L. We will have Ripley transported into our care the week of Jan 13th and hope to have a family waiting.\n\nHe seems fearful of other dogs at this time, though with decompression and love, that could change.\n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time. When we do, it will be updated here. This is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

            "description": "Meet Raffi! One-year-old, 20# Raffi only knew an outdoor pen and the company of her littermates before she came to Wisconsin. While not mistreated, she never had the chance to learn to live in a house with people. Raffi is a sweet, playful and assertive girl who is adapting daily to her new foster home. She loves outdoor play, then chills out when inside. \n Raffi would do best in a home without young children due to her energy level and need for a quiet, consistent environment. With long legs and a delicate face, she decorates any space. \n Raffi is working on leash and house training. She barks at cats but otherwise is non-aggressive towards them. And gosh, does she FLY when chasing backyard squirrels!\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

I Love to chase balls. I am house trained. I love to chew. (Need bones around ). I sleep well in my kennel. I do well with other dogs, not sure about cats. I do have a hind leg that got hurt and I did not receive the proper care. Since I entered the rescue many weeks ago, I have received my FHO surgery and I am now recovering and learning how to put pressure on my hind leg and use it as I went so long not be able to use it so I now have to reteach myself. Please read up on what a FHO is but once healed I should live a happy healthy life. \nI am looking forward to a FOREVER HOME Apply at michelesrescue.com",

            "description": "Capo is estimated to be somewhere between 5-7 yrs old. His paperwork says 7 but he displays a slightly younger personality and energy. He is very eager to please people, smart and ready to learn, takes corrections well and responds better to affection/attention reward faster than he does food reward with the exception of the mastiff butt-plant when he doesn't want to go somewhere. He is doing very well with training and acclimations to an inside the home environment. He's an absolute love who needs someone to show him who the leader is, leep him challenged intellectually and physically. \n\nHe needs the confidence and trust in his human, built from consistency and positive interaction/direction/redirection to make him his best pupper. As a slightly insecure dog, he does become overstimulated easliy. His anxiety response is to mount, hump or chew. The chewing presents more if the attention is withdrawn but he can still see the person he wants attention. Because of his humping and mouthing behaviors and easliy overstimulated, he is not recommended for any family with rambunctious play atmosphere or small children. He would be best with the only dog. He exhibits interest in playing with cats but no aggression or prey drive. He does really well with cats. We prefer Capo be an only dog, however he ok around other calm dogs. He will resource guard for attention (not toys or food), so when other dogs get attention, Capo will react. So, he needs a home that is familiar with this insecure behavior, will continue to crate him (it's his safe place and used for downtime), and will be consistent with Capo. Like most dogs, Capo wants your direction, he strives to make his person happy and is a very smart boy. He can be mouthy when he wants affection or play time with you. While he is gently about being mouthy, we are working on redirecting this behavior and would like a family that would continue to do the same for him. \n\nHe is not neutered yet due to a skin infection that has to heal first. Once healed the infection is not expected to be a reoccurring issue. He is up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. In the few weeks Capo has been with his foster, he has been learning, adjusting, and seeking a human bond. We hope to find him the perfect family he can begin to build this bond with. He is a very good boy who needs his fur-ever family with a calmer home to help him relax, continue to build confidence, and will take him on walks.",

Ritz is a friendly, playful pup who will greet you with tail wags and a gentle lean in for the good scratches! If given the green light, he will happily land in your lap for a proper snuggle. Ritz waits patiently to get ready for walks and will happily lead the way. \n\nRitz has been described as a \"dream in the home\" and already knows a handful of commands like \"sit\", \"down\", and \"leave it\". He is highly treat motivated, loves to play, and always looks forward to learning new tricks. He is very eager to take part in all family activities and truly sticks to his favorite people like glue. He will be a great addition to an active, adult-only family that can take him on several long walks a day and continue to work on his obedience training and leash manners. Ritz prefers the serenity of rural life as the sights and sounds of the city can be overwhelming for him. He would love to find an experienced and confident family that will help him feel safe and stay calm around big vehicles, loud noises, and other dogs. Ritz can be picky when it comes to dogs so he prefers to be the only dog in the home so he can soak up all the attention and treats you have to offer. While Ritz is small in stature, he is big on needing plenty of space, so an apartment or small condo would not be his ideal living environment. His dream home is one with a fenced yard with grass as far as the eye can see for him to play fetch and explore the outdoors. Ritz is looking forward to finding his forever home so come meet him today! \n\nEstimated DOB: 11/13/19",

When I went to my foster home it was amazing, there were all these people and dogs I met and did so good with them. I get so happy when I see people that I can\u2019t stop wiggling. I have very long legs so when I walk I have like a little dance step in me. I have done so good that my foster dad took me to see my foster mom at work and boy did I love that place because everyone I met had treats for me!! So to my forever family out there.....I love car rides, walks, cuddling, most of all I love seeing people! Oh and treats I love, love, love treats!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

We have had her to the cardiologist twice and she seems to be doing well.\nShe loves to go on  walks but obviously only moderate exercise for her!\nUnfortunately due to her heart issue which she was born with we have been advised by the vet not to spay her as putting her under general anesthesia is dangerous.\nThe cardiologist  diagnosed a heart valve issue.  Her medication is not terribly expensive, around $25 per month.  We have been told she will be fine as she tolerates the medication very well and just needs to have a vet check up every 6 months by her primary  vet. Cardiologist is not necessary.\nShe was fine for the groomer recently. She would enjoy a home with at least 1 person home most of the time.\nIf you are interested in adopting sweet LILY please go to our website www.somersetcottagepoodlerescue.org and click on adopt to download the application \n\nLILY 'S adoption donation is $695\n\n",

His instinct is to put his nose to the ground and patrol the fields when he catches a scent. He genuinely believes this is his duty and he loves every minute of it! He really enjoys being around people and wants to be apart of the conversation. He doesn't like to be alone in his kennel and watch other dogs play, so he will let you know by being vocal about it. He quickly quiets down once he gets your attention; he just wants to be with you as much as possible. \nNot only is he handsome but he has the most amazing coat. It feels like silk to touch and sparkles in the sunlight. He also loves treats and knows how to \"sit even though it takes him a minute to get there. \nHunter is an outgoing and friendly fellow and we love his personality.",

Quaid\u2019s cute markings and short coat come from her lab and black mouth cur mix. She is about 3 years old and 50 pounds. Quaid does well with kids, but we are unsure of how she does with cats. She does well with some dogs PENDING a meet and greet and an APPROPRIATE introduction. Quaid likes to play and go on walks, but she\u2019s down to just hangout too. She is completely vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $250. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and FILL OUT AN APPLICATION if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee!",

            "description": "**Please read Major's entire profile, which includes a link to the adoption application. Thank you!** \n\nMeet Major, a one year old, 48 pound, Labrador/Heeler mix young fellow.\n\nMajor's first family down south took him to the vet for a check-up and never came back. It's hard to understand how they could have parted from such a sweet, handsome boy.\n\nA loving young dog that loves to follow his humans around, Major's very playful and active. He enjoys going on runs. He needs an active family that will get him plenty of exercise and include him in their adventures, and a fence would be ideal. (He is not suited to an apartment setting.)\n\nMajor's very smart and learns quickly. He is working with his foster and has already learned lie down, come, and stay. He is still working on sit! He is getting better and better on a leash. He is also house and crate trained, and sleeps through the night in his crate. He's still a puppy in many ways, and needs a family that will continue his training.\n\nHe loves everyone he meets and gets along great with other dogs. Major thinks children are the best friends ever and is very gentle with them. However, he has shown some signs of resource guarding with high value items like bones. With that and his energy level we recommend a family with teens and above.\n\nMajor tested positive for Heartworm once he came north and his treatment is in process. The cost of treatment will be covered by Great Dog Rescue at our veterinarian. However, his furever family has to be committed to getting him to his appointments.\n\nA world class snuggler and cuddler, Major loves attention and follows his humans around - he's already a great companion and will continue to blossom with his furever family.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Major, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

I came to Wisconsin all the way from Texas with my 6 newborn puppies - and now that they've all gotten big and been adopted I'm looking for a furever home of my own. I'm a very sweet dog but I can get really anxious in new situations or meeting new people, so I'll need a family that's pretty dog-savvy or ready to learn a lot about canine body language. I think I would get pretty overwhelmed by the exciting antics of young children, so would prefer a home of teenagers and/or adults. I'm very intelligent and respond quickly to positive reinforcement, and I have been learning all sorts of skills at the shelter; I'm excited to learn even more in a home. I spent some time in a foster home and they said I'm really good about housetraining and crate training. I am a little particular about my dog friends, but like playing with compatible pups so if you have an energetic and social dog we might be a great team! If you think you are a good fit for a girl like me, contact the shelter today!",

            "description": "Our southern belle, \"Delta Dawn\", has completed her time in foster care and is headed to the farm to find a furever family of her own. Delta is a middle aged hound girl and weighs about 65 lbs. It was very clear to her foster mom that Delta had never experienced any of the finer things in life that a dog would love such as a warm house to relax the days away, a loving family to keep her safe, and dog friends to play with. She is slowly, but surely warming up to the idea of being a furry family member and has made great strides since joining her foster family a couple months ago. She can now walk on a leash, where before she had no clue what that long rope attached to her collar was, and loves to go exploring and follow her hound nose to all the wonderful smells along the way. When she is in a fenced yard, she loves to get any zoomies out by running the yard a few times. She has also mastered the \"sit\" Command and even offers a little paw up while sitting, which she threw in all by herself for extra cuteness. She's very treat motivated and with a little work she's sure to master any other skills you may want her to possess. Delta has fallen in love with all people she's come in contact with and has learned the humans mean her no harm and just want to enjoy her company. She loves to come over for head scratches and ear rubs. She enjoyed the kids in her foster home, but would probably do best in a home with older kids. Delta does get nervous when it comes to loud noises or chaos, but we're sure that would only get better with time as she's more comfortable in her new home. She would like to request that her new family give her the time and patience to warm up to her new environment, but once she does, she has a lot of love to give and is truly a super super sweet gal that will offer years of companionship.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

I love to go on walks and sniff my soundings, as much as I love to curl up for a good nap! I am not always to confident meeting other dogs, so I'd love to meet your pups here at the shelter before I go home! I would love a refresher on some of my house rules and manners, but it's a great way to show my new family just how smart I am! Kids can be a little spooky sometimes, so I'd prefer a family with older kids who know to give me space when I need it. I know I will make a family so happy to have me. \n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy! Thanks to Chapman BMW Camelback you can take me home for FREE!\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL thinks I MUST MEET all dogs in home prior to being adopted \nAAWL recommends I live with humans HIGH SCHOOL AGE or older.\nAAWL thinks I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE\nAAWL thinks I have the potential to live with cats.",

Slobberin likes some dogs, but not all. He will require a meet and greet if a potential adopter has another dog in the home.\nAdopted animals are not able to go to their new home until spay and neuter surgery has been done.

            "description": "Meet Peanut! \n\nThis sweet boy is coming up from Fort Worth, Texas this SATURDAY, January 9th, and is ready for a foster or foster to adopt home! \n\nHe is coming from Texas and is ready for his fresh start! Peanut\u2019s cute markings and short coat come from his chihuahua mix. He is about 9 pounds and 9 years old, which means that he\u2019s got 9 years of love stored up for you! Peanut would do best in a home WITHOUT children and will coexist with a dog, but he would prefer to be the center of attention! Peanut is looking for lots of love and affection! We are unsure how he does with cats. Peanut loves to play and go on walks, but he\u2019s totally down to just hangout and snuggle too! Peanut is completely vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $200. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and FILL OUT AN APPLICATION if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee!",

            "description": "Sophie is a two year old female Border Collie. She is spayed , potty and crate trained. A very affectionate dog that just wants to please. She will sit, shake hands and give you a high five. But what she really wants is to keep your lap warm as you watch TV. She likes to herd and can be possessive of her owner so might be best to be a one and only dog. She has done well with visiting grandchildren. She will require a fenced in yard. To apply to adopt visit\nwww.handsofhoperescue.com/adoptapp\n. No phone calls please. Sophie'\n\ns adoption fee is $250. All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. This dog is fostered in Great Bend, KS and adopter must drive to pick up. We do not ship or deliver. We do allow out of state adoptions, however qualified in state applications will be given preference. Please Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs.

When doing a D2D with a playful helper dog, dog is a frontal greeter with a foward posture and tries to mount other dog. Did not take to corrections from helper dog, pulls very hard on the leash to get closer to other dog. Unable to complete full handling at this time. Type: Behavior Date animal needs rescue by: (remove date) Impound type: Return Additional notes: Returned due to dog being too strong for adopters wife and child to handle, dog pulls very hard on leash and can manuver her way out of a harness. Adopter stated that Luna gets very focused when she sees another dog and will pull as hard as she can to get to the other dog. Adopter stated that Luna responds very well to her squeaky toy, and he was able to stop her from chasing other dogs using her favorite squeaky toy. Luna was very loose and friendly on intake, as soon as i kenneled her in surrender she became agressive again barking and lunging through the kennel. ATrujillo/ERobinson",

She will take several days to a week to warm up to new people but she is not aggressive at all.\n\nShe came from a person who was a hoarder and had over 50 dogs in a small trailer. She loves the company of dogs over people. She has been in our rescue now for a little over 1 yr because it\u2019s taken her that long to learn to trust. She used to run and hide and now she enjoys coming out sitting in your lap for pets. \n\nShe loves to be around other dogs so she would be best in a home with another dog.  She does have skin allergies and needs an allergy shot once a month, if not she\u2019ll continue to scratch and her fur will fall out. \n\nShe is house trained and can now walk on a leash. Raven needs someone that will be patient with her.  Her foster has a puppy and she enjoys playing with him. She doesn\u2019t care much for toys. Not good with small children only because she is so shy. So best in a home with kids 12 yrs and up.  \n\nIf you are interested in Raven, please complete the on-line application or contact us for more information.",

She was picked up with another male dog but we have not kenneled her with anybody yet so we can't say how she is going to be with other dogs at this time. From what we have seen it will likely be based on how the other dog reacts to her because she has pretty much ignored everybody they the fence unless they charge her. She likes a good butt scratching and has been very good with the volunteers but we don't know how she is with cats or small kids because we don't have any here to see how she is. She is ready to start looking for her new forever home.\n\nPLEASE e-mail (do not call) mike@caaronline.org for more information and to set up an appointment to adopt. Do not e-mail us with a request to call you, if you have a question please ask in the e-mail.\n\nAll dog are adopted on a first come - first served basis.\n\nCentral Arizona Animal Rescue is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 corporation.\n\nWe are located in San Tan Valley, AZ.\n\nIf you have other dogs already, you must bring them for introduction prior to adoption.\nFollow us on Facebook - www.facebook.com/CentralArizonaAnimalRescue\n\nWE DO NOT TAKE OWNER SURRENDERS - If you are looking to surrender a dog, take them to the county animal control in the county you reside in.

Spud lived in a very small space in his own urine and feces. He likely NEVER got outside and because of that he\u2019s very overweight at 125lbs. He needs to lose 15-20lbs.  He also has a few other health issues we will manage.\n\nSpud is sweet, smart, smiley guy who has risen above the circumstances he found himself in due to human neglect. He has proven that at the shelter when he was first seized, the staff fell in love with him! I mean look at that smile!\n\nSpud is excellent with other dogs and has no issue with cats! Given his large size, we recommend kids 12+!\n\nSpud is in a medical foster for now to jump-start his diet and exercise routine. He will be available for adoption in 3-4weeks (1/8/2020).  However, we are beginning to take applications. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Spud, please apply at www.twotailzrescue.org!",

These two sweet boys were removed from a mobile home by the state police and our volunteer HPO after neighbors had not seen anyone at the home for 10 days.\nChristian us a 2 year old neutered male blue nose pit with the sweetest, most loving disposition. He is so happy to just give kisses and go for walks. Dior is a year old tan and white pittie who lives to chase his tail and roll in the mud! Both of these sweethearts have been raised with cats that were also taken out of the home at the time of the seizure, and there was also a baby living in the home. These two boys are very bonded and need to go to a hone together. They are also wonderful with other dogs, especially one that will join in their play.once you meet them you will fall in love with their faces, their personality and their gentleness.\nApplications for this bonded pair can be found at petsearchpa.org or https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PAPS/Dog",

Duke was living alone at the mobile homes while arrangements were being made for him to go to a rescue. Once Duke arrived, took Him a few days to realize that he was not going to be abandoned again; now he loves to play and run in the yard. We are still assessing his dog and cat skills and not sure about children. Duke is housebroken, crate trained and is now neutered. He is 4DX tested, fully vaccinated and microchipped. Once he gets to know you, he be your best friend! Applications can be found at petsearchpa.org or https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PAPS/Dog",

Here's the link: DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PPAS/Dog\n\nAtlas is a happy go lucky male shepherd mix with an estimated DOB of 08/12/2017. He weighed 63.6 lbs at intake.  Atlas came to us as a transfer from another shelter.  Atlas loves to romp around in the play yard and when he is done running about he loves to cuddle and bury his head in your lap. He loves to play with another dog that likes to play to the max. Ready to give this sweet boy a wonderful new home? His adoption fee is $190 which includes a medical exam, sterilization surgery, age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormer, heartworm testing, and a microchip.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. As we get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur animals change daily, so please check our lists of adoptable dogs and adoptable cats frequently. Once you find an animal you\u2019d like to adopt, the next steps are to complete an application and request a meet and greet with the foster. Make sure to be thorough and help us understand why you\u2019re interested in that particular animal \u2014 and why your home is a great fit. Based on your answers we may even have a better fit for you.\n\nAll PPAS dogs are up to date on all of their vaccines (including rabies if age appropriate), and will be microchipped and registered in the adopter's name at the time of adoption. Adopters get a free consultation at an area vet partner within 14 days of adoption. Any dog that is six months of age or older will be tested for Heartworms and if found negative, will be kept on Heartworm prevention during their shelter stay, after the adoption it is up to the adopter to continue the highly recommended Heartworm preventative treatment. Also all PPAS shelter dogs are treated with a monthly topical flea/tick preventative and we ask that adopters continue that treatment as well.  All dogs and cats per state law are sterilized before they begin their new fabulous lives with their new families.\n\nAdoption fees: Adoption fees must be paid in full at time of adoption \u2013 no partial payments are accepted. All major credit cards are accepted. Adoption fees vary. Please note if you live in the city of Ottawa a dog license fee must also be paid at time of adoption. Annual renewal of dog licenses is required between January 1st and February 15th.\n\nTaking your animal home: The State of Kansas requires that all cats and dogs must be sterilized (spayed/neutered) before going to their new homes. In most cases animals will have already been sterilized before being placed on the adoption floor and you will be able to take your new companion home with you the day of adoption. However, if the animal is not yet sterilized, they will need to stay at the shelter and we will schedule the surgery on the next available date (usually within a week). We do request that all dogs go home with a collar/leash.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please either email Prairie Paws Animal Shelter at info@prairiepaws.org, for an application or visit our website @ prairiepaws.org for more information.\n\nPrairie Paws Animal Shelter\n3173 HWY K68\nOttawa, KS 66067\n785-242-2967\nprairiepaws.org\ninfo@prairiepaws.org",

These boys were surrendered when their elderly owners were not able to care for such young energetic dogs, so they were put out in the barn.  We are very grateful that their owners recognized this was no life for these brothers and were able to get them to us to find a new and loving home where they can get the best care and attention.  Both boys are very happy guys and like other dogs and people.  They should be fine with kids.  A fenced yard will be needed to help them get enough exercise.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

Dante chased after the car and out of sight. This all happened just below our rescue and was witnessed by a volunteer. Several days later, he was at our gates. We knew he needed help, had no other option, but was too afraid to come in. We set a trap and quickly caught him. We could easily see that he was a house dog by his physical condition, but his short time on the streets showed fresh scars and scabs around his muzzle and body...clearly not a tough guy, but a loving lab. He's a good boy and walks well on a leash. Two words that best describe this sweet boy are Super Lovable! Due to flight limitations, we are only able to ship to our two adoption partners safely, upper East Coast and Minnesota. Dante is fully vetted, sterilized and ready to find his forever home. His adoption fee is $425 and includes transportation off the island of Puerto Rico. We are an all volunteer adoption team and appreciate your patience.\n\n",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Meet Nipsy! Nipsy is a lovely 1-year-old mixed-breed lady who currently weighs about 46 pounds. She came to SFAS after her previous guardian could no longer care for her. Here at the shelter Nipsy has been a little shy at first but once she warms up to you she becomes very exuberant and outgoing towards people. Nipsy is a bit particular about her dog friends so If you have another dog(s) at home please let the scheduler know you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet so that we can make sure everyone gets along well before going home. Nipsy's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed, microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. Interested in meeting with Nipsy or being added to her waitlist? Please call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

Walnut is a friendly and affectionate dog who has been a little bit nervous in the shelter environment and would much prefer a cozy home. In addition to sharing his kennel with Nutcracker, Walnut did well when meeting other PACC dogs in playgroup. He was a bit nervous at first, but after he warmed up, he was social and tolerant of the other dogs. Staffers say Walnut is a super sweet boy who loves pets and affection. Walnut would like to meet any resident pets before heading home, and is looking for a home without small dogs. Ask about this sweet nutty buddy today!",

            "description": "Hi! My official name is Ginger Snap, but folks just call me Ginger. We think I am a Beagle mix about 2-3 years old. They do not know much about my past except that I was not taken care of very well. I was tied up in someone's back yard and pretty much ignored. When the food ran out, they just stopped feeding me. I finally managed to break loose and was wandering around the neighborhood when I walked out in front of a car. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a wonderful couple that works with a dog rescue. They brought me in to the rescue, got me all cleaned up and gave me plenty of food and a warm place to sleep each night. At first, I did not know how to play with the other dogs, but they soon showed me the ropes and now we get along great! I love playing outside with the other dogs but then I like to come inside for some snuggle time and sit on the couch with my foster daddy and get some belly rubs! I need a home with a fenced yard where I can run and play, and I would love someone to play with. I am still a little nervous with new people and places. But once I get to know you, I love everyone. I have been spayed and I am up to date on my shots. Unfortunately, I tested light positive for heartworms. The good news is the vet says I should be all clear very soon if I keep up my monthly treatments. Fortunately, the rescue will continue to provide my medicine until I am heartworm negative. Being in the house is still kinda new for me but I am doing my best to be a good girl. We are working on some crate training; I don't really care for it but they say it is necessary at times and it helps keep me out of trouble.\n\nI am looking for a furever family that will be patient and understand that I am still young and trying to learn all the rules. I need guidance and understanding. I am going to make mistakes, but I need a loving family that will teach me the right things to do and still love me even when I mess up. In return I will be your loving and faithful companion for life!\n\nIf you are interested in giving Ginger Snap a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal. We review them on a first come first served basis. If your application is approved, we will contact you and allow you the opportunity to adopt. If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us and we will be glad to help!",

            "description": "Hollie is a 1.5 year old spayed female purebred German Shepherd. SHE IS A VERY SPECIAL GIRL! She was given up by her owners due because they were moving away and knew she needed special care. Hollie was vomiting and was suspected to have some kind of liver disease going on. After we rescued her, we immediately got started on diagnostics for Hollie. She received a full bloodwork panel and then went on to undergo a CT scan. Unfortunately, Hollie was diagnosed with a congenital portosystemic liver shunt, along with hundreds of smaller acquired shunting vessels. \n\nHollie is not a candidate for surgery and will need to be managed on daily medications. This includes only feeding her a special diet (Hill's L/d liver care dry food), daily administration of Lactulose, Denamarin liver support supplements, and daily antibiotics. \n\nWith good supportive care, Hollie is able to live a normal life. She is housebroken, crate trained, VERY SMART, and loves to spend time at the dog park. She is a very sweet, and LOYAL dog. Hollie does well with other dogs in the house as part of the pack, but would be fine being an only dog as well. Hollie's adoption fee is $350 and we are interested in serious applicants only that understand Hollie's condition and will be able to provide this girl with the support and care that she needs for the rest of her life. \n\nFoster home location: Maple Grove, MN\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.castawaypetrescue.org and fill out an adoption application. An adoption counselor will contact you. Please note that adoption counselors will only know of your interest if you submit an application. They do not see emails sent to the administration email account. The adoption counselor can answer your questions when they call after receiving your application. Please remember we are an all volunteer organization.\n\nMinimum Adoption Donation is $350 (includes deworming, microchip with free registration, age appropriate vaccinations, spay and 30 days of health insurance). Any donation above the minimum is appreciated\n\nFoster Home Location: Maple Grove, MN\n\nOur organization uses 24PetWatch microchips, which include free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service.

Both boys are very happy guys and like other dogs and people.  They should be fine with kids.  A fenced yard will be needed to help them get enough exercise.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.

For this reason, he'd do better in a house without a lot of traffic in and out and new people to stress him. He's a mouthy player, meaning he always does best with a toy in his mouth to keep busy, and he needs heavy duty ones! He weighs in at an impressive 90 lbs. He's a gorgeous dog! He's not yet cat-tested. He has been ok with a larger male dog but didn\u2019t like a smaller male in one home that tried him. He has had no issues With female dogs. A meet and greet with any current pets to ensure  compatibility is required. \n\n** Enzo also would really benefit from a fenced-in yard where he can exercise off some of his energy. His fosters (who don't have a fenced in yard) were taking him on multiple mile-plus walks per day, and he STILL had excess energy to burn.\n\nContact us for more details as we continue to get more information from our foster.\n\nAdoption fee covers: all vetting to age (including deworming, deflea etc ), spay/neuter (to be done at 6-8 months of age if not already done and included in adoption fee,  free 30 days of pet insurance, 6 week obedience course (or reimbursement for positive-based classes), and lifetime support of rescue.\n\nPlease fill out an application here for consideration: Tinyurl.Com/appshdr\n\n* During this COVID-19 crisis, we are essentially doing only virtual application processing and meetings are using social distancing practices. We will not have any open hours until further notice and doing meet and greets by appointment with the utmost caution for personal safety. We are not a shelter so there are NO DOGS AT THE SHOP unless we have open hours. All our dogs are in foster care and are available to be seen by appointment.\n\nNOTE: If a dog is listed as Adoptable, he or she is still available at that time. Also, our adoption area is within a several hour radius of us in Rochester, NY (NOT including Canada - sorry!)",

Estimated to have been born 6/1/16, and weighing in at 11 lbs, she enjoys going for long walks and playing with her toys.\n\nShe is very protective when it comes to eating and will guard her food, so she needs to be separated from other pets while eating or receiving treats. She is potty trained and knows how to use a pee pad also.  She knows how to use a doggie door, but will need a high fenced yard since she has the ability of jumping right over shorter fences.\n\nFeliz would do best in a home where she is the only Princess since she is very much an alpha dog, and a home without children since she can become possessive and protective of her human.\n\nIf you are looking for a loyal companion, please complete an application found at http://rescueachi.com/adoption-application/ and her foster family will give you a call so you can see if you and she would be the perfect fit.\n",

            "description": "Berry is a compact little girl.  She weighs in just under 40 pounds.  She's approximately 6 years old, up to date on all vaccines,  preventions and is heartworm negative after completing treatment.  ?\nBerry is a happy and friendly little girl!  She is dog friendly (cats and little dogs are unknown), housebroken and walks well on a leash.  Berry greets everyone she meets with excitement and exuberance.   She's a little too \"in your face \" for some dogs who don't appreciate that greeting.  Children over 8 would be best for Berry,  as she can be jumpy.  \nIt's been obvious that Berry has spent her life as an object in a home, not a member of the family.  She probably spent a majority of her time living in a crate. ?  Berry has made so much progress accepting love and affection from her people while with us her.  She snuggles up close in bed at night. ?\nIf you are interested in Berry, please message us here or email us at lovetotherescueinc@gmail.com.  Email inquiries only\n\nBerry is located in Spring Hill,  Pasco County.",

He was left with the client by a friend and he never came back to pick him up and they already had 3 dogs.  He is getting neutered on January 22, 2021 and will be available for adoption after that.  Chase has been very good at the foster's home and gets along with all the dogs and is fine with cats.  He goes outside to go potty but does wear a bellyband in the house.  He was never trained.  Once he is neutered and the testosterone leaves his system he more than likely with do much better.  Belly bands are wonderful for training male dogs.  He is very affectionate and loves attention.  He also loves to play with other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog to play with, large or small, he doesn't care.\n\nChase's adoption fee includes his/her 1st grooming/bath, spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccinations, fecal, heartworm tests, flea/tick treatment if required, microchip, collar, and any other vet care that's required during his/her stay with us.  Adoption Donation is:  $300\n\nPlease fill out an application at cryforhelprescue.com if you are interested in meeting Chase.\n\nSee all our adoptable dogs and fill out an online application now at http://www.cryforhelprescue.com.

Moose was an owner surrender situation, where he kept escaping the yard because his previous owners had a short fence. He is extremely friendly with people, and he can be a bit jumpy when he is excited. Moose gets along with other big dogs, but he should not go to a home with small dogs or cats. He must go to a home with a 6ft fence or higher. Moose does need some work on his basic manners and he does pull on a leash. He is a BIG boy who definitely doesn\u2019t know his size. He needs a strong breed experienced owner who can handle a big boy with an even bigger heart.",

This goofy but bashful girl needs a loving, patient, low-traffic, adult-only home to succeed; she has a history of being uneasy with new people and apartment life would be too stressful for this sensitive girl. Tuesday is a very loving lady who will bond strongly to her person (can you say \"BFFL\"?) and would prefer a home where she can be your constant companion. She would love to both curl up with you on the couch AND also go on mountain adventures, swim in the river, chase the ball, or go on a trail run. She may prefer to be the only pet -- cats are just so much fun to chase, and though she has played successfully with other pups outside of the home in the past, she can have trouble sharing her belongings with canine companions. If Tuesday sounds like the right fit for you, please fill out a Pet & People profile!\n\nCOVID-19 Adoption Health and Safety:\n\nWhile we remain closed for walk-ins, adoptions by appointment are available Wednesday and Friday - Monday.\n\nFirst step for interested adopters is filling out our online Pet & People profile at www.myhswm.org, \n\nFor more adoption information please call us at 406-549-3934.",

            "description": "*NEEDS ANOTHER DOG/NEEDS A YARD* SPECIAL NEEDS*Hello - I'm Ollie! I'm a Maltese/Papillon mix that is 6 years old and 6 pounds of adorableness! I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue found me in the shelter when I was super skinny and looking for a family. With lots of love and care, I've been filling out and discovering what this world has to offer. My vision is impaired, I can't see very well so it will take me a while to learn how to navigate the house. I still bump into chairs and the wall sometimes but I know how to use the doggy door and do my business. I have two eye medications so whoever adopts me will need to give me drops and ointment 2 times a day for the rest of my life. But trust me, I'm worth it! I discovered that I love toys and my favorites kinds are: crinkly toys, hard chewy toys and squeaky toys-in that order. I love being around adults, teens and kids. I also LOVE to play with my foster brothers - I can play all day long so if you have other playful dogs, you're the family for me because I will fit right in. When I'm not playing with my siblings, my most favorite thing to do is cuddle with my person and I must insist that I sleep in your arms every night. Let me show you how much I will love you and I will always want to be with you and will follow you to the ends of the earth. Be sure to watch my video!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet checkClick here to watch a video of Ollie Oxen.",

He is a gentle, calm, affectionate boy with low-medium energy who likes kids, has good leash manners and is currently learning basic commands in his foster home.  He would like to be an only dog and he is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  A home with a fenced yard or possibly a retired couple who likes to walk daily would be ideal.  Beau is HW+ so he is currently available for a foster-to-adopt situation until his HW treatment is complete and he is medically cleared for adoption. If you are not familiar with Heartworm disease, dogs get it from mosquitos and it is not contagious. It is easily prevented and highly treatable, but requires extended rest during treatment.\n\nFor more information about Beau, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Please note donations using the SPONSOR ME tab will not go to Fluffy Dog Rescue.\n\nTo Locate Our Application go to http://rescue.fluffydog.net/how-to-adopt.html\n\nOur listings are updated throughout the day. If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx.  8 months (1/8) WEIGHT: approx. 18 lbs.  WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/9) \n\nMY STORY: Scruffy is an adorable boy that loves people. With that said, he is a shy dog when he first meets people and for some time after that. If he is pushed, he could bite, therefore, we will not place him in a home with children under 16 years of age. We are also only adopting to people who have dog experience. They will need to have patience with him and he will be great. He will always be wary of people who are new in the home and should not be pushed to interact with them. In his own time he will adjust to his surroundings. Because of this he is considered a flight risk. He can never be offleash and would not do well at a dog park. We also will not adopt him to multi-family living situations or busy locations, as that will just heighten his fears.\n\nHe loves tennis balls .  His favorite game is picking up ones I roll to toward him and taking them into his area.\n\nHe seems to love all dogs and is wary of humans.  He walks great on a leash and would go for miles.  He loves to cuddle up with me and is very aware of everything going on.  So far he is very quiet.\n\nHe is wary of strange sounds and unexpected movements.  He cowers in a ball and might emit a low growl.  A gentle voice, slow movement, and a bit of eye contact and he let's me comfort him.  He gives kisses and willing licks strangers hands when he are on a walk.\n\nThis dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS? Yes   GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $650\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN. Most of our dogs are strays, so the breed is our best guess.\nWI License #270548.\n \nCheck out Fluffy Dog Wellness on our Home Page. Great Solutions to Enhance Your Pet's Health. www.fluffydog.net",

You can still adopt me, but the cost of the treatment will become your responsibility, ODHS always recommends you contact a vet to price this treatment if you are interested in adopting me beforehand. I am also Ehrlichia positive, which is a tick-borne disease. I will need to be treated with 28 days of doxycycline (an antibiotic).\n\nWho is looking for that sweet girl with the sweetest loving face? I am totally your girl! \n\nI am Maisey! I am 5 years old and 54 lbs! All I have to offer is love! I came here under weight and in need of TLC. Well, I hit the jackpot here. I have gotten such good care that I am already back up to a good weight and looking for my forever loving home. I haven't had a ton of experience in a house so I am learning that now. I have been doing really well! My house manners are getting there quickly. \n\nI don't mind my crate. I am shy at first, but once I see all you want to do is love me that is all it takes. I have 7 dogs in my foster home and I get along with them all. There are also two 9 yr old girls as well and they are great! \n\nI am learning to play with toys and so far enjoying it too. I am still learning better leash manners cause I get a little nervous and will pull. I tend to prefer female caregivers because that is what I am used to.  I have been known to show fear when it comes to interacting with men.\n      \nIf you are looking for a dog with just a sweet, gentle soul, I am your girl!\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.).

(info@pittieloverescue.org) for more information about this pet.\nPittieLove Rescue, Inc. a 501c3 orgainization is an all-volunteer, foster home based rescue.\n\nAdoption Fee: $375\nOur information is current if you are interested please fill out an adoption form here\nhttp://www.pittieloverescue.org/adoption-application\nIt is the easiest way to start the communication and adoption process.Meet Jasper! Let's be honest, this soft and cuddly land seal isn't exactly lacking in the looks department - he is gorgeous! Jasper is a giant love bug who is exceptionally affectionate, and even a bit needy. His perfect family is one who would appreciate this and have lots of time to spend with him. As a young dog, Jasper is curious, playful, and exuberant, with a little energy to burn. An active family who has a fenced-in yard and wants an exercise partner would also be perfect for this stunner.\n\nJasper is an AMAZING pup, who is energetic, fun, friendly, and incredibly smart! He needs someone who is equally amazing and committed to shaping him into the best version of himself. Jasper is a diamond in the rough, but full of potential and the right forever family will be lucky to polish him up. He is young and exuberant, but also incredibly sweet and so excited about EVERYTHING, including training! Like most adolescents, Jasper would thrive in a family who was enthusiastic about continuing to work with him, allowing him to settle into a home, and giving him time to mature a little. He will, in turn, pay them back with love, loyalty, and lots of kisses.\n\nJasper was in the shelter for several months. Some dogs are able to handle that stress, but others, like Jasper, struggle fiercely with the environment. The result? He needs time and consistency to decompress and start to feel safe and secure once again. His perfect family would be committed to helping him be successful, which means give him the time and space he needs to be comfortable in new situations and not putting him in situations he's not ready for. Jasper has a good history of living with a cat, but he may be too excited now based on how stressed he got while in the shelter. He also has a good history playing with dogs, but might be a challenge to manage his training and integrating with another dog currently until he is on more stable ground, so he should be the only dog in the home. But don't worryreceiving all of his love and attention is a full time job. Due to his size and lack of manners currently, older or no kids would be best for this loveable pup.www.pittieloverescue.org\n\nPlease consider a donation so that we may continue the important work we do.\n1/31/21 6:15 PM",

You can still adopt me, but the cost of the treatment will become your responsibility, ODHS always recommends you contact a vet to price this treatment if you are interested in adopting me beforehand.\n\nHi my name is Collette! I\u2019m 4 years old and 32 lbs! \n\nI'm a bit shy. I have what you call fear aggression, it's when I'm cornered and that fight or flight kicks in - I'm gonna fight. I bit one guy on the hand when he took me outside and tried to put me in an outdoor pen and I didn't want to go, so my collar was too loose, so I popped out of it and ran off. Well, he tackled me to the ground and I got super scared so I bit his hand (1/22). \n\nOnce I get home with you, I'm super loving and want all the pets! Don't move too fast though, cuz I get nervous. I am super smart and learned how to use a doggie door right away! If you slowly put a leash on me, I'll go in the crate, although I don't bark, I can be whiney. I'm a curious girl and wanna know what you are doing all the time! \n\nHope to see you soon! \nCollette\n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Welcome to Cocker Nation Rescue of Michigan!\n\nDon't forget to visit our channel at YoutubeI'd like you to meet Roscoe(tricolor) and Henry(sable) 10.5 years old.\nThey are 1/2 brothers and a bonded pair, been together since pups. They will need to be placed together, no exception.\nThey came to Cocker Nation Rescue when their elderly owner could no longer care for them. They are house broken(no accidents). Since I have had them.\nI'll tell you about Roscoe first:\nAgain, he is tricolored. He has recently lost 20 lbs. At his heaviest weight he was 60 lbs. He was diagnosed with thyroid issues and placed on thyroid med and in a matter of months has dropped down to 42 lbs. He gets thyroid meds Am and PM. He has dry eye issues so he gets drops in his eyes 3-4 times a day. He loves to go on walks and is a huge fan of a good message!! He tends to be the leader of the two. No bad habits or vices.\nHenry, sable colored, is a lover boy! As sweet as they come! He has a slight limp from a broken leg as a puppy that required surgery. It doesn't slow him down. He also loves his walks and messages! Roscoe is Henry's security blank... Henry receives a lot of comfort and confidence through Roscoe. Henry is the follower. No bad habits or vices.\nAdded note: Henry can not be crated... his anxiety sky rockets and he could severely hurt himself while crated. Roscoe doesn't mind being crated.\nThey both take an allergy pill once a day which helps with itchy skin.\nIf you think these two beautiful boys could be just what you're looking for we'd love to here from you! They have a lot of love to give. We're not sure of their experience with cats. Their ideal home would offer daily walks, have a fenced yard. Possibly a retired person or a person working from home to give them the attention they deserve.(although they do well when left home alone).\n\nReady to add this duo to your life? Please fill out an application on our website! Or message us for more questions!",

            "description": "Rosie #7596 is a 5-year-old female Labrador mix. Rosie is a shy but sweet lady. Rosie knows the commands: sit, stay and down. Her favorite treats are beef sticks, milk bones, bacon flavor and peanut butter. She walks well on a leash, although she does tend to cower around others. We are seeking an experienced dog owner. She has anxiety which makes her appear scared of other dogs and people. She is currently taking daily medication to help with her anxiety. This may or may not be a lifelong ailment. Due to her timid nature, she should be the only pet in the home. She should also be in a home without children. Rosie is both a flight risk and an escape artist. This means that she needs to be watched closely and always secured, whether that be on a leash outside or in her crate at home. Her perfect fit would be someone who is home most of the time so that she can always have a companion. Ideally, we would like to see her with an owner who is patient and willing to help her to come out of her shell. She weighs 50 pounds and should gain 5 pounds. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Snoopy #7595 is a 8-month-old male Labrador/Hound mix. He is a sweet boy who has lots of puppy energy. Snoopy is crate trained. He knows the commands sit and down. He is treat-motivated and loves all kinds! Currently, he is still using his mouth during playtime and would greatly benefit from professional training. He is very stubborn and will growl when he doesn\u2019t get his way, we are working on that with him.  He absolutely loves running and playing with his toys. His owner should be willing to take the lead and be committed to training so that Snoopy can be the best version of himself. He weighs 43 pounds and should weigh 50 pounds full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities",

I\u2019d love a home where there\u2019s a yard to run in and toys to play with and maybe even some trips to the dog park or hiking trails.   I walk well on a leash, sit on command, am potty trained, get along with kids and other dogs and would be a great new family member to you!  I think cats are fun to chase but they don\u2019t seem to appreciate it so I think my new home should be cat-free. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a \u201cgood dog\u201d, I\u2019m your guy!  to add to your family, IYou can set up a time to meet me by contacting the shelter at 972-382-3647 ext 4 or adoprionsmoh@gmail.com.\n\nOnce vetted I\u2019ll be ready for my forever home.",

            "description": "Chase #6803 is a 4-year-old male German Shepherd mix. Chase is a sweet but protective gentleman. He is both crate and house trained. He knows the commands: sit, down, come, stay and heel. Chase walks great on a leash.  He loves outside playtime and fetch especially. We are seeking an adopter with German Shepherd experience, and the adopter should not be a first time dog owner. Chase is extremely protective of his owner. Otherwise, he is very chill and has a relatively low energy level. He should be the only pet in the home and in a home without children. He prefers women over men. Any introductions to men should be slow and supervised. He weighs 72 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities\n\n",

We are not sure who their fathers are, but all eight puppies are gorgeous!\n \nUmphrey is one of six boys.  He is a playful, sweet puppy.  He and his siblings, Purvis, Qford, and Verge, favor so much it is hard to tell them apart!  He and his siblings have been lovingly cared for from birth and are going to make great family pets.  They are all extremely friendly and have never had a bad day.  They love people and love to romp and play in the grass.  \n\nUmphrey is patiently waiting for his forever home.  He wants a family that will love and care for him always!  \n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and current on all vaccinations. They receive monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

She knows the sit command. She does OK in the crate, but will try to break out of it when left alone. Ensure that the crate is secure before leaving. Joelle is almost 100% house trained. She will go to the door to alert you, but if you don\u2019t let her out in time she will go right by the door. Joelle is an LCAR momma; she came to us with puppies that have since been weaned. She is ready for some R&R and a home of her own. Joelle also came to us with heartworms. We are seeking an adopter that will continue her treatment, provided by LCAR, at no additional cost. She weighs 40 pounds and should gain a few more to reach her ideal weight. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship.

We are not sure who their fathers are, but all eight puppies are gorgeous!\n \nQford is one of six boys.  He is outgoing and full of life.  He and his siblings, Purvis, Umphrey, and Verge, favor so much it is hard to tell them apart!    He and his siblings have been lovingly cared for from birth and are going to make great family pets.  They are all extremely friendly and have never had a bad day.  They love people and love to romp and play in the grass.  \n\nQford is very sweet and he will soon be looking for his forever home.  He wants a family that will love and care for him always!  \n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and current on all vaccinations. They receive monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs.

I\u2019m working on getting all my puppy shots and other vetting done. You can submit an application for me and then wait on the humans to review and email you back.\n\nAs a puppy, I am required to go to training within 90 days of my adoption with a certified trainer. Paws and Heels is recommended. \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays.\nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

I am about 2 years old, male, german shepherd/labrador mix current on vaccinations -rabies, distemper/parvo, dewormed, neutered. \n\nBaron was original found on a side of a road and he was very happy with his family, but their living conditions changed and they can't have him anymore. Baron grew up around children and cat, but he doesn't like other dogs. Given his food protective behavior, Baron would do best in a home without small children.\n\nBaron is just the sweetest dog ever!! He loves to give kisses and He loves walks. Baron is a little shy at first but give him a couple of minutes and he is all loves and wants to play!\n\nAdoption Fee $325\nThis tax-deductible fee pays for the vaccinations, spay/neuter, boarding, food, and overall care of all the animals at the shelter.\n\n(*Includes spay or neuter with HHP vet. If a personal vet is preferred a partial refund will be issued. KEEP ONLY IF NOT FIXED)\n\n**If you're unable to adopt, please consider donating or volunteering your time to these deserving animals currently living at HHP. They require care and love on a daily basis, which adds up monetarily. Our shelter is funded by donations and adoption fees alone. The need is great within our community and your support matters.\n\nIf you have questions, please stop by any day between 1pm-6pm. Contact our office at (406) 896-1700 or Angie (406) 860-8735.",

My foster Dad said I'm a man's dog but I like to cuddly on the couch with foster Mom too. I attended the Christmas Parade and enjoyed meeting the kids, they're my favorite. I've been playing with my foster brother & sister. We have the best time. If you are looking for a fun guy that likes children & fur-kids, I'm your guy. Love Finn\n\n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.teammemphis.org under the Our Rescue page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.",

Very active! \n   \nSCHEDULE & FOOD ROUTINE :\nAM:  1c. quality dry food + \u00bc can of quality wet food\nPM: 1c. quality dry food + \u00bc can of quality wet food\n**\u201cFish Friday\u201d \u2013 replace wet food with a can of sardines (in water) \n+ once a month saut\u00e9ed beef liver ( lunch portion about 3 oz.)\n+ organic yogurt + probiotics weekly\n\nDetails from Danny\u2019s loving foster: This boy is a gorgeous medium size lab/dobie/sharpei/bully mix. Short haired boy, his fur is very soft. DNA test would be interesting!\n\nA VERY active boy with LOTS of \u201cpuppy\u201d energy! Would love a family that can take him on at least 3 walks a day, or be able to run in a fenced in yard, at least 6\u2019, as he can jump!\n\nHe appreciates a variety of indestructible bones & toys, stuffed Kongs, and chewy kong balls, large antlers.  He is potty trained and is used to going out 4x a day for potty breaks. \n\nDanny is a mart and treat driven, I\u2019m sure he would be easy to train for various activities, jobs, & tricks. He can sit, catch bones. He is working on giving up/sharing toys, leash manners & separation anxiety is improving. He patiently waits for his food \nbowl to be put down, we use a \u201cslow feeder\u201d because he used to gobble it down too fast.\n\nCurrent Recommendation: Active home who can walk/run 3-4 times a day, or play in fenced in yard. Only pet, no kids due to activity/strength/manners & not being able to share treasures with other dogs.\nHe is learning quickly to trade his ball/toy for treats, but not likely to share with a dog.",

He has had a hard life though as we rescued him from living on the streets in Houston where he had to fend for himself and fight off other dogs to survive. So he would do best as an only dog in a home without a lot of goings on or new people and loud noises. But everyone here at the rescue has fallen in love with him. He really is a special dog but it's important that he goes to the right home or we will be keeping him at the shelter indefinitely.",

            "description": "Snow is a 2 yo, 40lb, female (spayed), mix breed. NKGC pulled her from our local animal control on November 7th 2020. At the time we pulled her, Snow was completely broken. She had been on a strict \"Bite Quarantine\" for over a month, that is with no human interaction at all. We tried to uncover the details surrounding the incident without success. She spent her days at animal control curled up in a corner trembling in terror. We had a dog trainer/ behaviorist come and evaluate Snow and his evaluation was that she is terrified, depressed, and traumatized. \n\nOnce we took Snow into our care she went to and has been with her loving foster home ever since. We wanted to give Snow a safe place to decompress and learn that humans are not bad. She is now completely vetted and ready for her forever home. \n\nHer foster mom says, \" she has done great with her other dogs and cats. She's fairly energetic and wants to play with the other pets of the house. She does not have much interest in toys. She loves treats and takes them very nicely. She loves getting to play in the back yard and then when she comes back in she loves to take a good nap. She will need a home with a secured fenced in yard. She is not an escape artist, she just loves to be outside and especially in the beginning when I had her she was checking for a place to get out, she doesnt do that anymore. Due to her trauma history and her background in general I think her ideal home would be an active home with another dog that she can play with, a home with no children, and someone who has the patience and is willing to accept Snow on her terms.\"\n\nIf you think you are the right person for Snow, please fill out an adoption application here: https://form.jotform.com/203216945213146",

I had a rough start in life, but I am so happy to have another chance. I was abused when I was little and did not really learn to trust humans. This just made me super sad and scared of everything. But I just knew I was worth so much more. Then a nice human came along and adopted me. I had the best life. I know it wasn't my owners fault, but I had to be rehomed again because he got sick. I just try to remember, no matter what comes to me in life, I know I can always recover from it. I still face everyday challenges with changes. I need slow introductions to humans and time to warm up. But the impact I will have on your life, through trust and love, will be a very special bond. As long as I have my safe space like the crate, I will be happy. When I am not there, I like to explore the backyard, chase balls, and frisbees. I love playing in the water hose, pool, or sprinklers. I am bit of a homebody; new environments are scary to me, especially if there are strangers. I could probably warm up on a hike with just my people, but I don't want to go to soccer practice or brunch. I really struggle making new friends in a new environment, I am best doing this at home in my safe space with no walks. I just really enjoy my own yard with my own people. I do require a fenced yard. This is a must and will also help me to feel safe and allow me to run around and play! I am such a cuddle bug. REALLY smart because I will learn any new trick usually within a day. I am dog friendly but really like smaller dogs, ones that will help me build my confidence around the house. Just make sure you make room on your couch for snuggles, I will even let you pick the movie. Can't wait to meet you!\n\nSimba is only available for adoption in TX.\n\nAll our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing. Height dependent upon the dog.\n\nAll current pets in adoptive home must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdopter must be at least 21 years of age.\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.connectionspetrescue.org",

We are at a foster home and after our spay and neuter we are now ready to find our new forever family. My foster Mommy says i am a good girl, and I could just cuddle all day long. I am a super love bug. Easy going and easy to get along with everyone.\n\nI have been with my brother Zeke for 7 years so my foster Mommy wants to give a chance at a forever family together. Since we are family already.\n\nMy brother Zeke is a sweet dog, full of non stop kisses. My foster Mommy thinks he is a good boy, super smart and learns quickly. He is a cuddler too and full of kisses.\n\nWe get along with all the dogs here at the foster home.\n\nIf you are looking for two dogs please check our video below to see just how cute we are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uE9wM4dL3w\n\nZeke 7 yrs male\nJack russell mix\nneutered, vaccinated, rabies, MC\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog/zeke-video-50232058/ca/pasadena/the-dog-rescuers-ca1860/\n\nNala 7 y chihuahua female\nspayed, teeth cleaning, vaccinations rabies MC\n\nTheDogRescuers@gmail.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uE9wM4dL3w",

We have no info on them, except one of her extended family knew she got them both in California at least 8 years ago.  \n\nThey have been with me for a few months, are fine with my dogs and cat.\nThey are always looking for a lap to sit in. They are very well behaved.\nThey are potty trained, Peanut has recently been neutered, so we are working on not marking in the house. Peanut, the male, is only 2.5#! \n\nWe have spayed/neutered them, given them their distemper, rabies and bordatella vaccinations, they have been heartworm-tested negative and are microchipped.  \n\nTheir adoption fee is $350.  If you are interested in adoption, go to www.centerforanimalrehab.org, click on Applications and fill out the Adoption Application.  Once we review the applications, we will be in touch..\n\nWe are located in Waukesha, WI and do not ship.  Also, our dogs are in foster homes and are not at CARE/Seniors Rock.\n\n",

Still a bit underweight at about 70 pounds, Mater is cratetrained and housetrained. Basic obedience (sit, stay, etc) and leash manners are still a work in progress but he's improving. He sleeps in his crate at night and has been left out for brief period of time unsupervised (2-3 hrs) and hasn't had any accidents or been destructive, although generally he's crated if left home alone.

The bestest day of my life so far was the day I got A NEW LEASH ON LIFE and they took me on a long car ride to my new foster home! They tell me there will be a day even better than that when my new family comes to take me HOME! \n\nIf you are looking for a spunky, senior girl with a little bitta grey, I'm your girl and you will be getting the best years of my life! I am great with the dogs and cats and humans in my foster home. And I love leash walks and car rides and just hanging out inside...it's so nice and comfy in the warmth of my foster home. I have learned the doggie door well. And I look forward to learning all I can about the comforts of a HOME!",

She currently weighs about 53 pounds but would ideally weigh in the 60-65 lb range. She is housetrained but needs supervision in the house because she is a big curious puppy that is still learning what is and what isn't a dog toy. Ygritte does very well with her submissive foster brother and prefers to be in charge; she would thrive as an only dog or with another dog that will let her be the boss. She is food aggressive towards other dogs and needs to be fed separately. Ygritte would love an active family to take her jogging, hiking, or walking and is very affectionate with people. She should have a securely fenced yard since she has a strong prey drive and is determined to catch a squirrel or neighborhood cat.",

Venom is a loving boy and does great with all of the shelter staff. Venom DOES NOT LIKE OTHER DOGS OR CATS so he will need a home where he is the only pet. Venom loves people but does have some energy that will require regular exercise. Venom should do well with kiddos and would be a good snuggle buddy. Venom weighs about 40 pounds and is ready for his new home!!\n\nHis adoption fee is $61.50 and he can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

Stella is approximately 2 years old and weighs about 55 pounds and she's a talker! She has brought so much joy and so many laughs to her foster family!!  She is a sweet, funny girl who has been house-trained, fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped!\n  \nShe loves her walks and does great on leash.  She is good with other dogs, and adores her humans, especially children!   This is a beautiful, intelligent, and fun-loving dog who definitely will become a cherished member of some lucky family!  \n\nIf you think that family should be yours, please complete the online pet adoption application in the upper left portion of the homepage of our website!  www.baytownhumanesociety.org",

This beautiful hound weighs approximately 65 lbs and is reliably housetrained and cratetrained. She loves to go for walks and rides well in a car. June gets along with all of the other dogs in her foster home and loves to play and run. She is very affectionate and loves belly rubs. June is a sweet girl and would do well with older children (young kids could be easily knocked over by her excitement). Cats are unknown. June is waiting in the Dallas area for her forever family.",

We are not sure who their fathers are, but all eight puppies are gorgeous!\n \nPurvis is one of six boys.  He is friendly and playful.  He and his siblings, Qford, Umphrey, and Verge, favor so much it is hard to tell them apart!    He and his siblings have been lovingly cared for from birth and are going to make great family pets.  They are all extremely friendly and have never had a bad day.  They love people and love to romp and play in the grass.  \n\nPurvis will make the perfect companion for a family that will give him lots of love.  He is ready to run and play and take long naps in someone\u2019s lap! \n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and current on all vaccinations. They receive monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

He was a bit too much for his first family to handle and as a result he spent most of the day in his crate. We were able to get him out of that situation and he really is a great little pittie. He loves to romp around and play with people and other dogs. He still needs to be fixed so his play needs to be watched closely to be sure he is not getting to riled up. He gets along with female dogs and retreated when a male dog snarled at him. We aren't sure how is with cats. He would probably be best with older kids and he still jumps and climbs all over people. Fill out your application for Lazlo today!",

A home with another dog and someone home all the time would be best for this girl.  She is positive for Heartworm, Ehrlichia and Lyme disease and has already started her treatment and will need to stay local to Waldorf, MD to continue her treatment. If you are interested in doing a foster to adopt please fill out an adoption application on our website  www.rescueangelssomd.com\n\nAll dogs receive vet care before adoption, including spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, Heartworm/Lyme/Ehrlichia 4DX snap test, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention, and microchip.

She is learning a lot here at the shelter, but  can't wait to find a person to give her some much needed quality time and training. Journey unfortunately is not good with cats and may be to high energy for small children. She seems like she could be good with other dogs, but we don't have any currently that can match her wild side. If you're interested in adopting Journey please call us at 530.623.1370\n\nDue to Covid-19 we are closed to walk-ins please call ahead to schedule an appointment. If you would like more information or would like to inquire about adopting, please call. We do not do online adoptions and we do not often have time to answer questions via Facebook or through Messenger. Please call 530.623.1370",

Tall and weighing in at 74 lbs, she is housetrained, cratetrained, and knows basic commands. Sadie is very people-oriented and doesn't do well with other dogs or cats, and she has never been around small children. She is trained to eat in her kennel and runs to it at feeding time. Sadie is energetic outside and loves to run and play fetch; she will even throw the ball for herself if you take too long! Once she comes inside, she transforms into a couch potato and just hang out with her people. She is the goofiest dog and will never fail to make you laugh. Sadie absolutely loves car rides and sticking her head out of the window. Sadie loves toys but needs the tough ones. Sadie is fine left alone in the house for short periods of time with proper toys, but at her age can't yet be left alone too long or she can be mischievous. She walks well on a leash. She is very expressive and vocal - she sings songs of joy when she sees her people and grunts with displeasure when you want her to move. She loves baths, enjoys swimming, and hiking. She lets you trim her nails with barely any effort.",

            "description": "Thank You DelleBovi Family!\nFlynn Flat Bread was born about October 4, 2014 and weighs about 22 lbs. He is as cute as they come and was released from his puppy making days in a puppy mill in West Virginia. The 'millers' made a call to the humane society and said they no longer needed the services of 29 dogs and would they take them. The shelter is a kill shelter due to space and could not handle so many dogs and so they asked if we would take them. How could we not! So, we squeezed and adjusted and were able to take them all. Sadly, Flynn has failed two adoptions as after a decent length of time they still could not touch him nor would he stay in the same room as them. He is wonderful with the other dogs here and is now considered a Joyful Rescues Sanctuary pet. He can seldom be touched and if he is it is not for long and when we must 'catch' him to be groomed we must use a towel to protect our hands. He does happily live inside the house with the humans who live and work here as long as they are not forcing themselves on him, which we do not unless absolutely necessary such as hair trimming. It is felt Flynn is living his best life right where he is and is a very happy boy. From Dr. Rasnake: There is mild pegmentary keratitis which is likely from hair rubbing on the surface of the eye. This condition may be the result of improper hygiene/grooming. His future family will need to be diligent to keep hair cut short around his eyes so this does not worsen. He still can see, but there is some cloudiness.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

We were told she was 14, but honestly Sammy still acts like a puppy somtimes, so we wonder if she is younger, but thats what we were told, so we will stick with that.\n\nSammy is the cutest, sweetest little girl. She gets along well with other dogs, loves to play with other dogs, and LOVES her toys more than anything. She enjoys snuggling and sleeping on the couch, which is where she spends most of her time. She also loves to drag her blanket around the house to snuggle on it where she wants....it's adorable. We would love to Sammy to go to a home with someone who has lots of time to spend with her, will spoil her rotten, and understands that she is a bit older. Right now she is totally healthy and happy. Sammy is also potty trained and listens very well. She will go to the back door at the fosters home when needing to go potty.\n\nIf you are interested in adding the sweetest older gal to your family, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com",

Right now I probably need some work like obedience as I was left to do my own thing for quite a while. I'm great with humans and older kids as I've lived with them, but I would need appropriate introductions with other dogs, or would prefer to be the only dog as I've only lived with another male GSD. Cats and livestockk are definitley not my thing either. More to come on me as I learn more about myself. I am current vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped and spayed. Minimum adoption donation: $350.00\n\nPlease copy and paste the following link to fill out Lily's Application. \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoptions/personal-information?application_type=Adopt&pet_id=943936",

            "description": "Please say hi to sweet Roo! Roo is a love bug who loves nothing more than to snuggle with her person. She's an older dog, so is calm and easy to be around. Roo loves to go on walks, car rides and where ever you'd like to take her - your perfect day is her perfect day. Well, more accurately, being with you is her perfect day. :-)\n\nBeing an older gal, she's has some \"baggage\" (don't we all): she's not crazy about other dogs (prefers keeping you to herself) and has a kidney condition which can be controlled by diet. Easy peasy.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about Roo, please fill out an application at www.richardsonhumanesociety.com and a counselor will be in touch!\n\nIf you are reading this, we are still accepting applications on this pet. \n\nOur Adoption Process:\n\n\n\tMeet the Adoption Criteria. Before you do anything else, make sure you meet our adoption criteria. You must be at least 21 years old. You must live within a 60-mile radius of Richardson, Texas. You must share veterinary records for all pets currently in your home and all pets owned in the last five years. All pets in the home must be spayed or neutered. If you rent your home, you must provide verification that pets are allowed on the property. You must be willing to be interviewed by an adoption counselor and you must undergo an in person or virtual home visit from an RHS representative.\n\tComplete Application. https://www.richardsonhumanesociety.org/adopt/\n\tPhone Interview. Compatible applicants will be forwarded to a counselor who will contact the applicant for a phone interview.\n\tHome Visit. If all the steps above are completed satisfactorily, we will set up a visit where you can meet the pet you are interested in. We will try to include the foster parent so you can learn more about how the pet is in a home environment.\n\tComplete Adoption. If all feel it is a good match, we will schedule the adoption at your home or an off-site location. The applicant will need to complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies (under 1 year) and $125 for cats. Discounts are available for senior-aged pets.\n\n\nRHS adopts within 60 miles of Richardson, TX.

(1/6) WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/2) \n\nMY STORY: Galena is like a little bear cub. She is really a lot fluffier than she looks in her photos. If I had to pick I would say she is the calmest pup that we have, but pups will be pups, so not sure any of them are that calm. \n\nI did notice today while taking photos that her hear is a bit crooked. Not sure if it is her ears that make her look that way, or the difference in her eyes, but either way it's unique and doesn't affect her one bit.\n\nDogs needing foster homes are available for adoption This dog does need a foster home. Have you ever considered fostering a dog?  For more information, see the Fluffy dog rescue home page. This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?

He's a flirt with all of our staff members and loves nothing more than to be with his people. His ears stand straight up on his head and he is so speedy! He looks like a big intimidating dog, but he's only about 50 pounds and he's full of nothing but love.\n\nTJ needs to be an only pet in a house with no dogs or cats. We think he would do well with older kids! He just doesn't know his own strength, bless his heart. TJ's 4 years old. His adoption fee is $195, and he is neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested and current on all vaccines.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

            "description": "Name: Hyacinth\nSuspected Breed(s): Beagle\nGender: Female\nAge: ~1 year old\nWeight: 20 lbs\nPersonality: Goofy, energetic, a snuggler, smart, funny, shy, quiet, affectionate, a quick learner, loyal, gentle, adaptable, eager to please, and playful. \nObservations with Dogs: Good with other dogs. \nObservations with Cats: Unknown\nObservations with Kids: Afraid of children.\nHouse Training Progress: In progress she still has very puppy-ish manners. \nCrate Training Progress: Hyacinth enjoys the crate!\nRescued From: Columbus County, NC\nAdditional Information: Hyacinth is one of the most adorable and goofy pups you will ever meet! She's a good-natured snuggler who is spunky and up for anything. Hyacinth is a big fan of playing with other dogs at the dog park and zooming around. She is still learning what is and is not a toy to chew on, but its hard to be upset, as she is so funny and entertaining. Hyacinth loves to curl up on the couch with her person, though she is working on feeling comfortable with men. She is a wonderful girl in search of an adopter who will patiently train her and give her the love she deserves.\n\nHyacinth and Haylin are sisters, but we do no adopt siblings together. \n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster-based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nMenna is a happy wiggle butt girl who loves to go for walks and hang with humans.  She is affectionate and just a bit of a goof ball.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

NO APARTMENTS, HOMES IN BIG CITIES, ETC.\n\nHe is dog-friendly but takes a little more time to warm up to people. Very loving once he likes you, and will want to be with you all of the time. We are trying to find a home where Beeper will not have to be left alone for long periods of time. Beeper needs a home with someone who has a lot of cattle dog experience!\n\nFoster notes: Beeper is such a sweetheart! He's smart and easy-going, is house trained and learned to use the dog door right away. He's playful and fun and also a mellow and cuddly companion once he trusts you. Beeper loves treats and toys and puts up with his feisty foster sister. He's a quick study and will learn new tricks easily. He's an absolute joy as long as you are the only one in the home!",

He prefers women over men and would need slow introductions when meeting men.  He will be protective over his humans. He can be stubborn when he wants his way so an experienced handler would suit him best.  He will need to continue his training...and he can be an escape artist if given the chance.

My previous home had a major life adjustment occurring and they were no longer able to care for me, so I am now residing at Lucy Mackenzie for the time being. It\u2019s an interesting change, to say the least, but I\u2019m adjusting very well. I\u2019m making friends with the wonderful staff here and going for walks with them is one of my favorite activities, especially after the beautiful snow falls. I might be a little on the older side, but I still have a lot of pep in my step, so don\u2019t let my age fool you! My one wish is that my forever home is just around the corner, and is a loving, quiet refuge to spend my golden years basking in attention. If you\u2019ve been looking for a sweet canine companion to fill your days with love, please call to learn more about me!",

            "description": "Thank You Barker Family!Pepper was born about May 15, 2015 and weighs about 50 lbs. She is a Joyful Rescues sanctuary pet because she arrived from the southern high kill shelter extremely fearful of humans, but she is wonderful with all the other dogs here. Pepper never found a home because she has a very fast bite response to any human that moves too fast around her or in any situation where she feels uncertain what the human may do - even to reach out and pet her. Every one here understands this and new humans in the house are told ahead of entering not to reach out to Pepper. With this understanding of her behavior she has been living here and will continue to live here happily. She enjoys the activity and the acreage playing with the other dogs and is welcome to stay as long as she lives.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

His owner did the right thing and signed him into us. This poor boy has had little to no proper training. Due to this he does not like to share his food with anyone and knows very few commands. He does know sit and overall walks nicely on a leash. He also has not been properly socialized with other dogs. On top of that he has problems with both of his hips and his knees. He needs a very special person or rescue to step up and to help him. If you are interested and you email us we will be happy to discuss what is actually going on with him. He is a sweet boy and really just wants someone to love him the way he deserves. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting him please email us at animalshelter@islipny.gov. If you are a 501c3 rescue interested in pulling him, when you email us please include your 501c3 paperwork with the email.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Kenny wound up in a shelter late in 2020 because of an unfortunate incident. One day, the person who found him (and maybe was planning to keep him; we don't know) was walking him when Kenny tripped the finder, who fell on Kenny. Kenny responded with a couple of bites to the finder's forearm, drawing blood. The finder decided they didn't want Kenny and took him to the shelter. There, he turned out to be a good boy, loving other dogs and doing well with the people who handled him. But, because of the bite, only a rescue could get him out of the shelter.\n\nSo we did. He spent a little time in a foster, but because they were so far away from us, we brought him to our board and train. We learned while he was with the foster that Kenny likely was an outdoor dog, as he at first seemed uncomfortable inside the home. He also exhibited the excitement when walking that likely caused his finder to trip. Fortunately, our foster was aware of the incident and was cautious when walking him. We also learned that Kenny LOVES other dogs and wants to meet everyone he sees.\n\nKenny will need a home with an experienced dog owner who can help him learn to trust -- he is getting better and better with that, but is still somewhat leery -- and let him get comfortable on his terms. He's overall a sweet young dog we believe can lead a nice, happy life in the right home.",

I don't think he's ever met a dog, cat, or person that he doesn't like!\n\nHe absolutely loves treats and toys, too!\n\nHe is a bouncy dog who hasn't quite mastered manners in the art of dog play. Although he LOVES other dogs, sometimes they get annoyed with him because he doesn't know when to stop playing. He would love a forever home that can dedicate time and energy to training him.\n\nI'm sure he would LOVE children too, but his bouncy body and playfulness might be too much for young children or children who aren't used to that kind of dog behavior.",

She is living in a foster home waiting for her forever family.\n\nBetsy is one of the most happy, go lucky dogs in our home. She has played the companion dog to many of her foster brothers and sisters. She is our go to girl when introducing majority of the dogs, especially ones that are scared & uncertain. We believe Retriever can be found in Betsy's DNA because she loves water. She jumps in and out of the kiddie pool sometimes emerging her face in the water. She loves running and playing. \n\nBetsy is a special needs dog. Due to digestive problems, her preferred food is Pro Plan EN. We like to think of it as special food for a special girl.\n\n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.teammemphis.org under the Our Rescue page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.",

She is in need of a very special adopter because  she was born with a birth defect affecting her heart,  and it cannot be repaired with surgery.  We at Humane Tomorrow think she deserves to still find her forever home with an adopter who understands her condition will not improve but can be maintained with inexpensive medication. Due to this condition, she needs a home with a quiet, laid-back environment.  Candy likes other dogs, but she will do best as an only dog to help reduce her activity level. Candy is also good with kids, but all children in the home need to understand that she should not participate in activities like chasing a ball, running around the yard or activities where she overexerts herself.  She can still do lots of normal dog activities like snuggling with her people, learning new tricks, chewing on bones and toys and taking short leisurely walks.  With proper care and an enriching, loving environment, Candy could be a great companion for the right adopter.",

We aren\u2019t sure what his past was, but what we\u2019ve come to know of Knubs is he\u2019s a very sweet, couch snoozing, dog friendly Great Dane. He needs a home with older kiddos (he doesn\u2019t enjoy being bumped and stepped on) and really just wants to spend his days cuddling on the sofa enjoying intermittent naps, passing gas, and snacking on chips. Knubs is 6 years old, in foster in Johnstown, and weighs approx 110 lbs. His adoption fee is $350. REQUIREMENTS: 1. Couch privileges 2. Kids 10+.

I have had some ups and downs lately but I'm keeping my chin up because who wants to be around a dog who is pouting. Not me, and probably not you either. Oh, you want to know what happened? Well, it's kind of a long story so I'll just give you the Cliff's Notes. \n\nI had a great owner. We loved each other immensely. Our bond was strong. Then he passed away and I was homeless. His son took me in, but after we lived together for awhile, his son decided that it caused him pain to take care of me because it made him think about his dad all the time. So his son brought me to the City Shelter. I guess I thought it might be a good thing to have a remembrance for someone you lost, but not for that guy. \n\nHis loss. I'm a great dog! I love with my full heart. I like to have fun and I am a loyal companion. I'm feeling a little wonky from all of the transitions and loss I've had to endure, but now I'm here at Desert Haven and I am starting to feel stable and secure again. I am now ready to try again to find the next Love of My Life and if you are also ready, we should meet. See you soon! Love, Thor\n\n(Thor is around 60 pounds)",

            "description": "Memphis\n\nMemphis is a 1-2 year old hound mix who came to us in November from a county shelter in, you guessed it, Memphis. Unbeknownst to us, Memphis was emaciated at 25 pounds (we thought he was a \u2018mini hound\u2019) and had a broken pelvis. With crate rest and proper nourishment, Memphis is now a healthy, curious and playful young hound. Memphis does very well with other dogs. Memphis has not been around cats or children. \nLike any young hound, Memphis will need ample attention and stimulation. Memphis has not been able to go for walks as crate rest was required to heal his broken pelvis. Memphis loves chew toys and tolerates his crate. Memphis would prefer an adopter who is home most of the time so that he can get ample love, play, attention, and exercise. \nMemphis will be available mid January once he recovers from his neuter surgery. Memphis can look a little grumpy due to his under bite - but he\u2019s the least grumpy hound boy you\u2019ve ever met! Memphis\u2019s adoption fee is $275. If you are interested in Memphis please fill out an application at https://soazbeaglerescue.com or contact us with any questions.\n\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is a minimum $275.00 donation to help us save more dogs. Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue, SoAZBR is an all-volunteer group. One hundred percent of your donation is used for the care and treatment needy beagles. Your donation is 100% tax deductible, too.\n\nWe URGENTLY need fosters so we can help save more dogs.  If you can help, please contact us.\n\nSouthern Arizona Beagle Rescue Contact Info:\nE-Mail Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue adoption@soazbeaglerescue.com\nSee more of our adoptable at Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue web site http://www.soazbeaglerescue.com \nPhone us at (520) 247-7720",

I was surrendered to the shelter because I was playing too rough with the other dog in the household, so I\u2019m now looking for my forever home! I am almost 4 years old, house trained, leash trained, and know basic obedience. I am SUPER friendly and always smiling! I do get along with some other dogs but they need to be able to handle my energy level. I am very bouncy and strong so I might be best in a home without young children because I don\u2019t want to accidentally knock them over. I would love to have an active family that can provide me with the exercise I need. If interested in meeting me, please contact the shelter at (817)230-0460. If there is another dog in the household, it is a requirement to bring them along for a meet and greet!",

            "description": "#121407Age: 8 years, 7 months Weight: 71 lbs How this pet arrived: This pet was brought in by a Good Samaritan on December 26, 2020. At SDHS:Chico has been microchipped, neutered, and is up to date on vaccinations. Now he's ready for his new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Chico! This handsome fellow is looking for a home that will make him part of the family. Chico really enjoys getting attention from his favorite people--he'll sit right next to you and let you pet him all day long. Chico pulls a little too hard on a leash, so he would benefit from a lot of positive reinforcement. It's been reported that Chico is very housebroken and loves going outside to sniff the surroundings and enjoy the sunlight. He is a fan of high value treats- Chico won't say no to cheese or hot dogs :) This precious gentleman would prefer to be the only dog in the house and get all your attention. Does he seem like the dog for you? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started! Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 71.1875lbs Age: 8yrs 8mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

They're healthy -- both just had dental cleanings -- and adorable. Snowbear has the short hair; Tiger's is longer. Their owner told the shelter they are American eskimo mixes. We aren't sure what mix(es) they are, but they sure are cuties!\n\nThey wound up at a shelter because their owner was evicted from their home. We couldn't say no to those sweet faces who had little to no chance of getting out alive, and when we told the shelter we wanted both they jumped at the chance, and they were out!\n\nSnowbear and Tiger have plenty of pep, but they aren't going to run you ragged. They're happy to lounge and nap on a soft dog bed with one another as company. If you have it in your heart to open yourself to a couple of older gentlemen, ask to meet these two.",

            "description": "Blu is 5 years old, neutered, male Brittany with roan/white markings and, if I do say so myself, he is one very handsome lad! Both Blu and his mom Belle were saved from a bad situation that has left fearful impression on them. Both Blu and his mom Belle must be adopted together. He tries to stay away from the male people, and will often hide behind the skirts of the female humans to keep hidden from view. He is very scared when it comes to humans, but has a heart of gold and gets along very well with other dogs. Blu has not had any formal training, however he is quite accomplished at hunting squirrels and chipmunks, oh, and those house squirrels (cats) are one of my favorite things to chase! ! Blu loves to take walks with his Mom Belle, but he finds leashes a bit restraining, and whatever you do, don't allow Blue to get near an open door or gate! He wasn't named \"Runaway Blu\" at the kennel for nothing. Blu love car rides, and loads well and is quite well behaved in the car. He would do best in a home where there is a person home most of the day.\n\nFoster parents: Blu is coming along with getting socialized, but still prefers solitude to being part of the family. He knows his name, but is still not quite ready to come when called, so some gentle encouragement is needed to bring him in. Blu runs and hides in another room, preferring to be out of sight. He often sleeps in the crate even though the door is always left open. Neither dog has had any sort of basic training, sit, lay, etc., and their fear of people makes this tough to work on, as they think they are being scolded. A home with no other dogs and definitely no cats is preferred, as both dogs team up to hunt smaller animals like cats and squirrels, etc. Both dogs are very gentle around children, and have shown zero signs of aggression to anyone.\n\nBlu will need a physically fenced yard to help keep him active and safe! He is up to date on all vetting, including vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped. Blu and Belle are a bonded pair and as such MUST be adopted together. You MUST have a fenced in yard with lots of room to run.\n\nIf you think you might want to adopt both Blu and Belle, please consider filling out an application online at: https://nbran.org/adopt/adoption-application. After filing out an application please contact the coordinator for the State in which you reside. The contact information for the State Coordinators can be found at the following link: http://www.nbran.org/contacts.asp. Blu's adoption fee is $350.00 which will help NBRAN cover the vetting costs and other expenses associated with bringing Britts like Blu back to good health and readying them for adoption. Don't live in Michigan or close by, No Problem! NBRAN also has a wonderful transport team who will help bring Blu to his new family, up to 1400 miles with the adoptive family being responsible for the last 100 miles, at no additional fee. If you would like more information about Blue please email Georgene Norris at georgenenbran@yahoo.com Thank you!",

We were saved from a bad situation that has left fearful impressions on both Blu and me. Although I am still a bit shy around female people, I just adore my male persons, and follow them everywhere. Well, that is unless there are squirrels around, then all bets are off! I am quite happy with the company I have, and am sort of territorial. While I've not had any formal training, I have to say that I am quite accomplished at hunting squirrels and chipmunks, oh, and those house squirrels (cats) are one of my favorite things to chase!\n\nI love to run, so I'll need a nice physically fenced in yard to romp and play in, and if there are squirrels, BONUS!

The only furniture she's jumped on is our bed, where she's welcome to rest and sleep at night. She loves her walks and does her excited bounce whenever she sees her harness or leash in someone's hands. She hasn't had one accident in the house and has been wonderful about doing her business in the backyard. Our family is a big one, we have kids from 17 to 2 years old and she's been wonderful with all of them.",

            "description": "Creek is an extremely sweet boy. About 4 years old. He is young and loves to let out his youthful energy on walks. He is leash trained and knows a few other commands such as sit. He would need a large, secure yard with high fencing and plenty of room to have fun.\nHe is not yet available to be taken home because he needs to receive his boosters. But in the meantime you may come visit.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

I am a 2yr old Cattle dog mix, I weigh 55lbs, I was neutered, chipped and vaccinated on 12/13-2020. \n\nI am in need of a forever loving person or family who has a big yard or land, can spend lots of time with me daily (not kennel me all day or leave me in a backyard while they are gone long hours). I love to go for rides in any kind of vehicle this is my favorite thing to do! \n\nMy new people would need to be able to train me or afford a trainer to learn with me as I am Deaf and need a little help. But I am extremely intelligent and I've picked up on hand signals really quickly! I know the \"look at me\" hand signal and will sit when I see it, I know both thumbs down to lay down, two jerks of the leash to come (but I have a hard time concentrating when animals are too close or people I am unsure of and I'm a little stubborn when my eyes are dead locked on something) foster mom shortens the leash when I do this and gets in front of me to maneuver me to go a different way as I am still learning. \n\nWe don't know about cats as foster mom hasn't seen me around any in a home environment. I love to play with my foster mom's, nephew's juvenile pit and the little monster even tries to punk me and bite my face but it is funny to me!. I am protective like most all cattle dogs but I do love people if they love me. I could probably even be a working cattle dog with some training. I hear other deaf cattle dogs do! I love to sleep with you and will be your shadow wherever you go! \n\nIs there a special family or person out there just looking for someone like me? Let my foster mom know she is picky and wants me to have the best life I could ever ask for! *Small rehoming fee of $75* FOSTER MOM WILL TAKE ME BACK IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT!! Not for unstable living conditions where I would be left behind, dumped or sent to a shelter! Only stable, responsible people need apply.\n\nFor more info contact 409-440-6791 or dh722646@gmail.com.",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

This combination makes playing with me a lot of fun! I love to play fetch the most. When you squeak a toy to get my attention, the game is on! Here's how the game is best played: I sit nicely while waiting for you to throw the toy for me. You throw it and I very happily chase it down. Then I bring it right back to your feet and sit nicely again. Repeat as often as you like, because I love this game! \n\nWhat I love more than playing is having kind people in my life. I've had some not-kind people in my life before I arrived at Desert Haven and guess what!? Those not-kind people didn't feed me. It was awful and I am not at my healthy weight because of the mean behavior from those not-kind people. However. And this part is very important. The most important thing you should know about me is this: I am resilient! I don't dwell on it. It's behind me, and I'm the sort of chap that looks ahead! \n\nI am looking to the bright future I have ahead of me. I have my good energy, my happy personality, my love of people, and I have a great heart. My future looks bright and all it is missing is my new family to care for me, play with me, and want me. In return for kindness and love and family and home, I will give my people a deeper love that is beyond their wildest dreams. That's what resilient dogs do. Love, Kelly\n\n(Kelly is around 12 pounds)",

He loves to play with our volunteers and with our other doggie buddies.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She is not hyper at all and neither are the pups. We have NO CLUE who dad is. If you are interested in one of Cocos sweet babies please fill.out the application at SGER.PETFINDER.COM and then email me at Sgequinerescue@gmail.com to let me know its done and which puppy. We list lots of puppies as they come in as fast as they leave so subscribe for pupdates.

            "description": "We're not sure why someone would wrap a little chihuahua mix in a blanket and leave him outside a recreation center in Philadelphia but that's how Benji came to us. Fortunately he was found the next morning, shivering and cold, by a kind and caring soul who brought him inside to warm up. She contacted one of our volunteers to ask for some help. There has been no luck in finding his owner. \nOur volunteer took him to a vet and had him checked out. Poor guy had fleas, a skin issue from the fleas, and was so skinny. He was treated for the fleas and has been on an oral steroid since that visit (decreasing doses) and his skin is improving. He has gained a couple pounds and when his steroid treatment is done, he will be neutered. The vet estimated him to be about 7 years old. We thought Benji was a little grumpy initially but it turns out he just takes a couple days to warm up to people! With some love and kindness this boy's personality is shining through!\nBenji is super sweet, cuddly, loves cats, is dog friendly, and is such a good boy! The vet estimates he is about 7 years old. He is working on his housebreaking and is about 90% there and some of that may be related to the prednisone he is on for his skin.\nBenji is up to date on his vaccines, and Lucky Dawg will have him neutered when he is off the prednisone. If you\u2019re looking for a small dog please consider Benji! Please go to www.luckydawganimalrescue.com for an application.\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Hera. I\u2019m estimated to be 2 years old. I am female Labrador and great pyranese mix.  I\u2019m a big girl at 53 pounds, and I LOVE to play, run, and go walking. I\u2019ve been getting along with all the other dogs at my foster moms house but I don\u2019t seem to like cats much, I bark at them a lot so I\u2019d be beat in a home without cats.  I was an owner surrender to a kill shelter in Louisiana.  We don\u2019t know why my owners left me there because I love all the people I come in contact with and I love belly rubs and affection.  I would love to go on walks and hikes.  \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.

Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors.

We can do fun stuff together! My little legs might be little but my zest for life is big!\n\nIf you're ready to meet the little bundle of joy that is going to steal your heart, let's meet!

My ID number is 336121\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Sadie! Sweet Sadie came to live at the Shelter when her people moved and could not take her with them. Poor girl, was confused about the sudden change in her living environment. Sadie is adjusting and making good progress! She is currently working on her leash skills and trusting people that come to meet her. Sadie enjoyed her human siblings, in her former home; she was playful and gentle with them. Sadie likes to be brushed and cuddle with her people! She is friendly, does well with bathing and really looks forward to being apart of a home life, once again!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336533 (male), and 335976 (female). She was in heat at time of eval. excited and vocal with both dogs, but not in an aggressive manner. Was more interested in male than female.\nShe is a big, strong girl. Does not appear that she has had much training on a leash. does know commands sit and shake 1/8/2021\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.

There's no way this poor girl's story would end with her dying at a shelter.  So, WE NEED YOUR HELP!  Squishy is 44 lbs, already spayed and vaccinated.  She is VERY SWEET. She would do awesome in any home.   \n\nSquishy is going to our vet today.  We need a home she can go to after this to rest and recover.  Please foster Squishy.  The Mylo Foundation  will provide all her vet care, a kennel and anything else she may need.  \n\nTo apply: jotform.us/gcurgents/mylo \n\nYOU will make such a difference for this sweet dog.

I meet people in a happy way because I'm a confident boy. I think I have a lot of options for types of homes that I will succeed in, including a home with children and even cats. \n\nI enjoy my dog friends too. I'm just an all-around Great Dog! I enjoy life, love, affection, friends, and being with you. Picture it now, the two of us, snuggling up together on the sofa. Me, listening to you share a story with me. You, looking lovingly into my eyes. Us, becoming best friends.\n\nAre you in search of your new Best Friend? Wow, that is a wonderful coincidence because so am I! Let's meet so we can confirm our mutual admiration. See you soon! Love, Denver",

He can't help but break out in wiggles when he greets you and will get the zoomies when he's really excited. He is a lover and all he wants is to rest his head on you while you give him all the pets in the world. Don't get discouraged by his older age, he still has a ton of energy and a lot of pep in his step. He's also perfectly content snuggling on the couch with you and getting lots of chin and ear scratches. Call today to meet Comet!",

She will sit for a treat and takes them very gently.  Loads right up for a car rides.\nPooch will need to be an only dog, she's a bit of a diva girl but that's ok.  Due to being part heeler cats are probably not a good idea.  She will be so much fun to play with in the yard or curl up and watch a movie with.  The vet says she is a little bit overweight, but she is sensitive about it so we don't talk about it, but she loves walking on a leash, sniffing all the interesting smells so walks would be lots of fun. Pooch will make someone  a great best friend. She is located in St. Louis, , Mo. her adoption fee is $150. Apply at www.wonderweimsrescue.com.\n\nTo find out more please fill out an application at www.wonderweimsrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/. To speak with the foster or visit the adoptable pet you must have an approved application on file.   Once you fill out an application a volunteer will contact you to get you approved.

I am eager for your affection, but I do tend to be patient for your attention. Let me explain. \n\nHere at Desert Haven, I live with two other small dogs and one of them is what you might call an \"attention hog\". Truth be told, that's just not my style. I prefer to sort of wait in the wings for all my lovins from you. I am a sweet, gentle, and patient girl.\n\nBut then when it is my turn for your sweet petting oh boy am I ever happy! I'll give you sweet kisses, you can hold me, and I might even sit in your lap if you let me. You just need to give me a little of your time to warm up and then you'll get to experience all of the goodness and happiness I will bring to your life. Sound good? Great! Let's meet soon, then. Love you, Jingles\n\n(Jingles is about 15 pounds and may be around 2 years old.)",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nPogo is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~6 years\nWeight: ~10lbs\nHousebroken: Needs to be on a strict schedule of about every 2-3 hours\nCrate trained: Hasn't been crated, but has done well with a sectioned area when his foster is away\nDog sociability: Friendly! Lives with many dogs in his foster home and has been doing well. \nCat sociability: Friendly! Lives with a cat in his foster home and has been doing well.\nKids: Unknown, but may do well with older kids/teenagers\nIdeal home: A calm home that can continue to care for Pogo's ongoing medical needs (listed below). He'd love a home with easy access to outside for potty breaks and thick walls as he can be barky.\n\nSSBC (Single Senior Black Chihuahua) looking for love and home cooked meals - meet Pogo! He enjoys longs naps, short walks, cuddling under the blankets, sharing his opinions and making sure he is heard. Dislikes cold weather, the hallmark channel, when dinner is served late, losing at bingo, and cilantro- ick! Pogo is a very good boy and does best when on a strict schedule for potty and eating. Trust us - he knows when it is time to eat! He will not miss a meal if he has anything to say about it (bork! bork!) He sleeps for most of the day. Wears a diaper to avoid accidents in the house but really the accidents are unavoidable because he can't help it as a senior guy. It takes him a little while to fully warm up to his person. He doesn't like being picked up by people he doesn't know. \n\nPogo's adoption fee is sponsored thanks to a generous donor! He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Pogo has heart disease and will take Pimobendan lifelong. Recommend annual monitoring with regular vet and/or cardiologist as needed. Pogo has elevated liver values - he has a history of elevated liver enzymes, and has had an ultrasound to evaluate his liver. He takes Denamarin and Ursodiol to assist with liver function and should remain on this lifelong, and will need annual bloodwork monitoring with his vet, or as recommended. Pogo is a senior dog and may have additional underlying medical issues or needs that have not yet been diagnosed. All senior dogs are recommended to receive biannual wellness visits with your veterinarian to monitor for any changes to their health. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "APPLY ON OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION AT LEADRESCUE.ORG. WE DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF STATE. WE ONLY ADOPT WITHIN ILLINOIS AND WITHIN 50 MILES OF DOWNTOWN CHICAGO.\n\nUpdate: needs to be an only dog. Still needs a home with a secured 6 foot fence. Older children fine.\n\n******************************************\n\nI don\u2019t want to give my dog up. But I don\u2019t have a choice anymore.\n\nLook at your dog. Imagine a time when there wasn\u2019t that dog in your life. Can\u2019t do it, right? It\u2019s okay if you have tears streaming down your face as early as 10am. They are happy tears.\n\nBut for some families, they have to imagine their life without their beloved companion. Their tears are no longer happy. Their tears tell us how much this dog is loved and how much it hurts with this decision. Although LEAD takes in a lot of owner surrenders, we honestly feel bad when we get messaged about one because it means someone is about to do something they never expected.\u00a0\nArcher has a beautiful life with his family. Originally found as a 13 week old puppy thrown out of a car on their family\u2019s farm in Georgia, his family raised him from that day until now, 2 years later. He does phenomenal with dogs both large and small, fine with cats, loves his belly rubbed but definitely too serious of a dog for any face licks, playful, housebroken, and is a very friendly, headstrong boy. So where\u2019s the need to rehome?\n\nWithout getting into too much detail about the family\u2019s situation, Archer would do better in a home with older or no kids. He does not realize his 120 lb Great Pyrenees/Retriever frame and being that he is still young and boisterous, it\u2019s just something this family home life can not accommodate anymore. With the family\u2019s young kids, he can get kinda growly and separating them all day, everyday is causing multiple meltdowns and breakdowns. It\u2019s not healthy for anyone\u2019s mental health. They tried behavioral training, medications, even was able to fundraise $2,000 for board and train-the facility gave them even a 3rd week on them because they could see his potential. So don\u2019t knock the family who is doing what is best for them and Archer by going through a rescue to find a more suitable home.\n\nArcher is a good dog. If you know anything about Great Pyrs, they are probably one of the sweetest gentle giants but they can be very wary of strangers approaching your home. They bark A LOT. They bark when you don't want them to. They bark when they feel the urge. But they bark out of protection. Archer will legit plow through your window if his warning bark is not enough (he hasn't but you catch my drift). Even if the person is like across the street, nowhere near its family, the GP will keep an eye on that person and stay alert until that person is far, far away. This personality trait goes along with them being very bullheaded, so an adopter should be assertive, tolerant, and a little bit bullheaded as well. That being said, he would do best in a neighborhood with not too much commotion and with neighbors who enjoy having a dog on duty all the time. He can pretty much thrive in most types of households though consisting of older well behaved kids or no kids, a friendly pooch or two to hang out with, someone who wants to share an active, fun, but quiet lifestyle. He will roll over on his back after he is done greeting you at the door, hence the upside down photos for show. However he still needs work on not jumping on you when excited. I mean he will literally go through your legs while standing so you might be airlifted onto a pony not by your choice. And per request of his original owner, Archer must have a 6 foot fully fenced yard (the more land, the better) and no to the apartment life. No tie outs. No half-a** fence jobs. No living on the 38th floor. Do not, I repeat, apply if you are in this category.\n\nThere really is a lot to this dog, but I am cramming what I can so you get an overall idea of who Archer is. In the end, even though Archer will no longer get to reside with his original family, he will find joy with someone new. And we hope to keep his family smiling by sending them updates throughout the years of Archer's new life.\n\nOh shoot, one last thing. Archer's girlfriend is a garbage can. He humps that daily. I knew I was forgetting to mention something that could win people over. If interested in the world's greatest goofball and stubborn AF dog, please apply for Archer at leadrescue.org.",

She also enjoys cuddling on the sofa or when you are going to bed. Gretchen lives with other dogs and has fit in well. She knows a few commands and walks well on leash with tail wagging. She loves to play fetch and will even sometimes bring the ball back! Gretchen seems to want to chase cats, so we recommend a cat-free home.\n\nGretchen is about 5 years old and has a long tail. She is a big gal, weighing in at about 60 lbs. She\u2019s spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. She tested negative for heartworms and is taking heartworm prevention. \n\nThanks for considering a dog from Texas Cattle Dog Rescue! We place heelers all over the state of Texas.\n\nIf you're interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application. You can download it at www.texascattledogrescue.com/adopt.html. Our standard adoption fee is $250 +tax for adult dogs, $300 +tax for puppies. Our dogs will be spayed or neutered, vaccinated and heartworm tested before going to a new home. We conduct a home visit to help match up the right dog with the right owner. For more information, visit our website www.texascattledogrescue.com.  Email adopt@texascattledogrescue.com if you have questions.",

            "description": "Dino is a handsome, Lab/Pit mix male that lived outside his whole life and fortunately was discovered by an animal advocate. The Advocate stepped up to help Dino and his owner. He tested positive for heartworms, was treated, and now is heartworm negative. His owner did not want to give him up so the Advocate and animal lover asked the owner if she could hang out with Dino from time to time and give him baths. That lasted a whole year and then the owner was diagnosed with cancer and was willing to re-home Dino with the help of the Advocate who had been visiting for a year. This sweet boy recently had surgery on his back (can be seen in the image) to remove 7 growths that were all benign. He also had 14 teeth removed due to multiple tooth fractures. He still has half of his teeth and he is still able to use them to eat hard food. Dino was raised as a guard dog but he is a big softy about everything in life. He is shy for the first 10 seconds he meets you, but then he will be your best friend. Dino would do best in a home with other dogs that like to play. He is also good with children. He LOVES cuddling and wrestling on the floor with his human. He is house trained and can be left out by himself and is also crate trained.....but don't close the door. Dino craves lots of attention AND he also loves his nap time. He will be your companion and best friend. He has lived outside his whole life and now he is living inside and deserves a human that loves him enough to give him a warm cozy home to call his own. Dino is in Tennessee and can be transported northward or he can be adopted locally to Nashville area. If you are interested please email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

WE ONLY ADOPT IN ILLINOIS AND WITHIN 50 MILES OF DOWNTOWN CHICAGO.\n\nAlthough my son has 4 built in dogs since birth, I hope he loves dogs and wants to take care of them as much as his mom does. And if not, well it\u2019s not like my husband helped that much with them anyways. #boysgottagrowintomensomeday\n\nEmilio and Sasha were posted on a veterinary office\u2019s FB page because their family wanted a better life for them. The parent worked a lot of long hours and her family was not taking on enough responsibility for these two dogs while she was gone. It is a bummer that the person who is making sure there is bread on the table, had to go this direction. She 1,000% loved her babies.\nLEAD was tagged and in 5 minutes, we were on our way to getting 2 more LEADers. I work kinda fast.\n\nAs you gaze upon their pictures, I want to thoroughly get this across: they are BONDED. Emilio the 4 year old, 80 lb Border Collie Lab adores his Sasha, the 9 year old, 12 lb Yorkiepoo and there is absolutely no way we could divorce them. Emilio is protective of shy Sasha when meeting other dogs to make sure no other dog gets with his woman. Sasha will even start barking to instigate and it gets the big bro all riled up. But otherwise, still friendly after the excitement dies down. They also both enjoy play fighting and we know Emilio let\u2019s his lil sista win. When Sasha wants to cuddle with people, Emilio says don\u2019t forget about me too! So one hand per dog is just not enough. One lap isn\u2019t enough. Might have to break out those feet to work double time.\n\nEmilio needs to be on a specific diet (he is on Hills from the vet) as he is allergic to rice, oats, soybean, peanuts, beef, eggs, and green peas. At this rate almost seems like cooking him some human food would be the only type of treats to reward him with. He is overweight a bit even with all those restrictions, so diets don\u2019t necessarily work! He is also allergic to cats and dust. So no cats obvi and clean your house for Emilio\u2019s sake, even under the dreaded couch. Hey I found an entire CostCo sized bottle of Aleve my husband lost under ours. Emilio might be on to something, helping husbands to not be blamed for everything. Sasha can eat anything, thank goodness. Bonded and is allergic to everything? Lol you guys, well Emilio, are too much.\n\nEven though these pooches lost their home, at least they have each other to get through this. It wasn\u2019t like one dog got to stay and the other got the boot. I could see the many reasons why Emilio would meet the boot, however. We need that special someone who is ready for both. Perhaps grateful children who have been dying for a dog and would wash their dishes and eat the broccoli, for their chance at owning 2 furry babies. So if interested in an allergy prone, protective, chunky big brother and a dog named Sasha, please apply at leadrescue.org!",

He is overweight a bit even with all those restrictions, so diets don\u2019t necessarily work! He is also allergic to cats and dust. So no cats obvi and clean your house for Emilio\u2019s sake, even under the dreaded couch. Hey I found an entire CostCo sized bottle of Aleve my husband lost under ours. Emilio might be on to something, helping husbands to not be blamed for everything. Sasha can eat anything, thank goodness. Bonded and is allergic to everything? Lol you guys, well Emilio, are too much.\n\nEven though these pooches lost their home, at least they have each other to get through this. It wasn\u2019t like one dog got to stay and the other got the boot. I could see the many reasons why Emilio would meet the boot, however. We need that special someone who is ready for both. Perhaps grateful children who have been dying for a dog and would wash their dishes and eat the broccoli, for their chance at owning 2 furry babies. So if interested in an allergy prone, protective, chunky big brother and a dog named Sasha, please apply at leadrescue.org!",

            "description": "Nyla has affectionately earned the nickname \"The Velveteen Potato\" at our shelter for her adorably small and petit body and super soft (and beautiful) fur! This little nugget of gold came to us from a high volume shelter in Philadelphia when she was surrendered by her owners. They claimed they couldn't care for her anymore- but it looks like she has been a momma a few times over and we are happy that those days are gone! She can be a little shy at first but quickly warms up with EVERYONE! Due to her shy nature she would be best with children ages 12 and up, and a quiet household. She unfortunately cannot go into a home with cats as she does have a high prey drive. She LOVES to play with toys and is great with sharing them! As for her dog friends- she would need a quiet, submissive male (or the only princess in her castle!) Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org Primary Color: Blue Secondary Color: White Age: 4yrs 0mths 3wks",

            "description": "Toby is a handsome 9 year old black lab.  He is gentle and mild mannered.  He is a sweet old soul. Toby is looking for a forever where he can retire and spend his golden years being loved on and spoiled like all seniors should be. \n\nToby is super smart and knows how to sit, stay, come, and down (lay down).  He can even play dead! And as you can see, balance treats on his nose!  He is up for a game of fetch when he's feeling frisky. He is not great on a leash, because he will pull if something sparks his interest.  He would do best in a home with a fenced yard where he can mosey at his leisure.  He enjoys being outside on pretty days and enjoys the cooler weather.  He is not a fan of 100+ degree days in July/August! (But seriously...who is? I know I don't like to be hot and sweaty!)\n\nToby is ok with calm, well mannered, older dogs. He does not appreciate puppies that pester him and get in his face.  He is too old and set in his ways to appreciate the activity level on a young, high energy dog.  We are unsure how he would do with cats as he's never met one before. Toby would do best in an adult only home or a home with children 12 yrs and up.  He is not impressed with the toddler he is living with right now and the baby doesn't understand how to appropriately interact with an older dog.\n\nToby is fully vetted, up to date on vaccines, has been tested for heartworm and is neutered.\n\nPlease email sharonrunkel@yahoo.com for more info about Toby and how to set up a meet and greet with this sweet old man.",

He has a lot of energy and loves to play fetch and run around. He is potty trained but doesn\u2019t know many other commands so will need someone who is eager to teach him to be a great dog! He likes to go on walks and does not get tired easily. Max would do best with a family that either has a large yard for him to run around or has time to take him on long walks. He does great with all humans including kids.\n",

I am up to date on my vaccines and I take my Flea & Tick and Heartworm meds every month. I love going on car rides, playing outside, playing fetch with my inside toys, snuggling, sleeping on the couch, alone time in my crate (my choice) and having my hiney and inner back thighs scratched, I'll even lift my leg a little to help you get to the spot. \nI love to eat ice cubes, frozen carrots, peanut butter and cheese. I know commands like, sit, stay, wait, come, no, home (for my crate), out, food, are you hungry? and paw. I will tell you when it is time to go out and when I went to come back inside, I\u2019m housebroken. \nI love to be the center of attention and prefer to be the only pet so I hope that you are ready for that and all the love I have to give! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting me, please visit www.almosthomeli.org for an application.",

            "description": "Hello everyone meet Gunner! This 5 year old-ish Lab/Border Collie mix boy is about 55 lbs and will melt right into your lap and heart. Gunner had a rough start in his life but he is appreciative of everyone and everything around him. He loves to talk walks and it is truly awesome to watch him roll in the snow. Gunner enjoys being around people but is going to do best in a home where he is the only pet. Gunner is learning the crate is a safe place and he is doing really well at house breaking. If you are looking for an adult pup who gives as much as he gets, Gunner is your man!\n\n\nGunner should be the only dog in a home with a large fenced in yard and an active family. If the home has no fence the owners much commit to taking him for many walks and getting plenty of exercise.  \n\n\nThe adoption fee of $300 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! And that is the BEST breed!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup!\n\n*please note that we are a foster home based rescue and we do home visits as part of the adoption process - we are unable to adopt to families who live outside of the Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Thank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Rikko is quite the looker! This gorgeous boy came to our shelter originally a scared, trembling mess. With the help of a dedicated foster mom, he has thrived and learned how to be a dog that is safe and loved. Rikko gets along well with other friendly dogs and doesn't appear to mind cats. Despite being 9 years old, he still loves to run and play and will do anything for a squeaky toy. He has been very sweet and gentle with new people he meets, but can still get a bit nervous with quick movements. Due to this, we're recommending that his new home have no small children. Rikko requires another canine friend in his new home to help him feel secure and to show him the ropes. \n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Rikko, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Rikko.\n\nRikko\nPit Bull Terrier mix\nDOB: 12/1/2011\nWeight: 60 lbs.",

I also love going on my daily walks, and I keep my kennel clean and tidy. I have a genetic condition called pannus. This effects my eyes, and as a result I have pretty terrible vision. I get around pretty good though, and don't let it stop me from being a sweet and playful companion. I'll need daily eye medication to help my eyes, and the vets can tell you more about it if you call and ask for information. \n\nTo find out more about me you can fill out a pre-adoption survey on our website, then email it to us. Then, call (816) 325-7207 (ext.2) and ask to make an appointment for a digital meeting! I can't wait to meet you!\n\nhttps://www.ci.independence.mo.us/AnimalServices/AdoptableAnimals",
