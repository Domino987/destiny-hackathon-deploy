He already answers to 'sit' and even answers to 'no-no' by sitting down and staring at his human friend with the sweetest, most innocent and loving gaze. This playful dude is full of energy and excited to play fetch and tug-o-war in the play yard, romping with his human friends and doggie playmates. He's also making good progress on his leash-walking skills. Dusty is a fun-loving boy who hopes for adventures with humans who can continue his training, although he's so rapidly becoming well-behaved that training skills aren't completely necessary. He'd love to play fetch with active owners in a yard and would welcome a canine sibling. Come toss him a ball and he'll be your A+ graduate.",

You've come to the right place - meet Buster! This handsome little guy will warm your heart when he leans on you for pets, and keep your feet warm while you're stuck on that hours-long zoom meeting, and provide endless entertainment with his silly personality. Buster is a quiet pup who would thrive in a low-activity home. He loves routine, and is very easy to live with! He has a few neurological quirks that make some things a little tough for him - for example, he's a little off-balance (hey, not everyone is athletic!), and he will let you know when he's anxious by spinning in circles. We think those quirks make him even more endearing, and he's been working on some training exercises to be the best dog he can be. However, his vision isn't the best, but his excellent sniffer and super-sharp hearing make up for that! He enjoys sniffing around for treats hiding in the grass or just lying in the sunshine soaking up the rays. He's great at entertaining himself with toys and doesn't demand too much - just someone to love! If you're interested in learning more about this special pup, we'd love to tell you all about him! Buster is one-of-a-kind and would be a wonderful companion... and did we mention how handsome he is?! Come meet Buster today!",

            "description": "If you're looking for a new affectionate cuddle buddy who always wants to be right by your side and give you lots of kisses, then keep reading because Ocelot is your guy! This sweet, faithful, gentleman wants nothing more than to just be near his people every hour of every day, whether it be curled up on his bed or snuggled up on the couch with you. He is super mellow and loving, and likes to just snooze by your side (he makes the perfect quiet work-from-home buddy!). His past family had to give him up because they were traveling too much, otherwise they would've kept him forever as he was the perfect family dog. Ocelot does have an old, healed injury on his right paw and some arthritis in his elbow, but they don't slow him down one bit! He has the cutest gait and will paw at you endlessly for more attention and treats, all the while gazing at you with his deep, soulful eyes. He loves to explore the world and spend time outside - sleeping in the sun, sniffing all the new scents, and happily wiggle-worming in the grass. Ocelot is fully house-trained when let out 2-3 times a day, and is working on crate-training. He adores his 9yo and 16yo kids, and loves to romp around with his 2yo doggy sister in the living room. He has done incredibly well with some younger visitors, calmly greeting them and offering his belly for rubs. He is such a smart boy and very food-motivated, and is an absolute dream to walk on a leash. He is working on not jumping on people, counters, or couches uninvited, and he learned VERY quickly. But, he will not object if you let your pup pals on the couch. He has not been observed around cats yet, so we do not know how he will react to them. With his gorgeous brindle coat and kindhearted personality, Ocelot is the whole package! His ideal home would not have any stairs so he doesn't have to stress his joints, and preferably a yard so he can sunbathe to his heart's content. If you have room in your home and your heart for this good boy, come meet Ocelot, and he'll show you how much love he has to give!",

Swimming is a favorite activity and the ocean is her all-time favorite place! She will thrive in an active house where she gets lots of love and affection. She is house-trained, and does well in a crate or separate room in a house if her humans need to take care of errands. She can be a bit on the jealous side, so while she loves to play with other dogs, she'll need some help meeting new fur friends. She would also thrive in a home with adults and older children that can respect her space when needed. Come meet Bluebonnet, she is waiting to play tug-of-war with you!",

This youngster is as sweet as they come and seems most at ease when he's with other animals. Crowley's very shy at first, but warms up in time, then can't seem to get close enough to you. He's a good walker and he loves treats. Very tuned in with his environment, Crowley really perked up when he saw an older man on our return walk to the shelter. He began wagging his tail and pulling us in the man's direction. His demeanor changed to complete ease in that moment. Crowley's a gentle sweetheart seeking the same. His adoption fee is $150 and helps cover the cost of his neuter, vaccinations, worming, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive, microchip and care while at CCHS.",

This pretty girl has done fantastic with the shelter staff and doesn't seem to mind other dogs she has been around here at the shelter. We do not know if she likes cats but we always offer trial adoptions! Gilda Lilly should do great with kids of all ages and adjusts fairly quickly to new surroundings. This pretty girl weighs about 49 pounds and is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 1-12-21.\n\nHer adoption fee is $61.50 and she can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

She's vision impaired, but is a brave explorer and is learning how to navigate in her new surroundings. She also loves to explore the backyard. She will give you a little bark when she's ready to come back in the house and needs help finding the door.\n\nMinnie is comfortable around all dogs. She doesn't bother anyone.\n\nShe would be better suited to a forever home with no stairs to make her life comfy unless you are prepared to carry up and downstairs. But baby gates around the stairs would be a must for her safety.\n\nMinnie is somewhat independent. We think Minnie just got use to folks ignoring her and learned to fend for herself. Now she is enjoying our snuggles and sweet talk. We're confident she'll become more settled and less shy as she gets to know and love her new family!\n\nMinnie sleeps on a big fluffy bed in an xpen. Minnie prefers to do her business outside. She will need your assistance getting outside until she learns her way to the door. Are you ready to give Minnie her best chapter ever?\n\nMinnie is 11 years old and 11 pounds.\n\nMore photos: https://flic.kr/s/aHsmTAehLp\n\nMinnies Adoption fee is $255.\n\nFor adoption consideration or to meet our dogs\n\n, please complete our online application:\n\nwww.everypetsdream.org/adopt\n\nand\n\nwe will have everything we need to know to call you back and set up an appointment. Follow us:\n\nFacebook\n\nand\n\nInstagram\n\n.",

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

We appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response once you submit your application. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nBelle was surrendered to the shelter when found stray with a few of her babies in tow. We do not have any background information. Belle has really come out of her shell and is enjoying the affection of staff and volunteers. Belle's estimated DOB is 8/1/2017. She is likely done growing in size at 45 pounds. We cannot be sure if Belle is house trained; she walks great on a leash.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

Fast forward eight months and you would never know it\u2019s the same dog that was brought to us 15 pounds underweight and scared of everything. \n\nBuddy is a healthy 45 to 50 pounds who is so much fun to be around.

            "description": "Hello Hoomans! I am Shadow, I am about 3 years old and I weigh 50 lbs.. My life in north Georgia was completely turned upside down because I lost my Dad, and then 6 months later I lost my mom. I was adopted by them when I was about 7 months old and they went through my teenage years with me. They would always say that I was lucky that they loved me so much because I was a handful. I have matured quite a bit, but I am still an active pup and need someone who is confident, and calm, and if they have another pup in the home that's like that too, it makes me feel a lot better. :) Young kids scare me too. I ended up in daycare for about 60 days in the previous 4 months while my mom went in and out of the hospital, and it frazzled my nerves a little bit. I do a lot better in a calm home and I start to show my personality. \nI am neutered, up to date with my vaccines, microchipped, current on heartworm and flea preventatives. An application is required, no exceptions. My adoption fee is $350 and includes an adoption kit with a free bag of food and coupons for supplies. Please email petadopt@hotmail.com to get an adoption application for me. Thanks!",

She was very shy and scared.\n\nNow that all of Hera\u2019s pups have left the nest, she is a completely different dog! She\u2019s basically a puppy herself. She\u2019s about 2-3 years old, very playful and athletic. She\u2019s smart as a tack and would do great with an active family. \n\nShe loves playing with her human and dog foster siblings. She is fully vaccinated and has an appointment to be fixed in February with SNPLA.\n\nPlease email us or download an application from Pupswithoutborders.org if you\u2019re interested in Hera.

            "description": "Welcome sweet Holly to Worthy Dog Rescue! Holly was a chained dog who was not only starved and neglected but was being beaten by her former owner. Neighbors were monitoring the situation and reached out to rescue for help. Thankfully, some local animal advocates in this rural area of SC were able to negotiate her surrender. Holly was emaciated when we took her in, weighing only 35lbs, heartworm positive, and full of parasites. She has been in our care for almost a month now and has come such a long way. She has gained 15lbs, her coat has filled in nicely, she's been spayed, and she will be treated for heartworm next week.\n\nWhile Holly had a very rough early life, she still has a sweet, submissive nature and will be able to make a complete recovery with the right owner. She's excellent with other dogs and finds a lot of comfort in being around them. She is very affectionate with people once she gets to know them and will give you kisses for as long as you let her. Loud noises and sudden movements frighten her, which is understandable with her background. She was probably born outside and chained as a young puppy and got very little socialization or exposure to the outside world. She's still a young dog at only 1 to 1.5 years old and can look forward to a much better future.\n\nHolly has been fostered with several other dogs in South Carolina and has done well as part of a pack. She's calm in the house and has good house manners, and is housetrained and crate trained. Her crate is her safe space when she gets scared of something. Holly is learning to walk on a leash and walks much better with another dog by her side. She can easily get startled when walking on leash, so we believe she would do best in a quiet neighborhood vs. an urban or active area.\n\nHolly's foster mom describes her as having a moderate energy level and she's discovered her fondness for plush blankets and naptime on a comfy couch. She is fearful of meeting new people, especially men, and needs time to be comfortable with new things. She's not aggressive and would choose to flee or avoid any frightening situation if possible. She is doing better with her foster dad and will let him sit and pet her, but still won't come in the house if he opens the door.\n\nWhen Holly hears loud or sudden noises, she will start shaking and hope to disappear...it's going to take time for her to adapt to home life and feel secure. She recently met the grandkids and was skittish around them because they were noisy and overly excited to meet her.\n\nHolly really needs a patient owner and a calm environment to continue her rehabilitation. She is thriving at her foster home, having a nice big yard to romp in. She loves to zoom around the yard and is learning how to play with the other dogs. We think a home with another confident, social dog in a quiet suburban neighborhood is what Holly needs.\n\nHolly will be coming to N. VA in early February. Apply today to learn more about her and welcome her home.\n\nPreference will be given to:\n\nFamilies with another social, confident dog in the home\n\nSingle-family home in a quiet neighborhood\n\nExperience working with timid/fearful dogs\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: AmStaff (Pittie) mix\nGENDER: Female\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 44 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 1 to 1.5 years\nCOAT TYPE: Short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/spayed/microchipped/treated for heartworm\nLOCATION: Mathews, NC\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nGunner is a male German Shepherd born 4/2017.   Gunner is a big boy, at 85-90 lbs he has a giant head and feet and tons of coat.  He acts like a sweet teddy bear, super social and outgoing with all the people he meets, but very strong.   He was raised with another big dog and does better with larger dogs, small male dogs are not really his thing.    He will need a very strong owner with some large dog experience.  He has been through obedience school but gets very excited and could use a refresher in training.  \nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 1/15/2021\nAdoption fee: $350\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

MEET AND GREETS WILL BE IN TARZANA, CA \u2013 PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE POST\n\nhttps://pawsitivetailstoremember.forms-db.com/view.php?id=17980\n\nHERSHEY is 5 yrs old and weighs 4.8 lbs; she is a dainty and tiny female Chihuahua with a beautiful pale cream and chocolate short coat. This little girl is microchipped, current on vaccines and is spayed. We feel that we must tell potential adopters that Hershey is a fear biter with a ferocious attitude. She is definitely a big dog in a little dogs body. If she likes you, you\u2019re golden\u2026 if she doesn\u2019t\u2026.well you can fill in the rest. Hershey was recently adopted and returned for attacking and biting. Hershey seems to be people selective. \n\nThe perfect home will be with an EXPERIENCED Chihuahua owner who will be willing to seek out and work with a behaviorist if needed. We recommend that you leave her harness and leash on her during the transition period, that you use an x-pen so that you can easily get her out to potty, and that you purchase a little tent bed. That is her safe place. A doggie door would also be beneficial.\n\nFor companionship, we would prefer another small dog of like size and age in the home. Hershey is friendly with other dogs, she likes to be picked up and cuddled, but when she's in her tent bed she does not like to be picked up. Hershey is not a barker and we would consider Hershey to be a \u201ctea cup\u201d in terms of size which means that she can easily travel with you and she is potty trained using a doggie door. \n\nPTR Adoption Application:\nhttps://pawsitivetailstoremember.forms-db.com/view.php?id=17980\n\n\n",

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nSadie is a female purebred German Shepherd from working German lines.   She was born 12/2014 and is a perfect 70 lbs of an amazing dog.  Sadie is high energy and loves to walk/run.  She was raised with a male dog and a small chilld and does well with both.  She has been though obedience training and is pretty good on her basic commands.   She is social and outgoing and easy go get along with.  Because she is a big dog and a working dog, an experienced home with a strong owner would be best as she can pull on the leash a bit.   She is beautiful red/black, has a great coat and a nice personality.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption:  1/15/2021\nAdoption fee: $350\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

What a lovely pair they be!\n\nSweetie, the little white Terrier mix, and Freckles, the not much bigger gorgeous Catahoula Hound mix, are best friends forever! Their owner passed away and they ended up running the streets together until a kind neighbor took them in, had them completely vetted, and called us to help find them a perfect home together! They must stay together as they are definitely a bonded pair. Not quite twinkies, but a bonded pair indeed.\n\nLittle Sweetieis the boss and Freckles is her right-hand gal. They are a hoot together!Sweetie is like an alarm clock for breakfast and dinner so you'd better be on time with both or she will let you know. Freckles is a bit cautious meeting new people, but warms up soon. They are both very very sweet and smart too! Both give the gentlest of kisses. Both are crate trained. Although they keep their crates clean and dry and appear to be housetrained which took a bit of work..\n\nSo, if you want some small, sweet, smart, funny, furry companions, this is the pair for you! Oh, did I tell you they are a hoot together? Check out their video below and be sure to turn up the sound.\n\nHere you can see them in action...whirling dervishes... so much fun!!! https://youtu.be/fSYlYEK0MsM\n\nName: Sweetie & Freckles\nBreed: Sweetie (Jack Russell Terrier/Crossbreed) Freckles (Catahoula Mix)\nSex: Female\nAge: Estimates Sweetie 2 1/2 years Freckles 4 1/2 years\nWeight: 14 Sweetie 49 Freckles\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Positive and undergoing treatment.\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Unknown\nGood with Dogs: Unknown\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "Oliver is a great dog and doesn't mind a home with cats. We find that unusual and endearing because Oliver is a a bit high energy but he's smart, so very smart! He knows sit, stay, plays fetch and tug of war, shakes with both paws and is potty trained crate trained! The studies say it takes 3 days to decompress, 3 weeks to trust and learn routines, and 3 months to be the dog they really are! We hope his fosters see it sooner, but Oliver is great and ready to go to his forever home. Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online.We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

We have had no problem with him so we suspect there were other reasons.\n\nChip had his dental and no teeth were lost. Yea!!!  Chip is a laid back and happy dog.  He is very friendly when he meets new dogs and people.  Chip loves his people and loves to snuggle.  He wants to be with you and does not understand when he is left behind.  He does not like the crate and will bark and cry when he has to go in.  We are working with him on this.  Chip will adjust when he learns your schedule and understands you will come back for him.\n\nThis little guy loves to play with toys.  He is a typical dachshund and will destroy them in a heartbeat!  Chip is starting to play a little with my other dachshund.  I think he will start doing zoomies with her soon.  Another thing Chip loves is car rides.  He is always ready to be your little co-pilot!\n\nChip has a few more pounds to lose but it should not be a problem because he loves to go on walks.  He is trained to a doggy door and has not had any accidents.  He does not mark in the house.  Chip will use ramps/stairs he cannot jump.\n\nOur wish list for Chip includes:\n\u2022\tA fenced yard\n\u2022\tAnother adult small breed dog to keep him company and cuddle with.\n\u2022\tNo apartments or high rises\n\u2022\tSomeone home a lot because he does not like to be left alone.\n\u2022\tSomeone patient until he learns the rules of the house.\n\nIf you want great companion and snuggle buddy then please fill out an application.   Please don\u2019t make him wait for his forever home!!!\n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

He is estimated to be around 1.5 years old, weighs about 60lbs and joined us on December 20th.\n\nFoster Update: Ryder is a total snuggle bug with a lot of energy but is also very content laying by your feet. He does great with people and gets along well with the resident dog. They love to play. Ryder had no obedience skills and some puppy behavior that his fosters have been working on, he can get a little mouthy when he gets really excited and overstimulated. He's learned some basic commands and is now working on improving his duration without treats. He does ok in the crate when the resident dog is home but does get destructive when left completely alone so we think about dog in the home would be a huge plus and someone willing to continue to work with him on that.\n\nRyder would make a great hiking, running companion and will do best in an active home. He would prefer another dog in the home as he does better being left alone that way. He would also be a good candidate to go to work with you.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

He will require a special feeding position to let gravity move the food for him. Typical, happy, playful puppy Loves playing with other dogs Doing great with potty training\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog please visit this link to get the adoption process started.\n\nWe hold adoption events from San Francisco to the South Bay. Most dogs will be ready to go home the day of the adoption event. We accept credit cards and cash for our adoption fees. While adoption events are a great showcase for these amazing dogs, you don't need an adoption event to adopt a dog. Check out our adoptable pups, submit an application, and then meet them at their foster home!\n\nWe try to post the dogs that are attending on Facebook before the event, please visit and like us on Facebook.\n\nTo View other dogs up for adoption please visit our website.",

His favorite spot to nap is inside of his crate on his comfy bed. Scotty can sometimes be nervous/shy around smaller children so we are requiring that he go to a home with high school aged children and up. We recommend him as an only dog as he needs time to be properly socialized. He shows no signs of leash reactivity, just excitement so he will do best with an experienced handler.\nScotty will make a great hiking buddy and he has a lot of love to give.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Scotty, please submit your adoption application through our website istandwithmypack.org/adopt",

We have had no problem with him so we suspect there were other reasons.\n\nChip had his dental and no teeth were lost. Yea!!!  Chip is a laid back and happy dog.  He is very friendly when he meets new dogs and people.  Chip loves his people and loves to snuggle.  He wants to be with you and does not understand when he is left behind.  He does not like the crate and will bark and cry when he has to go in.  We are working with him on this.  Chip will adjust when he learns your schedule and understands you will come back for him.\n\nThis little guy loves to play with toys.  He is a typical dachshund and will destroy them in a heartbeat!  Chip is starting to play a little with my other dachshund.  I think he will start doing zoomies with her soon.  Another thing Chip loves is car rides.  He is always ready to be your little co-pilot!\n\nChip has a few more pounds to lose but it should not be a problem because he loves to go on walks.  He is trained to a doggy door and has not had any accidents.  He does not mark in the house.  Chip will use ramps/stairs he cannot jump.\n\nOur wish list for Chip includes:\n\u2022\tA fenced yard\n\u2022\tAnother adult small breed dog to keep him company and cuddle with.\n\u2022\tNo apartments or high rises\n\u2022\tSomeone home a lot because he does not like to be left alone.\n\u2022\tSomeone patient until he learns the rules of the house.\n\nIf you want great companion and snuggle buddy then please fill out an application.   Please don\u2019t make him wait for his forever home!!!\n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

We have had no problem with him so we suspect there were other reasons.\n\nChip had his dental and no teeth were lost. Yea!!!  Chip is a laid back and happy dog.  He is very friendly when he meets new dogs and people.  Chip loves his people and loves to snuggle.  He wants to be with you and does not understand when he is left behind.  He does not like the crate and will bark and cry when he has to go in.  We are working with him on this.  Chip will adjust when he learns your schedule and understands you will come back for him.\n\nThis little guy loves to play with toys.  He is a typical dachshund and will destroy them in a heartbeat!  Chip is starting to play a little with my other dachshund.  I think he will start doing zoomies with her soon.  Another thing Chip loves is car rides.  He is always ready to be your little co-pilot!\n\nChip has a few more pounds to lose but it should not be a problem because he loves to go on walks.  He is trained to a doggy door and has not had any accidents.  He does not mark in the house.  Chip will use ramps/stairs he cannot jump.\n\nOur wish list for Chip includes:\n\u2022\tA fenced yard\n\u2022\tAnother adult small breed dog to keep him company and cuddle with.\n\u2022\tNo apartments or high rises\n\u2022\tSomeone home a lot because he does not like to be left alone.\n\u2022\tSomeone patient until he learns the rules of the house.\n\nIf you want great companion and snuggle buddy then please fill out an application.   Please don\u2019t make him wait for his forever home!!!\n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

She is an affectionate sweet girl who loves to snuggle although she can be slightly nervous around new people. She is dog friendly and prefers more mellow dogs. She does have separation anxiety and so would do best in a home with another calm, confident dog to keep her company (unless her new \"human\" is always home). She has not been around cats but we assume she would be fine. She does well with poultry, horses, and other livestock. Sophie is not super playful although she loves going for walks. Instead, she prefers the finer things in life, like cuddling on the couch with her human. Sophie will only be adopted out to a home without children or older, considerate children (12+)\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sophie, please submit an adoption application located on our website, coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $250 adoption donation. Sophie is spayed, housebroken, up to date on vaccinations, and microchipped.\n\nCCR cannot hold dogs, arrange meet and greets or adopt out any dogs without a completed adoption application.\n\nCCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter.\n\nDogs listed as potty trained may experience an adjustment period as they learn the routines in their new home.",

            "description": "Oakley lived his life mostly outdoors without much socialization. His family decided moving to a cold climate would be too hard on him and relinquished him to SCGRR. We believe he is a combination of flat coat retriever and a herding breed such as Australian Shepard. He is very smart and energetic even for 9 years old. He quickly bonds to his humans and seeks comfort from them whenever he is nervous. He loves car rides, being rubbed under the chin and along his back. And he has the most adorable white paws!!!\n \nOakley will need several weeks to settle into his new home. Once adjusted, Oakley\u2019s soulful eyes will melt your heart and he will love you to the moon and back. He loves exercise and affection and toys. He is looking for a calm, experienced and confident adult human (or humans) to trust and help him adjust to the bigger world around him. When you are working from home, he will lay at your feet calmly. But he is game for a jog or hike also. He is house broken and affectionate. He is a picky eater but salmon, chicken and cheese are quite appreciated! He is very dog reactive so should be an only dog in a community where he can work on his leash skills at some distance from other dogs. He also has a prey drive so no other pets in the home other than maybe a fish! No cats, bunnies or other small critters. If you have critters in your yard, he will suss them out for you and maybe dig a few holes if they live underground. Young children under 15 are also not a good idea. A quiet home would be best without a lot of new experiences (aka camping trips) or visitors for quite some time.\n \nAfter adjusting to his new home environment, Oakley needs a commitment to slow and patient socialization to adjust to the world at large. He is leash reactive and at the moment is staying far away from other dogs and even small children in push cars. He will try to chase cats and other creatures. A willingness to work with a positive reinforcement behaviorist or experience in dealing with a dog like Oakley is important unless you live a more rural existence where such interactions might not be so critical. Oakley has mostly known his back yard. As a first step on his journey, he is learning to \u201cself soothe\u201d in his foster home \u2013 finding ways to calm himself down rather than seeking human comfort \u2013 something that will help him become a more balanced dog.\n \nIf you are ready to give this nervous but loving dude all the patience and guidance he deserves, please contact his friend Lori at regadog1010@gmail.com and tell her about how he will spend his days with you. Oakley is currently residing in Westminster, CA.\n \nAs a 9 year old, the minimum adoption donation for Oakely is $350\n\n**PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO COVER AND ADOPT OUT TO HOMES IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA**",

When no one came to claim him, GSROC got the call from the shelter staff. We have made room for him in our lifeboat.\n\nStitch is enrolled in our obedience class and performing well. He is a smart guy and enjoys learning things and showing others all the he knows.\n\nStitch is happy staying right next to his handler and drinks up all the affection he can. He is in our training class and doing well. He was hesitant about other dogs when he first arrived and is working on interacting with other dogs.\n\nStitch likes to follow the rules. When out on pack walks, he likes to monitor and make sure all the dogs are keeping up and following the rules. Watch his video to see how he prances when he walks!\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

You will be too!\n\nPenny Lane is a sweet little girl, who is friendly to people but shy in new situations. It appears that she has been used for breeding and than cast aside. Now, is that any way to treat her? We certainly don't think so and have promised her that all of that is behind her now. Penny Lane is hoping to find a quiet home where she can be loved.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

Macon is available for pre-adoption and has a $180.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. Pre-adoption means approved adopters selected may do a meet and greet, complete the adoption and put a \"hold\" on their puppy, then take them home when old enough. Puppies will be available to go home as soon as they are at least 8 weeks old, healthy and have finished their vaccinations. PUPPIES UNDER THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS CANNOT BE ADOPTED OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE TULSA AREA. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

My foster mom does that for me 3 times a day and she said that I am the easiest one that she has ever had to do and she is willing to teach anyone how to do it.\n\nI am a big cuddle bug. I always want to be around you.\n\nI do like to play with my siblings at the house ( both cats and dogs) .\n\nI think I would be ok with little kids but I haven't been around them before.\n\nI only say I think because like I mentioned before..I am a special dog.\n\nAny number of things could have happened but I try my hardest to use my back legs as much as I can. I dont have control of my bladder- which is why I need help expressing it.\n\nI do have a wheelchair but if I had to have a preference, I would like to try to use all my legs to walk. However if you like to go on some small walks, I will use my wheelchair because once I am in it, I can go fast:)\n\nI am only 5 pounds and almost 2 years old. I am neutered and up to date on my shots. My adoption fee is $190 and does not include the $11 PACC license transfer fee. My wheelchair/cart comes with me too.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an adoption application at tucsoncoldwetnoses.com or email info@tucsoncoldwetnoses.com with any questions.\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required.

My foster mom says I'm a combination of a super model, professional ball player and rocket scientist. I walk well on a leash, enjoy car rides and taking adventures.\n\nI know my basic commands and am very eager to learn new things. I take treats gently from your hand and am learning to be patient and wait for my food. My foster mom says I am very smart and when treats are involved I can train all day. Sometimes my foster mom wonders who is training who. I'm a typical female shepherd so I know my own mind but I am loving and very sweet.\n\nI like dogs and hanging out with my foster pack. I've been to the park on pack walks with other dogs and I did great. I'm learning how to settle when I'm out of my crate and need some supervision but, I am not destructive. I would like to be an only dog so I can get lots of love and attention that I never got when I was a puppy. I love petting and affection.\n\nFrom my foster mom: Mora is a wonderful girl. She has come so far and learning more each day. She is learning to trust and starting to enjoy life. Mora is a happy girl, very confident with great nerves and a wonderful temperament. At times, she can be pushy but that's because she is a confident girl but, with light verbal correction she listens. She is very affectionate and super sweet. Mora is a beautiful girl and needs an\nEXPERIENCED HANDLER THAT HAS OWNED PURE BRED GERMAN SHEPHERDS\nand understands the intelligence of the breed. Mora requires exercise each day which includes ball play in her fenced backyard. She is an excellent companion and will sit next to you while you are gardening. Did I mention Mora LOVES vegetables? Mora is good with children, BUT WE WILL NOT PLACE HER IN A HOME WITH CHILDREN UNDER 16.\n\nMora is\nspayed, microchipped, current on vaccinations, on heartworm preventative, crate trained, leash and basic obedience trained and house broken. If you are interested in this beautiful, affectionate girl, please fill out an online application at the\nhttps://form.jotform.com/bmsr/application\nIf you have any questions, you can contact Donna J. at\nBMSR1313@gmail.com\n\n.\nWE WILL ONLY CONSIDER ADOPTERS WHO HAVE OWNED PURE BRED GERMAN SHEPHERDS, NO CHILDREN UNDER 16 AND A SECURE FENCED IN YARD.\nOUR ADOPTION AREA IS NC and SC.\n\nBlue Moon Shepherd Rescue only adopts to applicants in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. If you are interested in being considered to adopt this dog, please fill out an online application by clicking here.\n1/25/21 4:32 PM",

For this reason we consider Lilian \u201cspecial needs\u201d, she has been checked by an orthopedic specialist and there isn\u2019t anything that can be done for her, this is just the way she is, BUT don\u2019t let that fool you!\n\nLilian is very playful and loves to run around with the other dogs. She is a quiet girl who is very excited to meet new people. Lilian however is very scared of children so a home without young kids will be needed for her.",

He is 90% angel and 10% crazy! Neo is really enjoying his life with his foster family. He gets along great with the other dogs in his foster home, but is not too fond of the neighborhood cats. He loves to run and play rough and tumble, but listens to the older dogs when they ask him to calm down. He shares toys and enjoys a good game of tug-o-war. Neo is learning commands and has mastered \"Sit,\" \"Shake,\" and \"Come.\" He loves to play fetch and is really awesome at it! He is very patient and gentle when taking treats and is happy to go to bed in his crate at night. He loves car rides and is a good road trip companion.\n\nNeo is working on a few issues, including house training. Like many puppies, he loves being outside so much that he forgets to do his business. He is also a bit protective of his resources. For Neo this means his family and especially his foster dad. He is skeptical of strangers and takes time to warm up to new people. But once he does, he is loving and playful. We are working on letting him know he can let his guard down. Due to his resource protecting and somewhat unpredictable reactions, we recommend that Neo be placed in a home with older children (teens and up) who have dog experience. Neo would also do best with a fur sibling to help show him the ropes.\n\nPlease visit our website if you would like to submit an adoption application.\n\nNeo's Adoption Donation Fee is $325. Neo is neutered, current on all vaccinations, has received a wellness exam and is microchipped.\n\nI Dream of Home Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization.\n\nTAX ID: 81-0780050\n\nI Dream of Home Rescue\nPO Box 7612, La Verne, California 91750\n\nwww.idohr.org\n\nwww.facebook.com/IDOHR.ORG\n\n1/31/21 4:28 PM",

We're trying to find a family that will welcome them both since they're bonded. They're both seniors, but still have a lot of love to give! \n\nKrissy is 12 yrs old but you wouldn't know it, she still has quite a bit of playful spunk left in her, she acts much younger than she is.  She's such a doll, affectionate and sweet, definitely a cuddle bug! :)  She's a Teddy Bear Chihuahua/Doxi mix, so low to the ground and fast! lol  She's very playful, loves to play with her toys and other dogs, and her favorite thing to do is cuddle with her humans. :)  She's fixed, microchipped, current on shots, heart worm tested and a blood panel done to ensure she's a healthy girl!  \n\nZuki is approx. 14 yrs. old, neutered, microchipped, current on shots, heart worm tested, as well as a blood panel to make sure he was healthy.  He's old but he's still got spunk! lol  He actually sleeps most of the day and loves to cuddle...if you're looking for a lap dog, he's your guy!  A trait his sister Krissy enjoys too! \n\nIf interested in meeting Zuki and Krissy, please visit our website at, www.doggonerescue.com, to fill out our adoption application, that'll get the ball rolling! If you have any questions about these two furkids please don't hesitate to let us know, we look for to hearing from you!",

Sadly, her mom has since had some serious health issues that meant she had to move into assisted living and could not take care of this sweet dog. Delilah is now being fostered in St. Louis, Missouri and is doing very well. \n\nShe is 10 years old, but do not let her age fool you! She is still an active dog that loves walks and especially loves her honking pig toy, but she loves food more than anything else in the world. Delilah is currently 65 lbs, but she is on a weight-loss journey and she has already lost almost 7 1/2#!  Despite being overweight, the vet describes her as \u201chealthy as a horse\u201d and she is spayed and up to date on all her shots. \n\nDelilah will need a home without cats, small children, or other dogs, but she loves her humans fiercely and even smiles at you when you get home. To inquire about adopting this sweet girl, please fill out an application here!  www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\n\nAdd adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

I don't have much life experience yet and need your help with some training since I'm still a puppy. I'm always on the go, love to play and am full of energy. My favorite toys are the rope toy and chew toys and bones. I'm very excited to meet new people and may jump on them--I'm just trying to give them a hug--nothing aggressive! I've only been with my foster family for a couple of weeks, and I have mastered the stairs (was afraid at first), learned to potty outside, and am working on sit and other commands. I'll be watching for you to come meet me--hope that's soon. Love, Clay",

He will sit on command and offer his paw; and he was so enthusiastic about getting a treat that he would sometimes even stand on his back legs like a human but not jump on me. So cute! He loved playing fetch with a ball and tug rope. He did his business outside so probably house trained. Tatum certainly seemed eager to please and loved affection. He has the softest and most beautiful color coat of fur and just waiting for some good lovin' from an individual or family that has a secure fenced in yard. He seemed to be fine with other dogs when we had him on leash and encountering others but always a good idea if you are considering adoption to do a \"meet and greet\" with your own dog(s). He has been fostered and got a good report and even on his shelter behavioral assessment he got good grades. Please come in to meet this boy in person and find out more about him from our adoption counselors and foster coordinator. I bet you will fall in love with this personable and playful guy. \n\nObservations by volunteer S. Shaffer - 2/1/21",

            "description": "Willow is 2 years old and 70 lbs. The girl loves to eat so little heavier than she should be! She is active and very happy all the time. One day her nose started swelling and the vet gave her an injection to bring it down. It has taken a few months to completely heal and now her hair is coming back in. If you are interested in Willow please fill out an application at Labs4rescue.com.\n\nFor additional information about Willow please email Marla Cox at mclabs4rescue@gmail.com. \n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: We receive many questions about our adoption process from potential adopters, most of which can be answered by viewing our \"Adopt a Lab\" page on our full service website, https://labs4rescue.com/.   To expedite the process, please follow the step-by-step instructions outlined and submit an adoption application listing 3-5 dogs of interest. Please hurry as your new best friend is waiting for you!\n\nADOPTION FEES: $445 non-refundable adoption fee for all vet expenses (spay/neuter, shots, etc.) and transportation to ensure your lab gets to you in a safe, professional manner. All fees may be paid using PayPal, cashier's checks, or money orders. Labs4rescue does not accept personal checks for adoption fees. All adopters must pay their Labs4rescue adoption fee prior to the rescue shipping their dog.\n\nResidents of Massachusetts or New Hampshire are required to pay an additional $125 fee, which defrays the cost of their state's mandatory 48 hour isolation and examination by a licensed veterinarian.",

            "description": "Meet Zuki boy!  He's actually the first skipper breed I've met that's been nice! ;)    They can all be a little feisty at times, but Zuki is a sweetheart. He can be a little nervous upon meeting people, but warms up quickly, especially if treats are involved! lol  \n\nHe's approx. 14 yrs. old, neutered, microchipped, heart worm tested, as well as a blood panel to make sure he was healthy.  He's old but he's still got spunk! lol  He actually sleeps most of the day and loves to cuddle...if you're looking for a lap dog, he's your guy!  A trait his sister Krissy enjoys, she enjoys too.  She and his fursister Krissy were rescued from an apt. fire.  They're bonded so we're trying to find a home to welcome the both. :)  \n\nKrissy is 12 yrs old but you wouldn't know it, she still has quite a bit of playful spunk left in her, she acts much younger than she is.  She's such a doll, extremely affectionate and sweet.  She's definitely a mix!  We were told she's a Teddy Bear Chihuahua/Doxi mix, so low to the ground but fast! lol  She's very playful, loves to play with her toys and other dogs, and her favorite thing to do is cuddle with her humans. :) She's extremely friendly. \n\nIf interested in meeting Zuki and Krissy, please visit our website at, www.doggonerescue.com, to fill out our adoption application, that'll get the ball rolling! If you have any questions about these two furkids, don't hesitate to let us know, we look for to hearing from you!",

He was born in protective custody and is only one of a handful of pups that survived.  Elliott spent the first year of his life in a kennel and we are seeking a foster home and/or a forever family in order to remove him from the shelter. \nThe caring staff at the shelter has been working with Elliot.  He is already almost walking on leash and is doing really well hanging out in the Placement Coordinator's office. He is very goofy, food motivated, seems very interested in meeting other dogs, and loves rope toys. Still a little shy with humans and will flinch away if approached too quickly, but he is showing interest and play bowing when excited. \nPlease go to our website at www.dobermanrescuenm.org and complete an application to help this sweet boy grow up into an awesome Doberman!",

She loves belly rubs, sunshine and relaxing with people once she knows she is safe. While tentative early on, she is the first to give the go-ahead for pets and signs of affection. \n\nMouse is the tiny guy! The foster family refers to Mouse as a micro-coyote. He looks like a small shepherd or coyote with sweet, kind eyes. Mouse takes a little longer to warm up, but he greatly appreciates head scratches and will greet an exciting moment by spinning in circles.  \n\nBoth dogs are still a little skittish, but slowly getting more comfortable and affectionate with their fosters. They do well with going potty outside or using a potty pad when the doors are shut. Not sure on cats .No your children please text 702 239 7986",

            "description": "Homer is one of our hospice dogs. He has been having some anxiety issues so he is now on some anxiety medication and his bloodwork indicates he may have Cushings, so further tests are needed. \n\nHomer was found as a stray and taken to an open intake shelter and not reclaimed by his owner. He is a 13-year-old schnauzer and about 4 years ago, he ate a chicken bone, and had bowel surgery so he has frequent bowel movements, including diarhea. \n\nPlease consider SPONSORING Homer to help with his medical needs. You can click on the \"Sponsor\" button or Donations can be made to our Paypal at petprofilerescue@gmail.com or https://paypal.me/petprofilerescue to help with Ram's medical care.\n\nOur senior dogs could use the fish oil, Chlorehexidine mousse for skin issues, Cosequin for joint issues, and Denamarin for liver issues. Our rescue dogs' Amazon Wishlist is here: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1PIG0Y2YAZ2MP\u2026\n\nWe require an adoption application, phone interview, virtual house check, and meet and greet with your entire family.

            "description": "ADOPT ME ONLINE: https://ophrescue.org/dogs/9132\n\nMia is brimming with personality and overflowing with devotion. She is VERY active - ready to be your running buddy or your hiking pal. This little energizer bunny never runs out of go. She is believed to be 2-3 years old and currently weighs about 45 lbs. Everyone who meets her comments that she is much smaller than she looks in pictures. She's a solid 45 pounds, but not a big 45 pounds.\n\nMia is very smart, trainable, and treat-motivated. She has mastered basic obedience (sit, down, stay) and learned to ring the bells on the foster's doors to let them know she needs to go out. She quickly learned how to use a doggy door and is very respectful of the fence and baby gates. Mia is doing great with leash manners and would likely love the challenge of agility or more training.\n\nMia loves chew toys and rope toys and anything that squeaks, plus is happy to play fetch or tug, but she's equally happy to snuggle with you on the couch.\n\nMia gets very excited when she sees new people and recently gave a visiting plumber a tongue bath while he worked. She understands that four-feet-on-the-floor gets her more attention, but sometimes she can't help herself. She is housebroken and crate trained in her foster home. Mia needs plenty of exercise and should not be in a home with cats because she loves to chase small animals. \n\nThis sweet girl is ready to find her forever family - she has so much love and devotion to give! To see more pictures and stories of Mama Mia, visit her foster mom's blog, www.AnotherGoodDog.org.\n\nClick here and here to see her in foster care! \n\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

She\u2019s had a hard life thus far, fending for herself in the woods and raising her litter of 10 puppies before she was taken into rescue\u2014she\u2019s a tired momma! Sage is housebroken, loves her crate, scratches and will dance for her dinner! She has decided the indoor life is for her! Sage is timid of new people and things, and she will need time to warm up to you and patience when introducing new things. She is able to take very short walks on a leash. Sage is wonderful with other dogs, and ignores the foster family\u2019s rabbit in his cage. She takes a treat so very gently! Sage has not been tested around cats or young children. A home with adults and children who are calmer would be the best fit for her (other dogs would be great too!). Can you give this sweet girl her forever home?\n\nPlease visit halfwaythererescue@gmail.com for information on meeting and/or adopting Sage!",

She was surrendered to us by her owner who wasn't interested anymore after the puppy stage. She is crate trained, so that will be important. Layla will need some training meeting other dogs because she gets super excited and dogs can get annoyed. She is being fostered with dogs now. She would make a great 2nd dog too, or would be fine going solo. \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

This condition is responsible for her gorgeous coat and icy blue eyes, and as a result of it she is 100% deaf. A dog\u2019s sense of hearing is very important, and without it Helen has naturally developed some defensive behaviors. Wary at first of new people and dogs, she warms up into a superbly happy, playful and affectionate girl as soon as she feels safe. She:\n\u2022\tIs 45 pounds\n\u2022\tIs working on house training\n\u2022\tIs good with other dogs, but will snap if startled by a dog that she doesn\u2019t see approaching\n\u2022\tIs not good for a home with children\n\u2022\tWalks nicely in a harness\n\u2022\tIs medium to high energy\nHelen needs a very special home that can take it slow with her and is prepared for the challenge of training a dog unable to hear commands. So worth the effort though, she adores the people in her life and will pour love into her new family. She has fully won our hearts and given the chance will certainly capture yours!\n\nHelen is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative. \n\nFor more information about Helen or our shelter please call us at (830) 693-0569 or visit our website at highlandlakescaninerescue.org \n\nIf you would like to schedule a meet and greet with Helen or any of our dogs, please fill out an application at highlandlakescaninerescue.org/application-for-adoption\n",

            "description": "Opal is a 5/6  year old 54 lb white dog  mix foster in Olympia, WA. We estimate ages based on what the vets tell us. Every dog sees a vet upon intake, when they are spayed/neutered and again for a health certificate just prior to coming to the NW. Usually at least two different vets (which is always good to get different opinions on the age of the dog etc)\n\n \n\nOpal is part boxer or part bulldog or ? We do not know. She had a litter in TX and now is spayed. She is energetic, affectionate, and attentive. She likes walks and is house and crate trained. She is a great companion for an active family with a secure fence \n\nShe is an indoor dog who enjoys car rides, dog bones and dog beds. She loves her humans' companionship indoors. She will require daily walks and some dog training as she still pulls toward passerbys in some circumstances.\n\nShe is attentive to her human companions, but is interested in other people and dogs on walks.\n\nOpal is a 6 Year old 54 lb Bulldog Terrier mix. In foster in Olympia, WA\nShe is a semi energetic and affectionate gal who loves her humans only! She is crate trained and likes walks. She is a great companion for an active family with a secure 6 ft fence. Bulldog experience is required. She is an indoor dog. She likes walks, car rides, dog bones and dog beds. She loves her humans companionship indoors. She will require daily walks and some dog training. Will require 6 ft fence. No apartments, rentals or children under 12 years of age.\n\nThis is a posting for HHS (Helotes Humane Society). You can fill out and application below. Yes you must COPY and PASTE this application link.\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/HTX/Exotic/Other\n\nImportant: If you are interested in this pup/dog, please fill out the application (link listed above). The rescue will contact you once the application is received. Although we strive to answer everyone, due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we cannot guarantee a response to all emails. Filling out the application is the ONLY way and ensures a response from the rescue. In addition, while you are emailing us, if others apply, you lose out adopting the dog you chose. We have hundreds and hundreds of puppies/dogs available so there really is no need to apply anywhere else. However, if you are applying or have applied anywhere else, we do need to know that.\n\nSHANYE'S FOSTERS is a group of foster parents in the Olympia/Tumwater area. We foster dogs for rescues and assist them in adopting/rehoming of their pups/dogs by listing on this site. Many dogs posted here are available to pre adopt NOW directly from the rescue. The only ones in foster in the NW specifically state that. We have very few fosters so most need to be pre adopted. All adoption fees go towards rescuing more dogs in need. No one receives a salary. Shayne's Fosters is not responsible for any experience you have with any dog you might see posted on this site. They are the property of the sponsoring rescue who will supply all medical supporting records which is given with each dog when adopted.\n\nOur adoption fees cover all medical costs to make sure the pups are appropriately vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and spayed/ neutered. It also covers the cost of transportation from Texas and the necessary health certificate documentation. The fees also include a negative heart-worm test for any dogs over 6 months. Some dogs/pups have additional medical, including but not limited to FHO, ACL, hernias, dental, and a myriad of other vetting. If the adoption fees seem high (which never cover the true cost of rescue), we recommend fostering for a good rescue. Fostering ensures you incur no vet bills and no boarding fees. We are always in need of good fosters. We are all volunteers who donate our time and resources to help save as many dogs/pups as we possibly can.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt a rescue pup/dog. Worldwide over 1/2 or 1 billion puppies/dogs are PTS yearly. thousands and thousand daily (yes entire litters, pregnant/nursing moms are PTS daily just in U.S. shelters. Yes even entire litters of puppies yes DAILY in many US shelters! We firmly believe there is NO breed other than rescue for all species. Thank you for being part of the village it takes to save these precious lives.",

He's back in the shelter again, brought in by his family on Jan. 10  because they thought he was too rough with the kids. We don't know how old the kids were, so it's possible he might be better with older kids. He is a playful dog, and he knows sit, shake and lay down. He loves treats and will work for them. His family said he's good with other animals and is house-trained. He's not happy at the shelter, of course -- no intelligent dog would be -- and he wants a home with people who love him. Paco has been neutered and will be heartworm tested upon adoption. He is about 1.5 years old and 62 pounds. Come meet him in Run 833, using ID#626816.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

He was held for the mandatory five days but his previous owners never came forward. He is said to be around two years old. This guy is thick with lots of muscle but the funniest thing is he thinks he is a toy breed. He's very sensitive, sometimes afraid of his own shadow, and goofy as the day is long. He should do fine with older kids, but because he is young, timid and kind of clumsy, younger kids are not a good idea. If he is to pair up with another dog, I'm looking for a dog that is more his personality so that he doesn't feel intimated. To be on the safe side, NO cats! We cannot test him accurately in a shelter setting! \n\nWhoever does end up bringing this guy into their family is gonna be extremely lucky to call him theirs. You're guaranteed to have a friend for life! He's going to make you his whole world and there's no greater love than what a dog has for his/her human. \n\nIf you are serious in adopting Creed, please submit an application online at PawtucketAnimalShelter.com.\n\n If you have any further questions on Creed, please contact ACO Charlene at #401-616-2561!",

Just under a year old, Randall is a fun, active pittie mix who loves his walks and playing with his ball but don't fear, he loves his naps as well - especially when they come with snuggles! When he is ready to chill he'll climb on the couch and cuddle close.\n\nHe's just happy to be included in whatever you're doing...wherever you are is where he wants to be!\n\nRandall does love his chew toys as well and can't wait to have some of his very own in his furever home. He does well in both the car and crate and seems to already know to do his business outside, as he'll let you know he needs to go out by sitting at the door. He has proven to possess excellent leash manners as well! Randall loves children, and while he gets along just fine with other dogs he would be happy to be the only dog in your home. He is treat motivated, but also easily motivated by just attention and picked up on \"sit\" quickly.\n\nRandall is a lovebug who would be a great addition to a lucky family!\nThis guy is ready to find his forever family and is sure to be the happiest dog on the block wherever he ends up!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Meet Murphy!! Doc Murphy but we just call him Murphy.\n\nMurphy is believed to be about 8 to 10 years young. Really we don't know because when he was rescued 2 plus years ago, he was in horrific conditions. \n\nMurphy has been on more trial adoptions then any other dog. Only because with in 24 hours people feel they can't bond but you give him the time to adjust and learn his new floor plan surrounding and he's the best dog ever.  See, Murphy is fully retired. All he wants to do is make up for lost time, enjoy life to the fullest. He wants to sleep peacefully, eat all he can eat all the time, enjoy life pass by without worries or concerns or stressing about surviving. Murphy just wants to live a happy calm life. \n\nMurphy most likely was born with poor eye sight and with time has lost it completely. But that does not affect him! He just wants to eat, sleep, sunbath, watch..... in his case listen to the news or radio, enjoy his toys and simple daily walks and the occasional car rides, why not?!  His favorite dog beds are round dog beds. He loved to donut roll in them. He overheard retirement is the way too go so he's sticking with it. \n\nWhen Murphy arrived he was heartworm and lyme disease positive as well had very bad skin condition. All which could of been prevented if he was not neglected and sentenced to live chained up outdoors most of his life. Murphy is a chill dude. He enjoys companionship. He is an independent dog and if he has a need he can't solve on his own, he will speak up. He's not an early bird dog either. He is in great health now and living it up. He is also awesome with kids, and dogs too but due to his poor eye sight he's best as an only dog/pet in the home. Only because he was attacked by dogs in 2 separate occasions. Once on a pack walk by 2 stray dogs, another when he was on a trial adoption and the potential adopter thought the dog park was ok to visit....... ????. Like, how? Another dog in the dog park litterally attacked him for no reason. See, most dogs struggle when meeting a blind or deaf dog. And while Murphy is good with dogs it's just best he's an only pet and gets all the attention to himself. And yes his daily walks or 2 is a must for him. As well as a nice size fenced in yard. \n\nDid we already mention how Murphy loves kids? He's a superstar with them.\n\nTraining is an ongoing process that has to be worked on daily. New issues opportunities show up daily that have to be addressed and or rewarded. Continue training is a must.\n\nAdoption application and processes information can be found on our website www.animalhousesanctuary.org or by emailing us at animalhousesanctuary@yahoo.com\n\nName your price adoption with a minimum of $150\n\nDate: 1/15/21",

My hobbies include eating kibble, doing laps around my foster house, napping under blankets, and of course looking cute. I would prefer a human with a house or apartment without too many steps, because I have no idea how they work. I mean, first you\u2019re up there and now you\u2019re down here?\u00a0 Make up your mind, human. If you insist on steps, you can feel free to carry me. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nYou should know I have glaucoma in one eye and an early-stage cataract in the other. This means I need an eye drop twice a day for my glaucoma, but I\u2019m used to it, so it will only take you a couple seconds. I see well enough to get around, but sometimes bump into things until I get my bearings in a new house. I don\u2019t hear anymore, so just give me hand signals if you need something. You don\u2019t have to tell me it\u2019s dinnertime. My sniffer works just fine. I just had a dental procedure and am down to five teeth, but don\u2019t let it fool you: I love to eat!\n\nI am mostly potty trained, both outdoors and indoors on puppy pads, but I have been known to have a few accidents. If you are patient with me and remind me it\u2019s time to potty I shouldn\u2019t have too many problems. I am used to sleeping in a crate at night for my own safety, so long as it has a cozy bed and I can wear my cute pajamas to keep warm. I have a sweet disposition and would be okay as an only dog or if you have another senior dog. I don\u2019t think I would do well in a house with kids. My ideal human would be someone who is home a lot and likes to keep things low-key. We can snuggle, watch Netflix and of course eat!\n\nVisit us on FB at: http://www.facebook.com/IGrescueVa.

I love to be right next to you or even in your lap, but if I can't be there I'll be close by! I get along with other dogs, big and small, and I don't pay much attention to the cat in my foster home. I'm house trained and crate trained, and I'm learning commands like \"sit and \"kennel.\" I'm even learning to walk on a leash - I like going outside and sniffing around, but not too sure about that leash yet! Please hurry and apply for me so we can start our lives together!",

            "description": "Marty is a Chihuahua approx 4 years old and weighs about 11 pounds.. Marty was rescued from Maricopa County and has been with Tucson Cold Wet Noses for two years. Now you might ask why so long? Marty needed some fine tuning. He was fearful of people and other dogs and would not always be on his best behavior. To make Marty more comfortable we gave him time and training to build up his confidence and to work on some of his fears no matter how long that might take.\nMarty has had two fosters since being with Tucson Cold Wet Noses. He does well with other dogs but does best in a small dog home. Marty's first foster mom (who broke her leg hense the move) said he was fearful of the bigger dogs in the home but did well with the small dogs.\nMarty takes time to warm up to his human but once he feels comfortable will seek out affection on his terms. He likes to cuddle but has boundaries and again it does take a little time to fully accept you but it's well worth the wait Marty behaved well at the vets which we are so proud of. He is a dog in progress but what strides he has made. Marty would do well with No Children in the home, a home that as at least one other dog as he does follow their lead. To meet Marty please contact us at info@tucsoncoldwetnoses.com or you can fill out an application at tucsoncoldwetnoses.com.\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required.

He had 5 surgeries to try and save it but ultimately he had to have it amputated. \n\nDespite the hell he went through in his long-lost past life, Sawyer is such a joyful and happy boy! He is estimated about 3 years old. He had medium energy but LOVES to run around, he loves to swim, loves tennis balls, loves car rides, he loves other dogs and he loves kids! He is truly the happiest dog! (and he makes a great running buddy!)\n\nSawyer is a great listener, does great off-leash, he is curious, funny and can occupy himself easily with a bone! \n\nSawyer is excellent with kids, as you can see in the photos. We would recommend kids over 8 solely because how bounce and energetic he is around them!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sawyer, please apply at www.twotailzrescue.org!",

It typically takes 1 to 2 weeks. We only have 3 people working adoptions, and we are receiving 25 to 30 apps a day and hundreds of calls and inquiries, which slows the process for everyone. Adoption fee is $300.\n\nMeet our Mission 5. They were born around 12/04/2020. They got their 1st shot 01/12/2021 and will be getting fixed around 03/10/2021. They will be going to their new homes no later than 03/20/2021.\n\nMeet Claire (Chocolate Milk). She came in 01/14/2021 weighing 6.8 pounds. We anticipate she will weigh between 40 and 50 pounds full grown. All the puppies are well socialized and will make great companions. These pups should live to be 12 to 14 years old. If you are over 60, you will need to have a backup plan in place in the event you become unable to care for pup.",

Applications can be completed at www.adoggie4you.org. Please do not call to ask if the dog is available. It will stay posted until we have enough applications to find a match. It typically takes 1 to 2 weeks. We only have 3 people working adoptions, and we are receiving 25 to 30 apps a day and hundreds of calls and inquiries, which slows the process for everyone. Adoption fee is $300.\n\nMeet our Mission 5. They were born around 12/04/2020. They got their 1st shot 01/12/2021 and will be getting fixed around 03/10/2021. They will be going to their new homes no later than 03/20/2021.\n\nMeet Chika (Snowy). She came in 01/14/2021 weighing 6.0 pounds. We anticipate she will weigh between 40 and 50 pounds full grown. All the puppies are well socialized and will make great companions. These pups should live to be 12 to 14 years old. If you are over 60, you will need to have a backup plan in place in the event you become unable to care for pup.",

Over the past few months, she has undergone treatment for heartworm and has been recovering in her foster home where her activity was limited. Pumpkin had a good health report this week and is now allowed to slowly resume normal activity. She will need to be tested again in September 2021 to be sure that she is still heartworm free.Her list of skills include 'sit, down, heel' and she's working on 'leave it'. She doesn't steal food from countertops, and has no interest in getting on furniture. Pumpkin does like cuddling on the floor with her humans. Squeaky toys, soft toys and big bones to chew on are some of her favorite things. Pumpkin prefers cool weather. She hangs out near the air conditioner in the summer, and loves, loves, loves the snow! A home with small children will not be considered due to her size and never having lived with little ones.Pumpkin is up to date with vaccines, spayed, microchipped, and on flea/tick/heartworm preventative. Will Pumpkin be YOUR new best friend. She will love you forever!IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ\nClick here for the ADOPTION APPLICATION if you are interested in adopting this pet.\nApplications are the first step in the adoption process. Please do not call or email simply to express interest. We are all volunteers and receiving your application saves us time and helps to determine the best match for both people and dogs.\nWe provide as much information as we currently have on each dog in their description. For questions on the adoption process, including fees, please review the Adoption page. If you have additional questions or are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application. Once we receive your application someone will be in touch to answer your questions. We do not arrange visits to meet dogs without an application. If you'd like to meet a variety of dogs without filling out an application please attend one of our events, listed under the events link.\nThank you! 1/16/21 9:35 PM",

Sadie does have minor skin alleriges, however they are controlled through regular baths. Sadie does not prefer car rides, however she LOVES her comfy bed and her people. \n\nSadie has to find her new forever home because her current guardian rescued her from being euthanized but had no intentions to keep her and asked for our assistance to find her a permanent home. \n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo other dogs \n\tNo kids under 12\n\tDog experience \n\n\nPlease note, Sadie is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

Wylie is a cute little gentleman with the cutest underbite. He is happiest snuggled up on your lap or under the covers. While he does not seem to have any interest in toys, he has 2 babies that he likes to gently carry around with him from room to room. Good with baths, does not beg, potty trained, crate trained, walks beautifully on a leash, does not have any aggression, great with kids, and rarely barks. Seems to do well with other animals except birds which he finds scary once they take flight. But be aware that when he sleeps, he likes to tuck his nose into your shirt or under blankets. Wylie would make a fantastic family pet for just about any household. Wylie has been neutered, received a dental, is up to date on his vaccinations and is microchipped. If interested in meeting or adopting Wylie, please go to www.LOLR.org and fill out an adoption application.",

            "description": "Jamie here! I am estimated to be around a 1 year old pit bull mix and weight about 50 lbs. I have done well in my temporary foster home, I'm so so nice to the doggies I have met and very tolerant of my hyper foster brother! I have had no accidents in my foster home and I even sit by the door to let them know I need to go out! I am the BEST cuddler and wag my tail any time someone walks by. I do great with the 9 year old kid in my foster home and I love everyone, but a family with older kids would be best as I'm still a puppy and don't quite know my size. I can get excited on the leash when I see new friends, so I will need some continued guidance on walks. I know most basic commands and I even know how to shake! That one is my favorite as I already love to wave my paw at everyone to say hello. I haven't shown any interest in chewing things and can be trusted around the house. I need a family with a yard and active lifestyle that can include me in all their activities. I would also very much prefer to go to a home that has a playful doggie companion I can romp around with! I have the typical pitbull play style, so I would appreciate if my new doggie sibling enjoyed jumping and wrestling with me! I am spayed and current on rabies and DAPP vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $250 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

Cameron was found as a stray in a high kill shelter and scheduled to be euthanized when we rescued him. Cameron's current foster learned he isn't to fond of small children or big dogs as both scared him. Cameron did get along with puppies and older children. Cameron became very sick and was rushed off to the emergency vet. Cameron spent 11 days there recovering from what they thought was sepsis most likely related to a severe kidney infection. Cameron was severely dehydrated, lethargic with no appetite and loosing weight. They think Cameton might have diabetes insipidous but will know more after some more testing scheduled on January 20th. Cameron is now home with his foster family again and recovering amazingly. Cameron is eating like a champ, playing with his toys like a puppy and has not showed any signs of aggression. Cameron loves to go on walks, enjoys his crate and is house trained. Cameron is learning what doggy life with a family that loves you is suppose to be like. Once Cameron is healthy and has been cleared by the vet he will start his heart worm treatment. While going through Heart Worm treatment. We are hoping to find a forever family that can provide him a loving and healing environment. Cameron would do great in a home with a fenced in yard (fence required), older childreh, no cats or large dogs. Cameron is a very sweet boy who only wants to be loved and spoiled. If you are interested in adopting or meeting Cameron please go to our website at Charliescrusaders.org and fill out our adoption application.",

Otherwise, I may get bored and try to find my own adventure. Thankfully I love to go on long walks, hikes and camping. I don't do well with other dogs, I chase cats and I'm not ideal for homes wtih young kids as I like to jump a lot. I need a home with a 6ft fence and should be supervised when left outside. If you think we'd be a good fit, contact the shelter to meet with me!",

            "description": "My name is Red, and I am 6 years old. I am a very easy going and sweet boy. I am a lover of people and being around them.  In my foster home I enjoy being in the garden and watching the birds and chickens on the other side of the fence. I also like sleeping on my garden cot in the sun. I\u2019m not very fond of the rain. It makes my feet wet! I will go out to do my business, but after that I\u2019m right back inside.    I would like to be in a monogamous relationship with my person in regards to other dogs. I do have other foster dog siblings where I am now, but I\u2019ve never had a family of my very own, and I long to find a best friend and family who will just hang out with me, play with me and love me. I know several tricks like sit and stay in place, and I walk nicely on leash.  My foster mom says I am very smart and eager to please, so maybe you can teach me even more fun stuff. I may have been left alone for long periods in the past because I prefer not to stay home alone for long periods.  I\u2019m okay for around 6 hours without problem, but if you are gone for long periods I worry you are never coming back and get anxious.  I have a nice low energy level and I like a calm environment, so if you are a bit of a couch potato, we might be a perfect match. I\u2019d be happy to hang out with you on the sofa watching movies or sitting on the floor in the kitchen while you cook. I\u2019ll clean anything up you drop on the floor. I am super easy once I learn my routine. My foster mom says I am a pleasure to be around, and I bond with people very fast.  I am a good boy and am hoping I get a family of my very own soon who will love me, play with me and give me the attention I so enjoy. In return you will get the most loyal and loving friend you ever had! Check out my pictures too, I\u2019m pretty adorable!  If you want to know more about me or meet me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at: martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com, irinad@english-russian.us or (510) 697-0072. \n\nLove, Red\n\nApplication, home check and adoption fee required.",

I am about 4 yrs old and weigh 8 lbs.\n\nI am definitely looking for a furry buddy/best friend. I need a home with another dog that likes to wrestle and play. My foster mom thinks a dog bigger than me would be best, since sometimes I get excited while playing, and a bigger dog\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 means more than a small dog\u2019s \u201cno\u201d. We haven\u2019t had any problems playing too hard, and I am learning to be extra gentle, just for good manners. If you have a dog that likes to run and play outside, I would really like to join in the fun!\n\nMy foster mom has been working with me on my potty training and walking on a leash, but I still have some training to be done. I am learning so much, but it is taking me a while to learn how to be the best dog ever! It seems no one really cared for me before, but now I have a chance at having a family to love. I need someone who is patient and has the time to spend with me so I can continue learning, but it will pay off in a lifetime of love!!\n\nIf you think you and I would be a great match, please fill out an application.  My foster mom is just waiting to give you a call so she can tell you more about me.\n",

I am 7 years old but I have the soul of a pup. Why am I so happy you ask? Well let me tell you my whole story. I started out as an outside dog in a old stinky pen. No one really bothered to play with me or wanted to love me. They just wanted me to have puppies. Well they did not give me good medicine to keep me healthy and I caught the heart worm, nasty worm! But that's all old news now, Woooo Wooooo My Foster Mom and the wonderful folks at Because You Care have helped me get better, and I am free of those nasty old critters. It has taken a long time but I'm all healthy now! I am loved , and I play, and I am the happiest beagle in the whole wide world. Wooooo Wooooo! So... I'm smart and I'm house trained, and crate trained (but I love sleeping in a snuggly bed). I like other dogs, not so much with cats, they run and I just want to case, I just can't help myself. I love people! I love kisses and belly rubs, and treats and walks and naps. So if you are ready for the happiest pup in the world then look e up That's me Penny Beagle.\n\nPenny's adoption fee is $200 which includes her spay, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, lepto), microchip, heartworm test and flea and heartworm prevention. Also, six weeks of obedience classes if you chose to do so.\n\nDUE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS: TO HELP US LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING, OUR ADOPTION CENTER IS OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY TO APPROVED APPLICANTS. PLEASE FILL OUT THE ADOPTION APPLICATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET PENNY. FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE YOU TO ADOPT.",

We are not a shelter, it doesn't mean we've met or evaluated the dog, it means we are trying to help this owner find a good, responsible and most of all a loving home.\n\nCourtesy Post\u00a0for Owner:\u00a0\nBelow is what was written or told to us:\nBella is a 4 1/2-year-old female hound mix. She is spayed and up-to-date on her shots. Bella weighs about 40 pounds.\nWe adopted her in 2017 and about a year ago she started fighting with our other female dog in the house.\n\nShe is currently on anxiety medication for her shaking and hiding before and during storms, fireworks and any loud noises.  The vet thought it would help with her behavior towards our other female dog.  She needs to be the only pet in the home.  She has not been around small children but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it due to her anxiety.\n\nBella enjoys car rides, she does pretty well on a leash but I would recommend a harness. She loves to play with toys.\u00a0\n\nIt takes her a little bit to warm up to new people but when she does she is the sweetest thing.\u00a0\n\nShe loves to cuddle and sleep in bed with us.\u00a0\n\nIf you would like to adopt this dog please fill out the adoption application: https://www.dogshope.com/adoption_application2.html\n",

Storm loves running and will require a lot of daily exercise. Her current foster mom walks her three miles a day. She says if she gets adequate exercise, Storm is behaved and non destructive. Storm is very smart and highly motivated by both food and toys. Since joining us, Storm has participated in training programs. She knows all of her basic commands, she is pretty decent with her recall but needs continued practice and training. She is focused but still gets distracted. Her is house and crate trained. She gets along with other dogs, although not dominant she should not be placed with another dog that may have behavioral issues or is dominant themselves. She will join in on the trouble making. Storm is a super star with people! She has shown no good aggression but has shown us some resource guarding. That is something is is continuously addressed and worked on daily.",

Sandy is very active and will require a lot of exercise. Her foster mom walks her and her sister, Storm, three miles a day. She says with adequate exercise, sandy remains non destructive. She has been going through training since she has joined us and now knows all of her basic commands. She is pretty good at recall but still needs a little practice. Her focus is good, but can still be distracted. She is very good and you motivated and super smart! But most important, this girl LOVES to run! It would benefit her to have a fenced in yard, preferably a six foot fence. Sandy cannot be placed in a home with another dog that has behavioral problems, she is a follower and will join in on the antics. She has had zero food aggression it has displayed some resource guarding which is addressed daily and getting better.",

            "description": "Meet Bella!\n\n10-year-old Bella became a Frosted Faces\n\non January 13th\n\nthrough our Final Wish program. Bella had recently been diagnosed with diabetes and was unwell. Her elderly owner, who has deeply loved and cared for Bella since she was a puppy, didn't feel that she could manage the care Bella needed and made the difficult decision to relinquish her to us. After taking Bella to our vet to be evaluated, we started her on insulin and are monitoring her blood sugar with a glucometer. She is doing great! Bella is eating with gusto and has gobs of energy for uppies and kisses. Bella is such a friendly and sweet girl, and it is very easy to give her the injections.\n\nBella lives in a Foster Home (with a veterinary student!) and is getting extra TLC as we monitor her blood sugar levels to ensure her diabetes is well managed. We've heard from her Foster Mom that Bella has settled right in! She shared, \"Bella sure knows how to make herself right at home! She is the most cuddly pup on the planet! Here's what I've learned about Bella so far: She has the most manners! She will paw you when she wants attention and wait patiently until your ready for pets. She is so respectful of other dogs space! She definitely greets my chihuahua every morning or in passing but totally gives her her space. Bella loves to greet all house guests. She never makes a peep or barks when people enter my home. She will wiggle her tail and make way to their lap and cuddle. She is truly the most perfect dog on the planet. Her diabetes is SO manageable because she loves her food and doesn't mind her insulin shots. We have her on a prescription diabetic diet, and she LOOOVES it. She has been such a champ about receiving her insulin vaccines, doesn't even make a peep!\"\n\nIf you have experience with diabetes or want to learn, don't shy away from being Bella's mom or dad! We ask that you would be open to communicating with her previous mom about how Bella is doing and maybe even visit! Please apply at\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply/\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/20/21 KG",

She has been through a lot in her 7 years but that does not stop her from being extremely HAPPY! She loves every person she meets. She knows basic commands.. sit, stay, off, sit pretty and does not mind her crate at all. She came into Misfits after a 4 month stay at Saginaw Animal Control.  Betsy had a large growth on her gums that we had removed 1-4-2021. She is still learning a few things like how to cuddle, some leash manners and not to run out an open door.  She is a very confident girl and did I mention HAPPY?!  Her favorite toys are stuffed toys, nylabones and TENNIS BALLS (that's her favorite). She would do best in a home without other animals and kids 15 years and older. Spayed, current on all vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped!

            "description": "\u2022\u2022 Our shelter will be open this Sunday, January 24 from Noon to 2pm. Come see us! **\n\nJunior is a darling Pit Bull mix! He\u2019s 2 years old and he weighs 54 lbss.  Junior looks pretty serious in his photos\u2014 but he\u2019s actually just staring down a treat!  He\u2019s very playful and silly and goofy, but as soon as the treats came out, all playing stopped and all of his focus was on the treat!  \n\nObviously, he\u2019s very food motivated (you do have to watch your fingers, though. He needs work on taking treats gently).  \n\nJunior is good with other dogs and plays in play groups. \n\nHe has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  \n\nAdoption hours at our shelter: Monday - Friday 9am-4pm, BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and some weekend hours.  To make an appointment or for more information, please call us at 913-321-1445.  If you have a dog, you can also arrange to bring your dog with you to meet our dogs to see if it's a good match.\n\nOur dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older).\n\nVisit our Petfinder home page at http://kckac.petfinder.com for more info about adopting our pets.",

He is smart and picking them up quickly. He loves people and other dogs. Has the cutest floppy, polka dotted ears! He is going to make such a great companion for a lucky family.\n\nThese puppies are the best, most adorable and smartest pups I have fostered. Adorable litter of lab pups. Mom found as stray and gave birth to 7 pups shortly after she was rescued.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

He is already housebroken, but due to his size, strength and energy level, he is recommended for families with teens and adults.\n\nHe does have some dog friends at the kennel, so he could go to a home with another dog based on their compatibility.\n\nHe is very healthy, neutered, de-wormed, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped, heartworm tested negative, and on monthly heartworm preventative. \n\nHis adoption fee of $150 benefits the rescued dogs of Pei Land Rescue in Plano, Illinois.\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt Cliff, please contact Jen at peachesash@aol.com or 630-553-7829. \n\nCliff has spent as entire year in the kennel waiting for adoption.\n",

My owner of just 3 months surrendered me because he felt that he did not have the ability to provide the proper conditions for me to live my best hound life. I love ALL people and have lived in harmony with both male and female dogs. I have also spent a lot of time with children and I play well with them. I am very friendly and playful, but tend to be more gentle and submissive. I shouldn't be placed in a home with cats, as they are not my favorite and may incite my very strong prey drive. I am known for my typical hound-like hunting skills with rabbits and squirrels. I like to go for car rides and play with rope/squeaky toys. I am also afraid of thunder and lightening. I would be a great fit for an experienced hound owner and would love to have a great big space to run around and explore. I would benefit from some further training, as I am not quite potty-trained yet.",

Remy was thrown from his owners car and pictures show him trying to get back in?But that sad time in his life is behind him and we\u2019re so glad he\u2019s a Lucky Mutt! Remy enjoys fetch, walks, car rides, wearing sweaters, sharing chicken nuggets, and napping alongside you while you watch TV on the sofa. He is eager to please and loves to give kisses. He is crate trained and housebroken (but still a puppy, so learning). Remy gets along with bigger dogs and older kids. Untested on cats, small dogs. He would do best in a home without young children because he doesn\u2019t always know his own strength when he plays.

He is always so happy and is rarely seen without his tail wagging - unless he is sprawled out for a nap. He is dog friendly and loves to play with other dogs. He loves the water, playing with toys, and just wants to have fun! He is potty trained, walking well on the leash (although he can get a bit excited to see other dogs!) , and is truly a stellar dog. ?With some continued structure and basic training, Walter will make an amazing family pet and will add so much life & love into a home. He is healthy, neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.\n?",

When he first arrived at his foster his body stayed rigid and tense for some time. Boo has mostly likely never known kind hands. \n\nIn the past month he has been in a foster home and has made STRIDES!! Boo is learning how to be a loved family pet and is learning rules of the house! He is house trained and crate trained and hasn\u2019t displayed any separation anxieties. \n\nBoo has learned some basic commands like WAIT, and KENNEL. He does struggle with SIT, but it is believed that sitting somehow makes him feel vulnerable or uncomfortable. Even on his own, Boo chooses not to sit most of the time. He prefers to either stand or lay down. \n\nBoo walks great on a leash and only requires slight corrections most of the time. He gets along great with other dogs and is very playful! \n\nBoo would do well with another playful canine companion! Car rides do make Boo nervous, but he is getting more comfortable with them. Riding with a trusted companion seems to ease his nerved.\n\nBoo loves to chew on his bones and other toys. He also loves to run and play outside! He requires exercise, whether it is playtime during the day or daily walks.\n\nBoo is ready for a furever home!\n",

I am a bit shy when we first meet however I soon become your best friend.  I love to run and play outside with my foster pup friends. I came into rescue with my 4 babies, I was a wonderful mother.  All have been adopted and now it's my turn. I need a home that will be patient with me as I learn the new routine.  I am a quiet soul that startles easy, whip smart and athletic (I can literally climb out of any enclosure....it's how I got a little peace from my kids) however I was never destructive when I got out of our play pen. \nMy previous owner was careless and didn't have me on consistent heart worm prevention and I have tested mild positive for heart worms. I have no clinical symptoms and have already been started on treatment. \nAdoption fee is $225 it includes spay/neuter, annual vaccinations, rabies license, microchip, dewormer, heart worm preventative for the month, vet exam.  Please go like our Facebook page at  http://www.facebook.com/barkandroll .  Follow us on  instagram/twitter @barkandrollrc to see more pictures of me as well as other dogs in our rescue.  You can access an adoption application on our website http://www.barkandrollrescuecompanions.com  It usually take 1-2 days to complete the application process.",

It causes her no pain and she is overall healthy but it is noticeable in person and makes her even more cute!\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out an adoption application located on our website!

            "description": "Meet Lola a gorgeous 1.5 year old American Staffordshire Terrier Mix (breed is just a guess) who weighs in at 65 lbs. Lola is a sweet girl who loves to go for walks, go on car rides and hang out with her humans. Lola is an expert at giving doggie kisses and snuggles. Lola is a happy and goofy girl who loves to play with her doggie toys, roll around in the grass and follow her foster mom wherever she goes. Lola would do best in a home where someone is at home a good portion of the day, even after COVID. Lola enjoys her daily walks, but seems to need the freedom of being off leash in a fenced-in backyard. Lola is a social girl and loves to meet people and other dogs. If there are kids in Lola's home, they should be 8 years and up as Lola is not in a foster home with children. Lola needs an adopter who has recent large dog experience. Lola is not suited to apartment/condo living. She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines, and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nIf you would like to meet Lola, please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com\n\nIf you are viewing this on PetFinder or other venue, please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Beans, and I am a 9 year old loving girl.  My owner is losing our home, and I am sad because I will be losing both my family and my home. I am a 60 lb bundle of adorable love as you can see from my pictures. I prefer a monogamous relationship with my person without other dogs, animals or kids that I might have to share my person/s with. At my age I like to be queen of my castle. I love to cuddle and be right by your side. I love rubber toys, rope toys and getting my aerobic exercise chasing the laser pointer. I tire pretty quickly after that, so if you're a bit of a couch potato, I may be the perfect girl for you. I walk nicely on leash and am great at sit and stay. I would love a home with a backyard to play in. I'm a bit sensitive to some noises like thunder and fire alarms and get all shaky, but I'm easily comforted being swaddled in a blanket or being close to my person. I also feel safe in my crate. One of my favorite treats is peanut butter and salmon. Together is even better. Peanut butter in a Kong works too for a special treat. I'm in great health overall. I do have some allergies that are easily treated, I'm up to date on shots and all my vet records are available. My owner will provide my two beds, large crate, several toys, food bowls, leash, harness and muzzle. I'm very sad about losing my family, but am hopeful someone is looking for a loyal companion to experience life with that will give me the love I am losing. If you want to know more about me or meet me in person, please contact martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com  Love, Beans\n\nApplication, home check and adoption fee required.",

She is spayed now, but has been over bred in the past.\u00a0\n\nRoxie faces a few challenges; she has exhibited some neurological damage, and her back end doesn\u2019t work as well as it should. Her stride wobbles in the rear and she has a tendency to slide her back feet on the floor. She has occasional accidents that she doesn\u2019t know is happening. She has less feeling back there and tends to bite her feet.\u00a0\n\nShe doesn\u2019t appear to like other dogs, and would enjoy being an only dog. We have not observed her with other pets so we can\u2019t speak to her inter-specie behavior.\u00a0\n\nRoxie is a very sweet and very loving girl, she is a true lap dog. Her favorite toys are squeaky toys that she will squeak until they stop. Roxie doesn\u2019t bark a lot, but she does have an adorable snore.\u00a0\n\nShe is crate trained. Roxie would perfectly fit in a home with lots of patience, love and attention. She is truly a delightful girl.\u00a0\n\nShe is spayed, UTD on shots, HW neg and on HW prevention.Her adoption donation is $250.00.\n\nIf you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application. The link for the application is below.\n\nTo submit an application go here\u2026\u2026chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/An application must be submitted and approved before a meet-n-greet can be scheduled.\n\nYour current dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered unless a veterinarian has determined that your current pet(s) should not be fixed due to medical reasons. \n\nThey must also be up-to-date on shots and on HW preventative.Reference checks and a home visit are required so SE dogs can only be adopted in NC/SC, VA, TN, AL, MD and GA.",

            "description": "Meet Hazel! This pretty bully girl with snow white coat and adorable markings was found running as a stray in rural SC. Animal control was notified, and no one came looking for her. She was not spayed or microchipped and is still a very young pup. She has pretty good social skills and was heartworm negative on intake, so we believe she'd been living inside a home as part of a family.\n\nHazel has been in her SC foster home almost a week now, and is being fostered in a home with 4 other large dogs. She does great as part of the pack and loves to play. She was introduced first to the most selective dog in the home, Clarysse, who took to Hazel right away, and they were instant buddies. If Clarysse approves of you, the rest of the pack does too.\n\nWhile Hazel was a little timid at first after coming into a new home, she quickly settled in. She is crate trained, housetrained, and has a medium energy level. She loves stuffed critters, loves to play, and really enjoys the company of other dogs. While she's good with people, Hazel would rather be playing with a dog, so having a dog playmate in her next home is a priority.\n\nHer foster mom describes her as very sweet and puppyish in her ways. She's working on her leash walking skills in her foster home and learning basic commands. We think Hazel will make a great family dog and pup companion. She will be making her way to N. VA in early February.\n\nMore updates to follow as we learn more about this adorable, fun pup.\n\n***Preference will be given to homes with another young playful pup, and some large dog or bully breed experience***\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: AmStaff/Pointer mix\nGENDER: Female\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 48 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 1 year old\nCOAT TYPE: Short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/spayed/microchipped/\nLOCATION: Rock Hill, SC\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

He is great with cats, dogs of all sizes, and kids, too!\n\nWe exited Cider knowing he had what looked like a handful of mast cell tumors on the back of his leg, but the whole inside of his thigh is also thick tumorous metastasis. We discussed many surgical options with our wonderful vet, Dr. Savides at College Animal Hospital and what is best for Cider and his quality of life. We decided on the only really viable option - removing the ulcerated mass on his leg to alleviate the discomfort and risk of infection.\n\nCider is the sweetest, best boy! T\n\nhankfully, he is living in a foster home and getting lots of TLC following surgery, but we still want to find Cider a family of his own for the rest of his days.\n\nMight that be you?

No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/27/21 KG",

            "description": "Special needs\nRosie is a sweetheart miniature poodle. She is only four, but she has epilepsy, and thus she needs someone who can care for her in special ways. She is beautiful with a heart-shaped nose. Rosie loves walks and being close with her people. She is a friendly, playful dog, and she gets along well with everyone. She is not timid or afraid of new people or situations. Rosie is generally quiet at home and enjoys naps on the couch. She has to be let out every 2-3 hours due to a frequent need to do her jobs, so she would do best with a family who could provide her with regular access to a safe, fenced-in yard, but she is not an outdoor dog. Rosie is more of a lap dog. Rosie is a good companion even though the anti-seizure medications have caused her to be less lively and interactive than before. She has been taking medication for almost 2 years now. Another side-effect of the medication is that Rosie is always hungry, so her diet needs to be well managed too. Rosie is 16 lbs. The main challenge is that Rosie continues to experience seizure episodes at times, and when this happens, on her worst days, she becomes disoriented, unaware of who her family is, and unable to control her own body functions. Currently, Rosie gets 32.5 mg of phenobarbital twice a day. The medication lessens the seizure frequency, intensity, and duration, but the seizures still occur. A new owner needs to be able to handle this and be aware that the episodes sometimes occur at night, and that Rosie occasionally may get up at night and need to go out to urinate. Fortunately, Rosie has more good days than bad days, but she needs a family that can care for her with compassion, health awareness, and schedule flexibility. Rosie is easy to love and hopes to find a family that can make her life happy and comfortable. Coat: Medium-length, white, curly, non-shedding, hypo-allergenic. House-trained: Yes, but prone to accidents \u2013 needs frequent opportunities to go out. Health: Has special needs to monitor medications and diet due to seizure episodes. Good in a home with: Other dogs and children. Not used to cats. Birthdate: 10/2016",

            "special_needs_notes": "Rosie is a sweetheart miniature poodle. She is only four, but she has epilepsy, and thus she needs someone who can care for her in special ways. She is beautiful with a heart-shaped nose. Rosie loves walks and being close with her people. She is a friendly, playful dog, and she gets along well with everyone. She is not timid or afraid of new people or situations. Rosie is generally quiet at home and enjoys naps on the couch. She has to be let out every 2-3 hours due to a frequent need to do her jobs, so she would do best with a family who could provide her with regular access to a safe, fenced-in yard, but she is not an outdoor dog. Rosie is more of a lap dog.\n\n \n\nRosie is a good companion even though the anti-seizure medications have caused her to be less lively and interactive than before. She has been taking medication for almost 2 years now. Another side-effect of the medication is that Rosie is always hungry, so her diet needs to be well managed too. Rosie is 16 lbs. The main challenge is that Rosie continues to experience seizure episodes at times, and when this happens, on her worst days, she becomes disoriented, unaware of who her family is, and unable to control her own body functions. Currently, Rosie gets 32.5 mg of phenobarbital twice a day. The medication lessens the seizure frequency, intensity, and duration, but the seizures still occur. A new owner needs to be able to handle this and be aware that the episodes sometimes occur at night, and that Rosie occasionally may get up at night and need to go out to urinate. Fortunately, Rosie has more good days than bad days, but she needs a family that can care for her with compassion, health awareness, and schedule flexibility.\nRosie is easy to love and hopes to find a family that can make her life happy and comfortable.\n\nCoat: Medium-length, white, curly, non-shedding, hypo-allergenic.\n\nHouse-trained: Yes, but prone to accidents \u2013 needs frequent opportunities to go out.\n\nHealth: Has special needs to monitor medications and diet due to seizure episodes.\n\nGood in a home with: Other dogs and children. Not used to cats. \n\nBirthdate: 10/2016",

Possible that some were rough with him  or/and maybe some background of punishment in there. \nBut he would do best with older kids, 14 and above, who have experience with large breed dogs. \n\nNew faces take him a few minutes to accept into foster home. When he mouths he plays well, never broke skin or fabric. He has a noticeably clean teeth and gums. For a large doge he doesn\u2019t carry much of a scent. \n\nHis first night was anxious, needing lots of attention until around 9pm, he sleeps exceptionally well alone in a padded open crate with the door open, not afraid of kennels. \nHanni prefers his spot very close to humans most the time, and finding dry spots to sunbathe on. He can sleep several hours undisturbed. He likes dog parks, and he knows a few tricks like sit, lay down, come, & had no accidents in the house. He\u2019s non aggressive with food.\n\nHe has done good when tested with cats, however his foster home does not have cats, so introductions need to be slow and patient. \n\nHanni is about 18 months old, neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. He is kept on heartworm and flea preventatives.  \n\nHis adoption fee includes his cost of transport from Texas to any out of state adopter. \n\nTo meet this sweet boy via facetime or in person, please send an application via www.savesomesouls.com",

Experienced dog owners are encouraged for her. Her company will be more than reward for the extra guidance she will need.\n\nWe know there are some 3rd party websites giving mis-information on the location of the pet you may be interested in.

            "description": "Tony is a gorgeous Husky boy who came into a rural shelter as a stray but has been rescued by 11th Hour. He is about 2 years old, weighing about 65 pounds and has 2 different colored eyes!!.\n\nTony is a super sweet guy who is friendly with other dogs, but is a no go for cats. We don't think he has ever lived with kids, so older ones who have dog experience would be best. He also needs a lot of training and structure, something he has missed out on in his life. Tony has a lot of energy but walks pretty well on a leash. He would really like to have a fenced-in yard because he likes to go, go, go, but anything under 6ft won't keep him in. Huskies are an active breed who need plenty of exercise, and breed experience is preferred.\n\nIf you are interested in Tony, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to ask for him by name, TONY SCAS!",

Although Flurry loves everyone he meets, he is uncomfortable for some handling and would do best in a home with teens and up. Flurry has gotten along with the other dogs here at the shelter, but should meet new canine companions one-on-one to ensure they are a good match. Like all dogs, Flurry would benefit from positive, reward-based training classes to help him be the best he can be! This pup will require guidance and supervision learning to use the bathroom outside only, but our staff can give you tips to help with this.",

About 50 pounds right now and is spayed.\nAs is typical with a young Husky, she is very high energy and needs an active household with no small children. Teenagers would be a good age for her.  Lucy needs a 6 foot fully fenced yard and LOTS of exercise. Applicants with Husky experience or first hand knowledge of similar breeds will be prioritized.\n\nWe also think Lucy would benefit from another active dog in the household if we can find the right fit through the meet and greet process. She can be dog reactive so we will likely need more than one meetup to be sure if will work out. We have not cat tested Lucy but we suspect she will not be a good fit with them.\n\nIf you have the experience described, you can meet Lucy on Saturdays from 10-2 at 809 Rockford Rd SW.\n\n",

We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals.The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me? Click here to fill out an application!Happy Tails Rescue Minnesota is located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley MN 55432. We are open for adoption events from 12-5 every Sunday. If there is a certain animal you want to meet at one the events please fill out a preadoption application to directly contact their foster family or check our Facebook page to see if they will be there! Their event attendance is based on the availability of their foster family.\nHome visits (video tours or in person) are required for all dog adoptions.

She just loves people and will crawl into your lap if you let her. Benni is active and eager to please. With the help of our volunteers she is learning a few commands and to walk well on leash. Benni is a fun girl and would be a greyt hiking buddy. Benni came to us from South Korea and her 'greyhound' background is a little questionable, but she makes up for it in how loving and delightful she is. Benni is not suitable for an apartment/condo/townhome and will need a home without cats.\nSponsored by Kristy Spray\nBenni would love to have a sponsor until she gets adopted. Can that be you? If so, see: https://www.greyhoundpetsinc.org/support/sponsor-a-dog/\nGreyhound Pets, Inc. - www.greyhoundpetsinc.org - 877-468-7681\nWHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT A GREYHOUND?\nRead Greyhound Pets, Inc.

He loves his walks with our volunteers. Dino has lived in a home before and was returned for some issues that we are happy to discuss and fully disclose to potential adopters. Since he has been back with us, he has had a much needed dental (so his mouth feels sooooo much better), been started on some meds, and been going on walks with our volunteers, and hanging out in our dog park with our volunteers. He loves to run in the dog park and has been a gentle, mellow guy. We feel he would do best in a quieter, dog experienced home with a fenced yard. Children make him nervous, so a home without children would be best.\nSponsored by Sharon Fitzgerald\nSponsored by Ethan Mayer\nCan't adopt right now but you'd still like to help?

            "description": "Location Valley Center, CA\n(If this ad is running the dog Is available!)\nDenali is the happiest and one good looking husky boy who has endured a life of neglect. \nWe picked him up from a high kill shelter in the most Deplorable condition. His fur was receding, he was disoriented and not eating. Several tests revealed Cushing\u2019 disease. He went on a treatment as he started to feel better day after day. He now has a great appetite, is very active and never stops smiling. He does have to take his daily meds which we cut to a minimal as he is showing good progress. \nDenali is about 5-6yo, neutered male. He Loves his walks/ runs and lounge outdoors. He has no problems with other dogs. (Cats unknown.) \nHe is very active to say the least, and is full of life. We are looking for a caring family for him who could take him in to continue his daily regiment and help this boy to have a life he never knew. \nAffection is new to him, he is submissive and loves his hugs. \nSaving this sweet boy was the most rewarding experience. And we are hoping he can now transition to a private residence living to continue his new journey in life. \nHis new fur is growing out slowly but surely, although still lots of patches of missing fur. \nHe would do best in a home with a decent yard as he Loves to lounge outdoors but is always eager to come inside and sleep on his soft blankets. He would also do best with someone who has time to spend with him and is experienced with special needs pets. \nWe are hopeful that a kind family is out there to take over what we have started to turn his life around. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf you are interested in Denali please respond with detailed information about your home and family starting with location, age, other pets, other occupants and ages, yard and fencing. \n(No apartments please.) \nThank you.",

Then we introduced him to Joy, and it was love at first sight! George perked right up, became more confident and wanted to play almost immediately. It would be great for George to be adopted into a home where he has a playful canine friend to help him feel more comfortable and confident. George would do best in a child free home. An ideal guardian for George is someone with patience and experience with shy dogs.\n\nPlease call (707) 467-6453 if you are interested in scheduling an appointment to meet George.",

Don't worry though, I already mastered taking fabulous pictures and my ear flop is always on point!\n\nAge: 1 year old\nBreed: Pitbull Mix\nNeutered: No\nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Piglet please foster@cofpets.com.",

He was rescued from Okeechobee Animal Control by Nala's New Life Rescue. When we pulled dogs from the shelter in November,  Brantley had been there for some time and had lost his spirit, you could see it in his eyes. Barbi promised him Nala's would not forget him and here he is! He is extremely happy and grateful to be at our ranch. Brantley is great with other dogs and loves people. He is housebroken and will make a wonderful companion or family pet.To adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 30 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to ensure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

For more photos of Ram, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgRam. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Lulu is 1.5 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Lulu is good with people and other dogs. Lulu is a beautiful girl who deserves way more than the life she has had thus far. We found Lulu in a kill shelter in a devastatingly emaciated condition. To make matters worse, Lulu was trying to care for a litter of puppies while she herself was starving. One by one her puppies passed away until she only had 4 left. That's when Rescue Dogs Rock NYC stepped in and quickly scooped Lulu and her pups out of that shelter and brought them to our veterinary partner where Lulu is receiving all of the medical care she requires. Lulu is amazing sweet, but understandably a bit scared at the life she has experienced. That life is over, and Lulu now needs a forever family who can show her how happy life can be. If you can replace Lulu's sad memories with fantastic memories, please apply online to adopt Lulu (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

His foster dad said that he makes progress every day. So far, it's been learned that he's house trained and hasn't destroyed anything when left outside of the crate.\nNaveen's foster can only keep him for a couple more weeks. We really don't want him to come back to the shelter and regress. He needs a new foster or an adopter who can continue to help him gain his confidence. He's a loving boy who has been lower energy in the foster home.\n2.10 y/o, 60 pounds, C O M P A N I O N\nDogs: friendly\nCats: unknown\nKids: unknown",

Our veterinary partner states that previous chip info registers Skylar DOB as Feb 5, 2009 . Skylar is good with people and other dogs and BONUS even likes cats!. At her age, beautiful Skylar should be enjoying life in a comfortable, happy forever home, but instead, she's sick, homeless and starting over in life. Don't worry, though, as Rescue Dogs Rock NYC has Skylar's back and we will see to it that Skylar gets all the medical care she requires and ends up in the best home she has ever had. And this time her home will be forever. Skylar is a very sweet girl who is currently being treated for pneumonia. She also has mega-esophagus. We would like to have Skylar's forever home waiting for her when she's ready to start her new life. If you are that special person who can open your heart and home to this senior lady, please apply online to adopt Skylar (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Koda is a big boy at 94 pounds and will pull while on leash in his excitement to get out to the doggie play yard, where he loves to run and play. Koda has lived with children previously, but a home with older children would be best since he does tend to jump up sometimes and can knock over little ones. We are told that he will chase cats and would be best in a home with no other dogs so he could have all of the attention and love for himself. If interested in Koda, please email the canine department at Jrein@carrollcountymd.gov to request an application for adoption be sent to you which is required. Koda's adoption fee is $150. which includes microchip, Heartworm and Lyme tested, he is neutered and current on vaccines per shelter protocol.",

She likes to be active, enjoys a good game of fetch and any other activity that will wear her out. Rey has had in-home training to curb her enthusiasm and make her a well-behaved girl. Do you have extra Amazon boxes from the holidays? Perfect! One of Rey's favorite hobbies is shredding cardboard. What better way to recycle! Once she's had enough activity for the day, she is a totally sweet and loves to cuddle. This girl is so ready of any adventure!\n\nRey can be possessive with her toys and food and prefers to be the only dog so she can have all the attention.\n\nPlease consider opening your home to Rey. This sweet, active girl is waiting for you (and your Amazon boxes)!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

No one in the family was able to keep him. \n\nI think he is a Chow/Border Collie (or Aussie) mix. He holds his tail and has ears like a chow. \n\nCharlie has only been with us a few days, we have figured out he is a very sweet boy, loves attention, does well with other dogs (but does try to be the boss) he tried to play with one of the staff members dog once he was comfortable. He didn't seem to mind the clinic cat either. \n\nHe hasn't had an accident in his kennel and appears that he is housebroken. But he did mark once or twice while in the office (there are lots of smells here). He approached everyone with a wagging tail and was excited to be out of the kennel. He even said hi to a little girl and licked her hands and face. \n\nIf interested in Charlie please send an email to hoisingtonvet@gmail.com",

He has a high prey instinct and therefore is not good with cats. He will make a great family dog; he is housebroken, knows his basic commands (sit, lie down, stay, and give paw) when motivated with treats. Cooper is sweet and calm with a low to moderate activity level. He enjoys walks but will pull hard if he sees a cat, squirrel, deer, etc. He would love to have a home with a fenced back yard to explore. Cooper has been fully vetted, is neutered, and is up to date on his vaccinations. To adopt Cooper please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application.\n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

When we tested her with other dogs she just seemed scared but did okay with the other dogs. If you have other dogs we do ask you to bring them to meet her to make sure they get along before adopting. \n\nCoco is one of the sweetest dogs you'll meet! She has come a long way since being here at the shelter where at first she didn't even want us touching her. Now that's all she wants! She loves to be with you and will come over to lay in your lap with you. She loves affection and loves giving you kisses! She is laid back for the most part and wouldn't mind just snuggling up with you. She is also housebroken and will try to wait to go potty outside. \n\nCoco is a 1.5-year-old female Labrador Retriever mix that weighs 57 pounds. She will be spayed and microchipped before going home and will stay at the shelter until she is spayed. She is current on her vaccinations, flea, and parasite prevention.",

He requires a house without children, cats and NEEDS A FENCED IN YARD, to keep him safe and secure! He gets along well with other dogs with proper introductions. He will require continued training for meeting new people! He would benefit from obedience training. He is working on potty training and working on crate training. \n\nMidnight is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. Midnight is neutered and is microchipped.

            "description": "Willow is a precious puppy who is a part of a litter of 5 who were all saved from a local kill shelter. Currently weighing 35 pounds, her estimated date of birth is August 20, 2020. This pup has a gorgeous, soft black coat with tons of white on her chin, chest and belly and even a little white stripe down her face! Willow is perfectly crate trained and sleeps on an extra large orthopedic bed. If given the opportunity, Willow would house train VERY quickly given that she is so wonderful about her potty schedule. Friendly & sweet, Willow loves everyone she meets. She is used to being crated at night and playing in a safe, fenced yard during the day with other pups. Willow is awesome with other dogs and will be fine with cats and other animals if introduced as a puppy. Eager to please, Willow is smart. She learns quickly and, although she has only been worked with a handful of times, she already knows come, sit, down, over and is learning paw. Willow is now healthy, fully vetted and ready for her forever home. Her wish list consists of an inside forever home with a big fenced yard for playtime, a home with lots of toys and another doggy friend for play time and pet parents who understand the time commitment that a puppy requires. Adopters who are retired or work-from-home parents are ideal as they have the time to spend with the pet. Adopters committed to doing a 6 week basic obedience class to ensure Willow's continued success at being a good canine citizen would also a plus (and to ensure the new puppy parent's education level). If you think you have the perfect home for Willow, contact us at info.caresga@gmail.com for an adoption application. We adopt up north and all over so please ask for details. $400 adoption fee and a vet reference is required to ensure a great home (this means you have had a pet so we can call to verify their level of care). Eligibility for adoption means your current or past pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Please be aware that we do not allow shock collars (ie underground fences) or \"pens\" as an alternative for a fenced yard.\n\nWe do our best to place our rescue pets in the very best homes. Please be aware that we have an application which also includes required vet records showing your existing pets are current on preventative medical care. Puppy adopters please take note that we generally try to place our puppies into homes where at least one parent is retired/stay at home/works from home to ensure the puppy gets enough attention and training (puppies cannot hold it all day in a crate) so please have a plan ready when contacting us. For safety reasons, we try not to place small dogs or puppies in families with children under 5 (there may be exceptions depending on situation).\n\nTypical adoption fees for puppies are $350, juvenile dogs $300, adults dogs are $250, senior dogs are $150. Some pets, smaller dogs for example, may have a higher than normal adoption fee but we will alert you if there is a variance. Dogs rescued from China always have a higher adoption fee. Adoption fees help our group offset PART of the cost of rescuing, rehabilitating, and getting the pet healthy so they can go on to find a loving home with someone willing to give them a second chance at life. This amount includes each animal being current on age appropriate vaccinations including DHPPL, bordetella, influenza, rabies, and boosters when appropriate. De-wormed for any internal parasites (round worms, hook worms, tape worms and whipworms) with Drontal Plus, 4DX tested heart-worm negative (if positive, they are treated), tested negative for tick borne diseases, spayed/neutered, implanted with a micro-chip and have been examined by a veterinarian to certify that they are healthy. Any other known health issues are treated as well prior to adoption (examples: UTI, broken bones, contagious infections, dental cleanings, etc). All animals are also on a regime of flea and heartworm medication every month. Lifetime registration for the micro-chip is included in each adoption fee. In addition, each adopter will go home with a fitted collar, tags, a bag of dog food the pet has been on, copies of all vet history, and an adoption kit filled with valuable information and coupons as well as other various treats or toys as promotions become available. All puppy adoptions include two puppy training books, the Puppy Primer & Way To Go by Patricia McConnell, and all adult adoptions go home with Love Has No Age Limit by Patricia McConnell to help ensure a smooth transition for your new family member.\n\nWe ask that you consider an additional donation on top of this pet's adoption fee. This money will go directly into our Adoption Fund to be used exclusively for rescuing and caring for other pets in need. Many pets we take in have very high vet bills to get them healthy and adoptable for the public - much higher than their adoption fees. We receive no government funding and rely solely on donations from our community and caring adopters to continue our rescue efforts!",

            "description": "Roscoe was transferred to THS from another shelter, and is now looking for a new home! Roscoe is an active and happy guy that has that glass-half-full personality! Everyone is a friend to this social guy, and he loves to snuggle! He is also social and playful with other dogs that he has met on-leash at the shelter. He also enjoys car rides! Roscoe can sometimes be a little nervous in new places initially, but quickly settles in once he's comfortable. Roscoe can be excitable initially, and would benefit from some basic obedience including loose-leash walking and to help boost his confidence. \n\nRoscoe was recently treated for heartworm, and will need restricted activity (no running, jumping, rough play) for 8 weeks following his treatment. It will also be important that he remain on monthly heartworm preventative - his new family will be asked to purchase a 1 year supply of heartworm preventative (at a discount) at the time of the adoption, in addition to his adoption fee. \n\nPlease follow this link to learn more about our current adoption process: https://toledohumane.org/covid-19-update",

Get your application in now!\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

He\u2019s a funny guy too because he likes to do goofy things like run around the backyard with a toy that is as big as he is.\n\nChamp got his name because he was very sick when we came to the rescue.  Actually, we were all quite emaciated and our little bellies were full of worms.  Champ had it worse than the rest of us.  He didn\u2019t want to eat or drink.  Our foster mom made him.  She would hold him and tell him that he needed to fight like a champ to get better.  And, boy, did he!  He is bigger than most of us now. \n\n\n\"C\" Puppies bio: \n\nHi everyone! \nWe are the \u201cC\u201d puppies because all of our names begin with the letter \u201cC\u201d.  Our names are Carol, Clara, Charlie, Chester, and Champ.  We are about 12 to 14 weeks old.  Sorry, but we don\u2019t remember exactly when we were born nor do we remember what breeds our mom and dad are.  Our foster mom says that we are beautiful puppies.  Is beautiful a breed?  We may look a lot alike, but our personalities are very different.  \nOnto the boring stuff. We have all been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped.  However, we will need another set of puppy vaccinations when we\u2019re a tad bit older.  The vet said that we are ready to find our forever homes!  We all currently weigh between 13 and 16 pounds.\nSo, if you are looking for a friendly, sweet puppy and you think one of us would make a good addition to your family please let the people at Toledo\u2019s Pet Bull Project know by going to www.toledospetbullproject.com and filling out an application.  There is no cost and no obligation to fill out an application.  However, there is a small adoption fee of $225 to help cover the cost of our vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter, etc.  There is also an additional $50 training fee that is refundable when you take us to a puppy training class.\n\nWe hope to meet you soon!\n\n",

Get your application in now!\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

            "description": "Lola Is a sweet lovable 7 year old dog who follows you in a non-annoying way, she likes to be in the same room with her people.  She is great with kids, and lives for walks.   She is good on the leash, but in new places she can pull and she is pretty strong.  She is not good with cats.  She is good with other dogs, as long as the other dogs are not aggressive with her.   She has met 7-8 other dogs, and never once initiated any aggression.   \n\nLola is a quiet dog unless you are the pool boy.  She doesn\u2019t really shed, and she sometimes sneaks up onto the couch when you\u2019re not looking.  Overall, a great girl and will make a great family member!  \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to LRRoF.org NOW and fill out an application.\n\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nYour support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today!\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family. All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.",

Even if you've raised puppies in the past, this is an invaluable resource to help make your new addition successful!\n\nMaize came into our care very pregnant. She gave birth to 11 puppies, who have all found homes. Maize was a wonderful Mom. It is her turn to find her furever home.\n\nMaize's foster mom has this to say about her. Maize is very good at sitting and posing for pictures! She will also lay down, and go to her bed for a treat. Maize is still working on her signal to go outside, but when taken outside she knows what to do. Maize does great in a gated area if needed. She isn't crazy about staying in a crate. Maize is very affectionate, and will be a great cuddle buddy for anyone who needs someone to watch Netflix with. Her favorite games are fetch and tug of war. She is very good with new people if introduced slowly. Treats are always helpful. Maize is unsure of new dogs and would probably do better as an only gal. However, with proper introductions I believe Maize could make some new canine friends over time. Maize is currently being treated for heartworms. The Humane Society will continue to provide this treatment in an adoptive home. Contact maryjames@hswctn.org for more information.",

If the ad is still viewable, we are still accepting applications. Please apply as the first step of the adoption process at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. \n\nMeet Bo! This 1 1/2 year old, 72 pound Doberman is looking for a new home. Bo would thrive in a home with a fenced yard and owners who can keep him active and continue to work on training with this big, goofy teenager. Bo is very friendly with strangers. He has not had much experience on leash and is quite strong. We will not be placing Bo in any apartment settings or homes without a physically fenced yard. Bo is house trained and crate trained. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped.\n\nBo has lived with children in the past and has done well. He doesn't seem to care for other dogs as he is getting older. He has had experience with cats and chases them.\n\nHis adoption fee is $200. If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. One application works for all of our dogs.",

She was pretty malnourished, a little skittish and in heat when we found her. After posting on several lost and found pet pages, no owner came forward. \n\nDixie was pretty cut up around the face and neck when we picked her up. Our vet confirmed her wounds were probably due to a dog fight. He also aged her at 1-1.5 yrs of age and said she may have had a litter of pups already. Our guess is she is part American Bulldog and Pit mix.\n\nDixie is super playful and loves attention. This girl is all muscle. She weighed in at 72 lbs when we took her for a well checkup and spay. Her ribs were still showing. She has since filled out and looks amazing. She seems to love guys!\n\nDixie has become quite loyal in just the couple months we have had her. We have learned that she prefers to be center of attention and prefers not to share that love, however, she is warming up to our dogs with supervision. We walk her multiple times daily on a leash and she is perfectly fine with our pack walking along with us and she has started playing with them through the fence.\n\nDixie loves her pool when we get back from walks and is extremely smart. She seems to always be smiling and just wants to please. She has learned to sit and lay down on command. She is doing pretty good with the \u201cstay\u201d command until we release her. It\u2019s a work in progress along with the no jumping part. Jumping comes from excitement. She thinks she weighs 5 lbs but reality is, she is closer to 90 now.\n\nDixie is a beautiful dog with her brindle markings and muscular physique. I really believe she would make someone an amazing dog and I think she would be fine with OLDER kids. I would not recommend young children or elderly because she is so big and powerful. A high energy family or single person would be great! Maybe a one dog household would work best so she doesn\u2019t feel she needs to compete for that love. With time and training, she may learn to be part of a pack.\n\nAll in all, Dixie is a beautiful, healthy, happy girl. I know there is a forever home out there somewhere for her! See Less",

He\u2019s smaller than most of us but he doesn\u2019t know it.\n\n\"C\" Puppies bio: \n\nHi everyone! \nWe are the \u201cC\u201d puppies because all of our names begin with the letter \u201cC\u201d.  Our names are Carol, Clara, Charlie, Chester, and Champ.  We are about 12 to 14 weeks old.  Sorry, but we don\u2019t remember exactly when we were born nor do we remember what breeds our mom and dad are.  Our foster mom says that we are beautiful puppies.  Is beautiful a breed?  We may look a lot alike, but our personalities are very different.  \nOnto the boring stuff. We have all been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped.  However, we will need another set of puppy vaccinations when we\u2019re a tad bit older.  The vet said that we are ready to find our forever homes!  We all currently weigh between 13 and 16 pounds.\nSo, if you are looking for a friendly, sweet puppy and you think one of us would make a good addition to your family please let the people at Toledo\u2019s Pet Bull Project know by going to www.toledospetbullproject.com and filling out an application.  There is no cost and no obligation to fill out an application.  However, there is a small adoption fee of $225 to help cover the cost of our vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter, etc.  There is also an additional $50 training fee that is refundable when you take us to a puppy training class.\n\nWe hope to meet you soon!\n\n",

Butters is a sweet, young guy who spent some time in PACC's decompression program for shy pups and is now feeling much more confident. Butters came to PACC by way of a friendly animal protection officer. While the weather is starting to become quite nice, Butters decided he'd had enough of the outdoor life and decided to hitch a ride to PACC so we can help set him up with a family of his own. Butters is a social pup who has been charming staffers and volunteers alike since he arrived at PACC shortly before Christmas. In play group, Butters was so excited to meet the other dogs he started greeting them through the fence. By the time he got into the yard, he was all waggy tail and tried to engage in a little bit of play (he doesn't really know how, and would love an owner that can show him the ropes.) Butters is a sweet dog who would do best with a confident owner or owners who can help him feel comfortable in his new home. If Butters sounds like your type of pup, make an appointment to meet him today.",

Rocky lived with the same family for his whole life and then found himself in a new home through no fault of his own. Things didn't work out there for Rocky so sadly he ended up at Hotel del PACC and he's hoping for a short stay. His previous family said that Rocky lived inside and was housebroken. He did well with a dog companion his size and with children ages 7-10. In his dog eval it took him a little time to warm up but he did eventually greet the other dogs and engage in play. He even tried to play with the humans. Volunteers say that Rocky loves him some treats, is enthusiastic about getting out for his walks and he enjoys being pet and loved on. He's the perfect age to bring into a new home - a courteous gentleman, no puppy shenanigans and he cleans up after himself and won't drink the last cup of coffee without making a new pot. If you are looking for a guy who will make you smile with his goofy grin Rocky just may be your guy.",

I can be a bit jumpy, so I would like to meet any children in the home prior to adoption. I have never been around dogs other than my brother, so it is recommended that I meet any other dogs in the home to see if we get along. I don't need to go to a home with my brother, but if you have room in your heart and home for both us, we would love to stay together!",

If interested, please apply at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting.  \n\nJack is a small, 20 pound, 10 year old, mixed breed boy looking for a new home. His hair is wire-y and he has some features like a Chihuahua but a docked little tail almost like a Pug. He loves everyone he meets. Jack enjoys visiting company and was always good when the caregivers would come into the home to take care of his previous owner before she sadly passed away. We will recommend children over 8 due to his inexperience with small children. Jack is said to be not good with other animals. We haven't had an opportunity to test him and plan to look for a foster or adoptive home with no other pets and a fenced yard since this is what he is used to. \n\nJack uses potty pads in the house and has not been going outside much due to the failing health of his owner. Jack recently spent time in a foster home and will need a securely fenced yard in his home. Jack was absolutely adored by his owner and we would love to find someone else for him to love him to pieces until the very end. He's a charming little guy with a lot of love to give. Jack is a quiet dog and doesn't bark much. \n\nJack is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm negative.  His adoption fee is $100. If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. One application works for all of our dogs. If interested in fostering, you provide the love and we provide any supplies you may need until we locate a forever home for Jack.",

She is a very sweet girl, and our foster mom thinks she\u2019s very pretty too.\n\n\n\"C\" Puppies bio: \n\nHi everyone! \nWe are the \u201cC\u201d puppies because all of our names begin with the letter \u201cC\u201d.  Our names are Carol, Clara, Charlie, Chester, and Champ.  We are about 12 to 14 weeks old.  Sorry, but we don\u2019t remember exactly when we were born nor do we remember what breeds our mom and dad are.  Our foster mom says that we are beautiful puppies.  Is beautiful a breed?  We may look a lot alike, but our personalities are very different.  \nOnto the boring stuff. We have all been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped.  However, we will need another set of puppy vaccinations when we\u2019re a tad bit older.  The vet said that we are ready to find our forever homes!  We all currently weigh between 13 and 16 pounds.\nSo, if you are looking for a friendly, sweet puppy and you think one of us would make a good addition to your family please let the people at Toledo\u2019s Pet Bull Project know by going to www.toledospetbullproject.com and filling out an application.  There is no cost and no obligation to fill out an application.  However, there is a small adoption fee of $225 to help cover the cost of our vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter, etc.  There is also an additional $50 training fee that is refundable when you take us to a puppy training class.\n\nWe hope to meet you soon!\n\n",

She is usually the first one of us to do something like play king of the mountain by climbing on top of an overturned milk crate.  Our foster mom said that she needs a dog savvy home because she is really smart and sometimes sneaky.  She\u2019s a lot of fun!\n\n\"C\" Puppies bio: \n\nHi everyone! \nWe are the \u201cC\u201d puppies because all of our names begin with the letter \u201cC\u201d.  Our names are Carol, Clara, Charlie, Chester, and Champ.  We are about 12 to 14 weeks old.  Sorry, but we don\u2019t remember exactly when we were born nor do we remember what breeds our mom and dad are.  Our foster mom says that we are beautiful puppies.  Is beautiful a breed?  We may look a lot alike, but our personalities are very different.  \nOnto the boring stuff. We have all been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped.  However, we will need another set of puppy vaccinations when we\u2019re a tad bit older.  The vet said that we are ready to find our forever homes!  We all currently weigh between 13 and 16 pounds.\nSo, if you are looking for a friendly, sweet puppy and you think one of us would make a good addition to your family please let the people at Toledo\u2019s Pet Bull Project know by going to www.toledospetbullproject.com and filling out an application.  There is no cost and no obligation to fill out an application.  However, there is a small adoption fee of $225 to help cover the cost of our vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter, etc.  There is also an additional $50 training fee that is refundable when you take us to a puppy training class.\n\nWe hope to meet you soon!\n\n",

Hawk is is good with other dogs, loves people and kids. When he is not being a socialite he runs for fun and exercise.

WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/30) \n\nMY STORY: Jasper is the best boy. He did break his front foot at some time and also lost the outside toe and part of the foot. With that said, our vet said he is not in pain and is using it so does not need attention. There will not be wear that will cause sores, which is something we worry about in these instances. He does walk with a limp. The break may have been at the ankle, so from the ankle down is what he uses as a foot. He runs and plays and wonders why everyone is so concerned about his foot. Let's go!\n\nDogs are held for two weeks after arrival date. You are welcome to apply, but applications will be processed closer to the available date.\n\nDogs needing foster homes are available for adoption This dog does need a foster home.

Odin is in a kennel where he can go outside whenever he wants and does well using the bathroom outside so he would do well with a doggy door with very little training on how to use it. If a doggy door isnt possible he will need some training on when to let you know he needs to go potty.

He's an energetic boy who would do well with an active family ready to keep him busy. Chase would benefit from training time and comfortably learning more about the world around him. He would probably do well with an energetic canine playmate. We think Chase will excel in a home with adults and children 12+ ready to shape him into the excellent adult dog he can become.\nxxx\n\nPlease note: \nWe are currently adopting out of state for our longer stay animals only.  This pet is only available for in state adoption.  We give preference to Fairfield county residents.  We do not guarantee that all filed applications will be processed, but we will contact you.  \nWe are not currently adopting to Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine or Rhode Island due to burdensome regulations involved with importing an animal.\n\nInterested in adopting?

There will be a drop down menu where you must read and meet all of the prerequisites. Next, read the \"Steps To Adoption\", fill out the \"Interest Form\" and submit it online. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO APPLY. Unfortunately, we are unable to respond to inquires made in any other way.\n\nPoodle Rescue will contact you if we feel this dog, or a similar dog in our program, matches the specifications on your Questionnaire/Interest Form. Please keep in mind Poodles and Poodle Mixes are in high demand therefore the demand for them far outweigh the supply. If you do not hear from us please re-submit your Interest form quarterly as they are not recurring. Unfortunately, we cannot answer email or telephone inquiries about our available dogs.  Please be sure you have a current phone number listed on the questionnaire/Interest Form and the best time we can reach you. Adoption Fees vary.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, current on shots, parasite / heart worm disease tested (and treated if positive).

He is a 3-year-old male retriever mix who really loves to go for walks outdoors and play ball. He would make a wonderful pet for someone who is active. Baxter would love to go to the park or maybe become your running partner. \n\nHe does not like other animals, so he does NEED to be the only pet in the home.  He also needs some training as he will try and be the boss. For that reason, we are asking that he go to an adult-only, experienced adopter.\n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nFor our shelter updates, check out Friends of the Edison Animal Shelter Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/edisonanimalshelter\n\nTo view all of the Edison Animal Shelter's available pets on Petfinder (which includes pictures and bios), please click on the following link: https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=NJ593\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/edisonshelter/?igshid=1b8ab04w24mb6",

After several weeks of a good place to live, care, and mostly lots of attention and LOVE, Ford has become a real dog who now comes bouncing out of his kennel and running up to everyone looking for the beloved treat.  But big trucks and school busses still scare him.   Ford is an Australian Shepherd mix with an estimated DOB of 9/2017.  Aussies are known to be anti-social with other dogs unless they are socialized young, and Ford was not, so he'll need to be an only dog.  And being a herding dog, he would probably do better in a home with no small children.  Anyone who first meets FORD may think that he, like many Aussies, is a little standoffish, but for us, having seen how far he has come so quickly,  and knowing how very very smart he is, we know that he isn't standoffish for long, he loves attention from people and he loves being part of human activities.  Ford keeps his kennel so clean that he is always the easiest to clean up after.  This is a dog that just needs a chance at a happy life. \n\nIf you are interested in Ford, please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

Talia was rescued from a local shelter with demodex mange.  She has recovered and is furry, happy and healthy now.  \n\nTalia is perfect according to her foster mom.  She is so smart!  She sits on command, knows stay, and has done excellent with her crate/house training.  Talia rides well in a car, loves to play, and loves to cuddle up with her people.  She also enjoys a super comfy bed to sleep in.  Talia is great with kids!\n\nTalia would like a home where she has a fenced in yard and an active family.  She would make a great companion for a family with kids old enough to play with her, cuddle her, and give her lots of exercise.  \n\nTalia is doing excellent with her potty training (she rings a bell now), kennel trained, and walks well on a leash. \n\nTalia is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Talia and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Roman is a healthy neutered male looking for his forever home after being abandoned by his owner at a vet clinic. He has been there the past 2 years, and is desperately in need of a home where he can decompress and enjoy the rest of his life.\n\nRoman can be REACTIVE with new people and dogs, but has formerly lived with dog friends. Once he knows a new dog, he is more comfortable and will show his playful and relaxed side. Once Roman gets to trust you, he will roll over for belly rubs and loves toys! \n\nTo adopt Roman, please contact holland@catcastlenyc.org. Since he does not get along with all people, we will need you (and any pets) to come meet him before moving forward with the adoption process. He is up to date on vaccines, negative for heart worm, neutered, and has no special needs.",

We were told dad was a american bully but we can't garantee that. THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO TAKE HOME ON JANUARY 25TH. Get your application in now!\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

            "description": "\nPLEASE, PLEASE READ  carefully.  Most of your questions will be answered in this biography.\n\nSweet HOOK will be placed in his pre-approved adoptive home around the end of February after his neuter.  \n\nHOOK was born to  Mom Sandy (see photo)  in the safety of a wonderful foster home.  We are so glad that he and his ten (yes, ten!) littermates made it to safety in time for the blessed event.  \n\nHOOK  is a baby (born December 28, 2020)  and wants a home that understands the world of puppies. He will only be placed in a loving home that is dedicated to work on house training, leash manners, and will introduce him to a variety of safe activities and experiences so he can be comfortable in the world. \n\nWhile we never had the pleasure of meeting Baby Daddy, Mom, Sandy, is a gorgeous Retriever Mix that weighs about 40 lbs. However, HOOK may grow to be smaller, the same size, or larger, at adulthood and with a similar or different \"look.\"\n\nPuppies are immunized on a strict vet recommended schedule, and HOOK's forever family will be required, at their own expense, to complete the puppy immunization schedule, including rabies, if placed in your home prior to the schedule being completed.  Adopters are provided with current vetting records to provide to their personal vet, and we will confirm that you DO complete that vetting schedule in a timely manner, including the purchase of monthly preventatives (flea & heart worm).   HOOK will be neutered & microchipped  before being placed in his forever home.\n\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit our website at www.youluckydogrescue.org and read our Adoption FAQ's and Before You Adopt documents. You can complete an online adoption application from our website. You can also email info@youluckydogrescue.org for additional details that are not included in this biography.\n\nPRIVATE MEET & GREETS: Submitting an adoption application is required before a private meet & greet will be scheduled. We will complete a pre-screening first to make sure that the dog you are interested in is a good fit for you. That way, we don't unnecessarily waste your time or the foster's time. \n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age-appropriate vaccines, spay or neuter and microchipping. All of our rescue dogs are heart worm tested annually beginning at 9 months of age, and they are kept on monthly heart worm and flea preventatives.\n\nThe breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog. We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue. \n\nWe are located in the metro Atlanta area. We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.\n\nwww.youluckydogrescue.org - Adoption Application can be found at this website.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: SIMBA\n*Age: 1.5 years\n*Current Weight: 90#\n*Rescued from: Rural Texas, owner surrendered for \"Too big & energetic\" \n*Adoption fee: $375 \n*Health: Up to date vaccinations, heartworm negative, neutered\n\nSimba is a gorgeous, big, goofy & energetic Great Dane mixed with a Mastiff. Simba is a big boy & he will need a family who has experience with his breed. He loves to play & is dog friendly. He does need a playmate who understands his size & energy. Simba is smart & loves to please his person. He knows some basic commands, is crate trained & does great in the car. Simba has always lived in a home & was house trained. He is good with all people BUT he is big & has no clue of his size. Simba will need a home with older children only because he is big & bouncy. Simba loves to cuddle & hug, we are working with him on not hugging unless asked to. He is a staff favorite & loved by all who meet him. Simba needs a fenced yard & would love to have a playmate but that is not a requirement. \n \nSimba was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. He will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on 1/23/2020 ready for adoption! To apply to adopt Simba, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

I am OK with that as long as you train me. I am very smart, but no one has taken the time to train me. I can focus better after some exercise. I need a lot of exercise because I have a bunch of energy. I know exercise is good for humans too, so maybe we can make each other better and live our best lives together. I would love a big yard, because chasing the ball is one of my great joys. This little kennel is no place for a high energy boy like me. But if you leave me alone in the house, I think a kennel is good idea, if you promise not to leave me there too much. If you think you have a good home for me, I will love you forever.",

His other favorite hobby is hanging out with his family. This gentle giant was house trained in his previous home. He is also accustomed to using a crate. Coolio lived with an older family and has never met young kids.\n\nCoolio has lived with multiple dogs in his previous home. He is picky about what dogs he likes, and would do best with a a polite dog who will not try to steal his beloved ball. He has never lived with cats.\n\nUpon admission, the vets at Lollypop Farm identified masses on Coolio's body, some of which are not safe to surgically remove. After sending a sample for biopsy, they determined that they are mostly mast cell tumors. Mast cell tumors can metastasize to internal organs, so Coolio's new owner will work with their vet to keep a close eye on his condition and determine what treatment or interventions are needed. Chemotherapy or radiation may be options for Coolio, but are outside the scope of what we can provide at the shelter.\n\nIf Coolio sounds like the right dog for you, click the orange \"Schedule An Appointment\" box above to make an appointment to meet with an Adoption Counselor.",

She is very fit, agile, athletic and energetic, not to mention very smart. Highly trainable with enough food and toy drive to potentially make a great dog sport or performance partner.\n\nShe currently displays some unruly teen behavior, typical of a poorly socialized adolescent Malinois, and will need a human partner to help her mature into a proper lady. Our handling team has been working with her on some behavior management and certain canine citizenship skills and will expect any adopter to be willing to maintain and build on her progress so far. \n\nBeckham came to us from a shelter in Elk Grove, CA where she was picked up as a stray after a family saw her wandering and get hit by a car, when an officer arrived at the scene, Beckham was carrying on with her wander without a care, showing no signs of injury after all. \n\nShe has all the qualities we look for in search dogs--love for toys, love for food, love for the hunt, love for action--but just not quite enough for her to be a working dog.\n\nShe will be most successful with those who have prior breed experience as Mals can be Mals. She can be reactive to other dogs while on leash, go over threshold quickly if stimulated, wants and needs to do things. No cats, please. No small children. A secure yard or living space, as she is an escape artist.\n\nThe AKC describes the Belgian Malinois like this: to deny a Mal activity and the pleasure of your company is to deprive them of their very reasons for being. Beckham would agree with this. Are you game enough to offer her the pleasure of your company?\n\nBeckham is 10 months old and weighs 45 lbs. She is up to date on vaccinations and will be spayed before release.",

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Jance. I'm about 5 years old and I weigh about 57 lbs. \nI was picked up by the pound after being chained to a telephone pole on a backroad one night. \nI was very afraid at first and I didn't really want to let people get too close to me, but after being here at the pound for a while, I have learned that it is okay to trust people and I've been doing great. \nI LOVE LOVE LOVE playing fetch. I'm pretty smart and pick up on things pretty quickly. \nI am very clean in my kennel at night and I appear to be housebroken. \nIf you're looking for a sweet dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

Our owner was taken to the hospital and unable to care for us. \n\nSince August, I have never been adopted or fostered. I am an active boy and I can be a bit stubborn, but that is all just part of my charm! I get along with certain dogs (so I would HAVE to meet your other dogs first), I have never met a stuffed animal I did not like, and I am kennel trained. I would make an excellent jogging buddy and I would keep your home safe. \n\nPlease come check me out soon! Love, Adam",

Duke came to Dirt Road Doggies Rescue recently after a concerned samaritan saw him, his brother Bandit Boo (already adopted) and their feral mom on the side of a rural road. Duke has made major progress with his social skills in his foster home and loves to spend his day running and playing with the other dogs in his foster home. Duke is crate trained, potty trained and gets along well with other dogs. Because of his past Duke can be a bit shy, needing a few minutes to warm up to new people. Because of his shyness he would be most happy with another dog in the home to show him the way. Small children would not be a good fit for Duke because they scare him. But he would love a child 10 years or older to play with. Duke's new family would need to be patient with him as he settles into his new enviroment.",

He loves to give hugs. He has an amazing nature and loving heart. He lives with four small children and adores each of them. Jax LOVES to snuggle! He would love to be someones loyal companion who will be home with him often. He loves to play fetch and will entertain himself with his toys or multiple balls for a long time. He would do best in a home with another playful dog and/or someone who just wants to love on him a good part of the day. He enjoys watching out the window during the day. He needs leash training due to his high interest in squirrels and rabbits.... or you could just let him enjoy the backyard or a playmate for exercise. He does all potty business in the backyard. He is continuing his training successfully with sit, down and stay as well as respecting personal space. He does not have any separation anxiety but would be much happier with a companion who givek him lots of attention and love!",

All resident animals must be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative (if applicable).\n\tMust receive proof of pet deposit and lease allowing pets if renting.\n\tWillingness and capacity to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment and responsible care for a pet.\n\tApplicant is home more than not.\n\tAny poisonous plants must be removed from the yard before the home visit.\n\tHome visit is required.

            "description": "Meet our little low-riser cutie, Alfie.  He is about 9 months old and weighs 25 lbs.  We believe he is a Corgi/ Pittie/ Chi mix\n\nAlfie was surrendered to a rural shelter with his sister, Tessa. The owner was moving & could no longer keep the siblings. Alfie is very friendly, loves to play & is happy go-lucky. He is smart & enjoy learning new things. Alfie is working on his house training skills and has little accidents, he is crate trained, does well on a leash but working on getting better & does well in a car.  He would do best in a home with older children (over the age of 7-8) because he can play and get a little rowdy.   He is used to living in a home & loves to curl up on the couch & cuddle with his human. \n\n\n*Adoption fee: $495 \n\n*Health: Up to date vaccinations, heartworm negative, neutered\n\nTo apply to adopt this puppy, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records. Remember, most of the time rescues are all just taking our best guess with breeds!\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

She is extremely energetic and high energy and loves to run run run so a home with a yard and a owner who loves adventures would be fantastic. She doesnt rush or bolt out of her kennel like in the past but every now and then she will test you and try it. She just gets so excited and wants to be on the go. She jumps up on people because she loves you so much and wants all the pets so little kids will be problematic for her. Shes still learning her manners but has a wonderful sweet personality and wants to please. She just needs an assertive but compassionate owner because she wants to be boss but at the same time has sensitive feelings.",

            "description": "Nova Lee is a very lively and energetic Boxer Terrier, born April, 2016. She would love to go to an active home with lots of affection. She is friendly with all people - even strangers - but does not enjoy the company of other dogs. She will tolerate cats if properly introduced. Nova Lee loves toys but will need some training as she does resource guard her toys as well as bolt out the door. This sweet girl is move-in ready; she is kennel trained, house trained, and knows some commands. She needs to be crated when home alone as she can become destructive when bored. Nova Lees perfect home would be an active one with people who love to give and receive plenty of loveoh, and lots and lots of toys! She needs a fenced in yard - preferably a tall fence. No kids under 12 years old due to resource guarding.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Nova Lee is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Buddy was picked up as a stray and brought to a shelter in Baton Rouge, LA in March, during the height of COVID-19 when the shelter was short-staffed.   It saddens us to think that this sweet boy had spent so many months of his life in a shelter, but all of that is in his past! \n\nBuddy, came north in mid-September and was placed in what we hoped would be his forever home in NJ.  However, the environment of a townhouse community where they live had too much activity, and Buddy got too excited with so many dogs around.  He would be best suited in a quieter area in a home with a solidly fenced-in yard. \n\nBuddy is great with other dogs when he meets and plays with them, but he would do best as an only pet in the home.  When on leash, he gets excited when he sees another dog from a distance and will jump and bark, so he is currently working on his leash reactivity with a trainer.  Buddy is making great progress and looks forward to meeting his forever family. Buddy\u2019s adopter will need to understand that the behavior is a work in progress and continue his training with a professional trainer.  His adopter will need to be fully committed to bringing Buddy along to be a happy and balanced dog.  If his adopter is in Norwalk, CT area, the adopter will have a chance to work with Buddy\u2019s trainer.\n\nBuddy learns commands and tricks quickly, has great manners around the house, and would learn your routine quickly. He sits as soon as he sees someone coming with a treat and takes it gently from their hand.  Buddy adores people, young and old, and at the sight of a person, Buddy wiggles so hard he can barely walk!  He loves lots of attention and likes to be right next to you or even in your lap.  He falls right to sleep at night or when you leave the house.  Buddy is housebroken and you\u2019ll know when he needs to go out for a potty break because he\u2019ll walk up to you, sit at your feet, and stretch his paw out!  He loves playing fetch and is a very energetic boy.  Like all young dogs, he will need an active adopter to give him the exercise he needs.  Buddy is a wonderful companion on a long hike.  However, he is just as happy cuddling up with you on the couch for hours - he\u2019ll do anything for a good ear rub!  He is very expressive with his personality.\n\nBuddy is believed to be a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever mix.  This little fellow is as cute as can be and is estimated to be about 1.5 years old.  He weighs only 32 lbs and is completely full-grown. Buddy\u2019s size is perfect for just about anyone, especially those of us who are finding they want a smaller dog as we get older and cannot pick up a 90 lb dog.  He is a furry little bundle of total joy!\n\nBuddy has been brought up-to-date on vaccinations, is neutered, micro-chipped, and he is heartworm negative. For the first year of adoption, he must be given the brand name Heartguard for his heartworm preventative. After that, a generic may be considered.  Like many dogs, Buddy has some seasonal allergies that gave him an itchy paw in the Fall.  His food allergies are controlled with his diet.\n\nRescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.  \n\nIf you would like to be part of Buddy's rescue story, and you have already been approved for adoption through SGRR, please contact Michelle Hamed at: SunshineMichelleH@gmail.com     to be considered to adopt Buddy.           \n\nIf not yet approved for adoption, please visit our website to learn more and to submit an online application:     http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com/adoption-info1.html  \n\nPlease DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com   \n\nThank you!\n \nABOUT OUR RESCUE\nBefore being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. \n\nThe information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.\n\nSGRR ADOPTION FEES - Effective May 1, 2020  (subject to change)\n  \n  $750    Puppy - up to 6 months              \n  $650    Young 6 months - 6 years            \n  $550    Senior 7 - 9  years                       \n  $450    Senior 10 years and older          \n \n  $550    Young Special Needs                \n  $400    Senior 7+ Special Needs                \n\n$1000    Young Bonded Pair                   \n  $900    Senior 7+ Bonded Pair         \n\nA contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their SGRR dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. \n\nMost of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  \n\nPlease be a ray of light for this Sunshine dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a Sunshine dog.\n\nPlease visit our website at: http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com  to learn more about our rescue and to make a Donation to support Sunshine Golden Retriever Rescue.  \n\nTHANK YOU!",

Tank was very nervous and confused at first.  He didn't understand what had happened to him.  Now that he is more relaxed, his true lovable personality shows.  He is a 6 year old neutered male that is current on all vaccinations. This Shepherd/Boxer mix has a short black coat with some tan and white markings and weighs in at 66 pounds.  He loves attention from people!  When excited, he does pull on the leash.  Overall though, his manners are good.  Tank does love treats and lots of petting!  We don't think he has ever lived with another dog or cat.  We hope he finds his new home soon!!",

            "description": "Rain is a 10-month-old female Catahoula Leopard Dog mix who must be spayed before she is adopted. She came to PAHS after she was turned in as a stray; and since no one came in to reclaim her--she is available for adoption. Rain is an unusual looking but gorgeous girl! Her coat is mostly brown to light tan with beautiful black merle markings. Rain weighs 37 pounds so she is considered to be a medium sized young adult dog. She is leash trained and house trained. One thing you should be aware of is that Rain can climb a six foot chain link fence like a monkey. She would definitely need a wooden fenced yard. This incredible little athlete is friendly, affectionate, and would be good with children. Rain would also not mind sharing her wooden fenced yard and home with another dog. Well, the Olympics are coming up but we hope Rain gets a home before she qualifies for fencing--that is climbing fences!Dog/puppy adoption fees are $120 and cat/kitten adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative.",

Sounds complicated right? I am being told this can cause issues or just be cosmetic. In my case it seems to be cosmetic.\n\nI am looking for someone to love me for who I am.

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: ASPEN\n*Age: appx 1.5 years\n*Current Weight: 60#\n*Rescued from: Rural Texas where she was found as a stray.\n*Adoption fee: $375 \n*Health: Up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, spayed\n\nAspen is a gorgeous Labrador X Husky looking for a family to love & play with. She is a happy go-lucky girl always ready to play. She can be bouncy when she is excited but we are working on better manners. Aspen loves other dogs but has not met any cats yet. She is crate trained, working on leash training & rides well in the car. Aspen has never met a stranger. She needs continued work on basic training & is VERY smart. This goofy gal is ready to join a fun loving family. She needs a fenced back yard & would love a playmate but that is not a requirement for adoption. \n\nAspen was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. She will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on 1/23/2020 ready for adoption! To apply to adopt Aspen, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

She is an eight-year-old, Siberian Husky mix, looking for a forever foster home.\nMaddie was rescued by our Humane Officer, after spending her entire life outside on a chain. Our Humane Officer discovered she was lethargic, underweight, and had a severe mammary tumor on her underside.  She knew she had to get her medical help right away. She was brought to the WAHS where our medical team jumped into action to do all they could for Maddie. She was treated for an infection and once her blood levels were stabilized, she received surgery to remove the mass. The surgery was successful, and Maddie is bouncing back! Unfortunately, after a biopsy, it was determined that her cancer will continue to spread. \nWe are looking for a hospice foster, where she can spend the rest of her days in the comfort of a home. Her medical care and any other necessities will be supplied by the WAHS. All we want is for this sweet girl to receive the love and comfort she truly deserves while she still can. She is a staff favorite and frequently spends time visiting different offices and taking naps.  She is a curious girl who loves to be by your side, and still enjoys a short, daily walk.  \n? Maddie\u2019s preferred foster home would be a quiet one. After a careful assessment by our trainer, it was determined she cannot be in a home with any other pets. Due to her medical condition and the current healing process, she requires a foster home with older/adult children. If you are interested in opening your home to Maddie\u2019s big heart and beautiful blue and brown eyes, please contact our Foster Coordinator at 724-470-9708 or Foster@washingtonpashelter.org.",

She loves to be close to people, and although she is cautious and barks at new people when she first meets them, she's not a big barker. She is quick to alert her family at the first sign of danger though. She loves to play with toys and go for walks. She is good with other dogs and with cats, although she does not require another pet in the home to be happy. She has gotten a little \"growly\" with younger kids in the past, so if there are any kids in the home, we are requiring them to be older than 10 and respectful. Missy is currently 45 lbs and on a weight loss plan. Her ideal adopter would be committed to helping her get to her ideal weight. We are requiring a secure fenced-in yard for Missy.\n\nIf you live in the central Florida (Orlando) area and think you have the perfect forever home for Missy, we'd love to find out more about you. Please fill in our adoption application and we'll see if you're Missy's perfect match.",

If you have additional questions about this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or contact us through our website!\n\nGardner is a 3-year-old, 64 lb pointer mix who arrived at the shelter on 1/13/21.  Gardner is an energetic guy but once you start petting him, he will sit calmly and lean in for more.  Gardner is super affectionate and loves nothing more than receiving pets and belly rubs.  Gardner gets along great with other dogs but is a little unsure about cats. \n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400. The price includes: a Home Again Microchip, set of shots, de-worming, heartworm testing (if old enough), spay or neuter, and a 1 year rabies shot (if old enough). All dogs adopted must leave with a county license at an additional cost of $17, this fee is cash only. Adoption fees can be done using credit card or cash.  If you are interested in this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or fill out an online application at www.hsmcohio.org\n",

Both pups have front leg issues but are otherwise very healthy.\n\nEmi is a super cute little girl who loves to roll around on the grass.  She\u2019s not much of a hiker but she\u2019ll love to go picnics or short little walks at the park or beach.\n\nHer condition is not operable but we have just received some special harnesses that might help her walk better.  And a cart is in her near future. Once she gets that who knows how far she will be able to go!\n\nShe is full size at 26 pounds.\n\nShe\u2019s not perfect. Who is? But she\u2019s happy and silly and she loves people and other dogs. We\u2019d love for her to be adopted with her brother.\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://dawgsquad.org/adoption-application/",

Both pups have front leg issues but are otherwise very healthy.\n\nDashi is an absolute goofball who loves to roll around on the grass.   He\u2019s also a lot faster than you think he would be \u2013 he can really get going on those stubby front legs.\n\nHis condition is not operable but we have just received some special harnesses that might help on his walks.   And, a cart is in his near future.   Once he gets that who knows how fast he will be able to go!\n\nHe is full size at 28 pounds.\n\nHe\u2019s not perfect.   Who is?   But he\u2019s happy and silly and he loves people and other dogs.   We\u2019d love for him to be adopted with his sister.\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://dawgsquad.org/adoption-application/\n",

If you have additional questions about this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or contact us through our website!\n\nHi! My name is Spot and I'm in search for my forever home! \nI'm a terrier mix, around 2 years old, weighing about 50 pounds! My people tell me I'm an amazing boy and I think so too. I'm looking for a new home because my first owner passed away from a heart attack, although my story is a sad one, I'm ready for my happy ending. I did test positive for heartworms, but don't let that stop you from meeting me because the people of HSMC are getting me all fixed up and ready to find a home to call mine. While I go through all my treatments and medications, I REALLY want to go to a foster home, that will hopefully be my forever home when I'm done with my treatments! I'm as sweet as they come, and always ready to be out and about on a short walk, or just hanging out inside with my people, chewing on a toy or soaking up as much love as I can get. I like other dogs, but I can't play with them just yet, because it's important that I have to stay calm. In my old home, I didn't like the kitty, I thought it was just something I had to chase, so I need to go to a home without. As far as young kids, they make me a little nervous, but I like older kids that can play with me! I'm a very clean boy, I don't like to make messes in my kennel, I will always hold it until I can go outside. I'm such a good boy, always wanting to please and spread all my love to everyone! I'm constantly seeking for affection, as getting love is my favorite thing ever, and I like to return the love by giving cuddles and kisses! I'm a pretty smart boy too! I know how to sit, laydown and stay (treats are always a bonus)! I cannot wait to meet my forever family and share my endless amounts of love!\n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400. The price includes: a Home Again Microchip, set of shots, de-worming, heartworm testing (if old enough), spay or neuter, and a 1 year rabies shot (if old enough). All dogs adopted must leave with a county license at an additional cost of $17, this fee is cash only. Adoption fees can be done using credit card or cash.  If you are interested in this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or fill out an online application at www.hsmcohio.org\n",

He loves to cuddle and wants to be near you. He has gained some weight since the pictures were taken.  \nOver all, you you not ask for a better behaved dog. Sure he has some corks but they are easy to manage. If you are interested in meeting Odin, please email me at Siems@bellsouth.net.\nHis adoption fee is $270.",

We don't know why someone would want to dump us on the streets, but we know we will hit the jackpot soon with a family that will love us forever! We are very happy boys and love everyone we meet! We are dog friendly but prefer not to live with cats. We love to play outside and cuddle. We are low to medium energy. We can be playful when you want, but also cuddly when you want. We enjoy walks and riding in the car. We are super sweet and will love anyone immediately. We have been through a lot and we are just hoping to find someone that can be there for us forever! \n\nSaint is the all brown one and he is around 2 years old. Felix is the brindle one and he is around 1 year old. Their adoption fee is $750 for the pair.\n\nApply for them here: www.whenthegoinggetsruff.org/adopt",

This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. Puck is cat-friendly and is playful with cats. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

They are very friendly little ones, we think possibly chihuahua mixed with doxie and maybe some pug even?  They were very loved, a bit too much actually,  and they are dangerously overweight at 17lbs (Mia) and a whopping 21 lbs (Mio)!  They are starting on a diet and exercise program immediately and looking for a home equally committed to their weight loss so they can live a long healthy life.  They are fine with cats and other dogs and are happy well adjusted pups.  \n\nEmail njwoof@cs.com to meet this comical duo!\n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

He has quite the story, read about it below! \n\n\"Jack is a complete sweetheart who has been on a JOURNEY lately, literally and figuratively. Last year he was living with the family he\u2019d been with his whole life in a small town in Tennessee when he suddenly went blind. For some reason, his people surrendered him to a vet\u2019s office, where he lived in a kennel in a back building for several months. Thanks to a Facebook post, he was brought to Portland by a series of amazing volunteers driving (and even flying) him over 2000 miles across the country in hopes of finding a new home. Now that he\u2019s been here a couple months, lost some weight, and recovered from a bout of pneumonia he\u2019s ready to find his people! Jack is completely blind and also doesn\u2019t hear very well at all. He\u2019s been working on how to communicate with his foster dad, and a free session with an experienced special needs trainer is included with his adoption so he can keep progressing. Jack would enjoy a mellow home with some very patient adults who can continue working with him to further improve his confidence, physical strength, and navigation skills. He\u2019s good in a crate and great in the car and is VERY food motivated and responds well to positive training. Jack doesn\u2019t need a lot of exercise and likes to just relax in his bed somewhere near his person, and is fully housetrained and can go for quite some time between potty breaks. He hasn\u2019t done particularly well with small children in the past but he would probably be fine with well-mannered and supervised kids. He is good with other dogs -- he currently has four foster siblings -- but prefers them on the calmer side, and cats are an unknown (but he doesn\u2019t move very fast). Jack's new home should have minimal steps since they're a challenge for him to navigate, and ideally a fenced yard for him to freely explore. \"\n\nIf you are interested in Jack please fill out the application at the link below\n\nhttp://www.deafdogsoforegon.org/adoption-application.html",

            "description": "Sabrina is a happy go lucky spirited girl. She loves attention from anyone and everyone and is not shy at all! Sabrina has a lot of energy that she loves to get out on walks, playing tug, and rough housing. She doesn\u2019t have a prey drive towards cats, but she will chase them in a playful way (and doesn\u2019t take no for an answer!), so dog savvy cats would be best. She is cool with other dogs. Ideally, if Sabrina has a canine sibling, they would be a larger dog. Sabrina is so happy all around, but sometimes her happiness and energy come off as a lack of manners and boundaries. She is very smart, though, and her foster mom has been working on leash manners and food time manners to start. So far Sabrina has gone from refusing to go in her crate to going in on command, jumping and lunging for her food to sitting and waiting for permission to eat. While her manners still have a long way to go, her potential and desire to please her humans will make that very easy to address. Due to her size and energy, Sabrina is looking for a home with no human kiddos under the age of 12 years\n\nTo meet Sabrina, please visit our website, www.pittieslovepeace.com, to submit an adoption application. Sabrina is spayed, microchipped and vaccinated. \n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing a predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

I've lived all my life with 2 other female beagles outside as a hunting dog. I'm the mother of the other beagles on the Nittany Beagle Rescue website who lived outside as hunting dogs. I'm in a foster home now & I'm LOVING it! I loved the bath my foster mom gave me, & I adore having my head & back rubbed! I like to stick right by my foster family.    I'm making great progress on housetraining & house manners. I'm very smart! I'm learning fast about living in a home.  I'm still a little jumpy, & I might be that way for awhile. This is all really, really different for me. Because I haven't been around young children, I will be placed in a home with older children (8-12 years) or no children. I need a home where I will have a securely fenced yard. I have been known to dig under a fence, so it needs to be secure. I will run off looking for bunnies to chase if I get loose. I don't know how to walk on a leash, & so that is something I need to learn. Because I never went anywhere, I'm pretty timid in new situations. I'm a big girl - about 40 lbs.  I will be spayed before I'm adopted. I also have a mammary tumor that will be removed when I'm spayed. I'm anxious to become part of a family as a member of the household, enjoying life on the couch! Please think about making me part of your family!",

She does not do well around babies, toddlers or young children and will growl or nip. She does fine in a crate. She loves to snuggle in bed or in a lap. She will need some help potty training. She sometimes uses pee pads. She loves to cuddle under the blankets. She will also leap in your lap for affection and paw at you lovingly for attention. She loves adults, and will happily sit and snuggle as long as possible. Overall, Angel is very quiet and almost never barks. She will tolerate other small animals in the house. She has not been around larger dogs with her current foster.",

            "description": "Vinny was rescued from a shelter. He was neglected and emaciated. The shelter fed him extra food to help him gain some weight in the past 2 weeks. Vinny is a sweetie and charming to all people and dogs. With an over-excited large dog he just backed away. He is cooperative loves treats and is ready to learn. Vinny is a sweetie and is now relaxing at his hero foster home with 2 other dogs. More info. to come as he learns relaxes gets healthier and heals from his neuter surgery and shows more of his personality. Needs a home with an attached yard.\nUpdate from Foster Home 1/30/21: Vinny was a stray picked up in poor condition extremely underweight. The shelter and foster parents have helped him put on weight by feeding him lots of healthy and nutritious food. He now looks fantastic with a beautiful shiny coat.\nHe is a very sweet dog would like to be a lapdog and quite submissive he lives with a much smaller dog (who is a boss) and a cat he gets on really well with both of them. He is quite rambunctious at times so children need to be 12+ he is only young so has lots of energy. He will require walking twice a day for a couple of miles each time and also loves long hikes (although nervous of people he's getting better). He's great on the leash and walks really well without the need for correction and is not leash aggressive.\nVinny loves to be with you in the day and would suit a house with at least somebody around most of the day and a backyard to play in. He curls up in the day after his walk and snoozes and settles well at night. He is mostly house trained (requires going out every two hours in the day) with the occasional accident if he gets stressed or over-excited but he will overcome this. He is crate trained and happy to go in it in the day if necessary and sleeps well at night. He requires lots of attention guidance and kisses and will be your shadow where I go he goes he's super sweet and will be a fabulous companion.\nHe currently walks 40 mins twice a day and up to 8-mile hikes at the weekend. He has energy and needs a very active guardian with experience. Need a home with an attached back yard. Kids 12 yrs+.",

Sadly, their owner passed away on Christmas Day due to complications from COVID 19. The person who was boarding them is unable to keep them herself and asked the vet for assistance in finding them a new home and the vet suggested Lu\u2019s Labs - we were happy to step in and help. Jazz is a 2 year old, 52 pound black female and Sam is a 4 year old, 69 pounds chocolate male. Stay tuned for updates on this pair as we get to know them! \nDisclaimer: Please know this is a recently rescued dog that is still transitioning into a new home environment. Training, and even personality and energy levels are constantly evolving as the dog starts to feel better emotionally and physically. Your new dog will take days or even weeks to fully settle into his or her true self. What you read in this bio is a snapshot of this dog\u2019s evolving personality. Additionally, the age listed is an estimate provided by the shelter and/or veterinarian. Different vets can provide different age estimates. So always consider the lab you are adopting to be within an age range of a couple of years of what is listed. Also remember, while we are a lab rescue, we do not have papers on these dogs, we cannot confirm any breed specific claims, and many of these dogs may be mixed with other breeds.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ONE OF OUR DOGS... please visit us at www.luslabs.org and fill out an adoption application.  Once submitted, one of our Adoption Coordinators will be in touch!",

            "description": "Baxter and Jackson prove the concept that opposites definitely attract. These two fellows are bonded to each other and are absolute BFFs. Baxter is a gorgeous blond caramel color, while Jackson has shiny onyx black fur. Both are very sweet and beautiful boys that can\u2019t wait to meet their forever family.\n\nBaxter is one years old and weighs about 60 pounds. He is excellent with all dogs and likes to play with his foster brothers \u2014 especially his bestie Jackson. Baxter is medium energy. He also likes to play with toys. While Baxter is submissive and slower to warm up to people, he comes around once he knows you. In fact, Baxter\u2019s foster mom writes that she loves how \u201cBaxter is so loyal and once you gain his trust he is always by your side.\u201d He pulls a little on his leash but loves to be outside in the fresh air. He also is a great car passenger. Baxter is good in his crate and must be crated if unsupervised. He needs a refresher on most commands but as his confidence and trust grows, he\u2019ll be a wonderful student.\n\nJackson is 4 years old and weighs about 54 pounds. A medium energy pup, Jackson is the life of the party and is super friendly. No dog or person is a stranger to this outgoing pup. He plays well with all his doggo friends. He loves toys\u2014especially kongs. He self crates and stays there when his people aren\u2019t home. He is very smart and already knows sit, down and stay. He is eager to please and will be an avid student to learn how to keep all four on the floor, as well being less vocal. He is good with children and even sleeps in bed with his FM\u2019s daughter. He is a good on the leash and is also an excellent passenger for car rides. His FM says that this dream dog is one of the easiest fosters she\u2019s ever had.\n\nJackson is the ying to Baxter\u2019s yang, and they bring out the best in each other. Both pups are super sweet, and adore each other. They have not been observed around cats so can\u2019t go to a cat home, but they are approved for Guinea pigs! This beautiful pair would be a perfect twosome for a fun loving forever family.\n\nDisclaimer: Please know this is a recently rescued dog that is still transitioning into a new home environment. Training, and even personality and energy levels are constantly evolving as the dog starts to feel better emotionally and physically. Your new dog will take days or even weeks to fully settle into his or her true self. What you read in this bio is a snapshot of this dog\u2019s evolving personality. Additionally, the age listed is an estimate provided by the shelter and/or veterinarian. Different vets can provide different age estimates. So always consider the lab you are adopting to be within an age range of a couple of years of what is listed. Also remember, while we are a lab rescue, we do not have papers on these dogs, we cannot confirm any breed specific claims, and many of these dogs may be mixed with other breeds.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ONE OF OUR DOGS... please visit us at www.luslabs.org and fill out an adoption application.  Once submitted, one of our Adoption Coordinators will be in touch!",

            "description": "Meet Monty, our sweet southern gentleman! Monty is about 7 years old, weighs 50 pounds and has a shiny black coat. He was found as a stray in Louisiana and once we saw a picture of his sweet eyes, we knew he needed to be a Lu\u2019s Lab!\n\nMonty is a low energy pup who enjoys easy going walks through quiet neighborhoods. He isn\u2019t a fan of walking on busy streets, so he is required to go to a home with a 6ft+ fence. Monty loves other dogs and is approved for cats. He also loves to play fetch and will always bring the ball back! He has just started to play with toys and has grown especially fond of his toy named \u201cMr. Duckworth\u201d. His foster dad says that Mr. Duckworth will even move with Monty to his new forever home!\n\nMonty is approved for kids 10+.\n\nDisclaimer: Please know this is a recently rescued dog that is still transitioning into a new home environment. Training, and even personality and energy levels are constantly evolving as the dog starts to feel better emotionally and physically. Your new dog will take days or even weeks to fully settle into his or her true self. What you read in this bio is a snapshot of this dog\u2019s evolving personality. Additionally, the age listed is an estimate provided by the shelter and/or veterinarian. Different vets can provide different age estimates. So always consider the lab you are adopting to be within an age range of a couple of years of what is listed. Also remember, while we are a lab rescue, we do not have papers on these dogs, we cannot confirm any breed specific claims, and many of these dogs may be mixed with other breeds.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ONE OF OUR DOGS... please visit us at www.luslabs.org and fill out an adoption application.  Once submitted, one of our Adoption Coordinators will be in touch!",

            "description": "Meet JJ! This unique boy with the big brown eyes, radar ears and bushy tail was rescued from a hoarding situation, living in a dilapidated, trash-filled outdoor pen. Worthy Dog has rescued three other dogs from the property who needed medical care and rehabilitation. JJ was heartworm positive on intake, under-socialized and underweight, and going without consistent food, water, or any exposure to the outside world. He was initially very skittish and needed time to decompress, but his local foster parents have done a great job working with him and exposing him to new things, and helping him learn to trust. He's now been treated for heartworm and is ready to start his new life.\n\nJJ is living in the Park View area of DC with two other dogs in his foster home. He connects very quickly to the other dogs and finds comfort in pup companionship. We feel another dog in the home is a requirement for JJ to be at his best. He would also do better in a quieter area. He's still fearful of many sights and sounds in the city.\n\nHis foster mom, Cynthia, checked in with these updates:\n\nEnergy Level: JJ is a moderate energy dog. He is calm inside the home and content to snuggle with you on the couch, but does need and enjoy his daily walks and exercise. He gets excited when we get his leash for walks, and will now allow us to put his harness on without scampering away.\n\nLeash Walking Skills: JJ gets excited for his walks, although he's still nervous around busy intersections. He's happiest when there aren't many vehicles on the road. He ignores other dogs on his walks and is not reactive, but still needs some practice on his leash skills.\n\nPersonality: He's such a sweetheart and loves attention! He's not overly needy, but will definitely paw at your hand when he feels he deserves some affection. JJ is a great companion and allows us to pick him up and cuddle him when his humans need attention too! He's the type of pup that will seek you out when need be, but also likes to be with his canine buddies.\n\nHouse Manners (crate/potty training): He's crate trained, although he's still working on getting in willingly. Potty training has vastly improved--he gets the concept of going outside, but you have to remain consistent as he may have accidents if he's not on a strict schedule. He's great with our other dogs and loves to cuddle with them!\n\nJJ is a very loving, affectionate pup who LOVES other dogs. He was a little timid with his foster parents at first, but once he's warms up, he's very connected to his people. He needs a patient owner to settle him in and will do best in a calm home environment. We really feel he needs another dog in the home to help him better acclimate. Coming from a hoarding situation, his entire community was other dogs, and he finds comfort in them. JJ is still spooked by traffic/noises, so he's not the best city/condo dog.\n\nFOSTER UPDATE - 1/23/21 - \"It took a few weeks but JJ has really settled in. He plays now, and has a really cute personality. He's not as jumpy or skittish to sudden noises. He still follows our pups around and is very connected to other dogs. He would love a playmate in his new home. He's a great dog and it's going to be hard to see him go.\"\n\nRequirements:\n\nQuiet suburban setting\n\nNeeds another social, calm dog in the home\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Rat Terrier/Basenji mix\nGENDER: Male\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 21 - 22 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 3 to 4 years\nCOAT TYPE: Medium\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/neutered/microchipped/treated for heartworm\nLOCATION: Washington, DC\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

His ideal adopter would be someone who is experienced and can show him the ropes.\nSadly, Buddy has tested positive for heart-worms, due to this he will need an owner who can provide him with a calm environment while he goes through treatment and celebrates with him as he recovers! Buddy does best with larger kids who will understand when he needs time and space to heal. Buddy will need to be the only dog in the house and has not been tested with cats. He may be able to live with cats if his new owner is willing to go slow and steady with introductions and training.\nIf you have any questions or would like to meet Buddy, please call us at 530-343-7917 x 201, our dog adoptions staff will be happy to answer any questions you may have!",

Cowboy is now in our care and receiving all the love, attention, and groceries he can get! He is a happy go lucky fellow and gives anyone that takes him out his undivided attention. He loves peanut butter kongs and spending time with our staff and volunteers. When he gets the chance to run around in our field, we like to imagine he is running the barrel pattern as he cuts tight turns around his toys. Cowboy is truly a big 'ole puppy and is going to make the perfect loyal companion for whoever takes him home forever. He will be ready to go home after he is neutered, but you can go ahead and apply for his adoption today! \n\nIf you are interested in Cowboy, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org. \n",

I love children, and have been growing up with my own 2 year old human, however my mom and dad have decided that they can no longer be a family and my mom is having a hard time taking care of me the way I should be. I just had my own litter of puppies in November of 2020, and thankfully RUFF stepped in and helped us out and all of my babies have found their forever homes. Now it's my turn! I love kids, I am ok with other dogs, haven't been around that many cats, so not sure about them yet. I am house broken, and yes I have a crate, but I don't really spend much time in there - I prefer sleeping with my humans. I do ok on a leash, like when we get to go to the park, but I haven't spent a lot of time using one of those either, so I may need you to teach me to be a proper young lady when walking. I do love to run and play, so I hope you are ready for some fun, but if snuggling on the couch is your thing, hey I am up for that too. Everyone tells me I am such a loving and sweet girl. I just want to get the chance to show you just what a good girl I am! (CL/TP*)\n\nUp to date on age appropriate vaccines, spayed and micro-chipped.\n\nAdoption Fee: $200.00",

He its fully vetted, neutered, and ready for adoption. Due to his size and prey drive, we recommend Bug to be an only pet (no other dogs, cats, horses, livestock) and in a home with no small children. He will require a tall physical fence. He does have some quirks, but in the right home, he will thrive. He is a very loyal boy.\n\nTo apply, please visit: https://papitstop.org/adoptables\n\nBug is located in Shillington, PA",

I'm super soft and fluffy, just like a teddy bear. I also have a super cool blue tongue.I am neutered and just had shots in October to kill my heartworms.\n\nI need a slow introduction to other pets. I get along really well with my foster dog sister. I co-exist with my foster cat brother. I like to chase the cat, which the cat doesn't like.\n\nI just started learning how to play! I love to play with my foster dog sister 1 - 2 times a day. The rest of the day I sleep. I also love to shake toys and chew on bones. I never chew on human things. I get tired pretty quickly and stay calm throughout the day. I wait by the door when I need to go outside. I don't bark. I'm calm when visitors come over. I like to be pet and have my belly rubbed. I have a few skin tags/moles, but my fur is growing back thick and you can hardly notice them! They don't bother me one bit. I weigh about 50 lbs and am medium sized.\n\nI would love to come home with you for the holidays!\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

She had little to no socialization  with other dogs and people, other than to watch them take her puppies away.  But, that life is now behind her and she's looking forward to a new home.   Sophie's one of the shyest mill dogs we've helped.  Because of that, SHE REQUIRES A SECURE WELL-BUILT FENCE WITHOUT ANY CHANCE OF ESCAPE.  If she were to get out of the yard, it would be next to impossible to get her back.  None of us, especially Sophie, wants that.  She will also benefit from having another confident dog in the home.  Her new home will need to be within approximately 1 hour from the Akron/Cleveland area.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To adopt a Golden that you see here, please go to the Golden Treasures  Golden Retriever website at <a href=\"http://goldentreasuresrescue.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.goldentreasuresrescue.org</a>.

She is about 65 pounds of sweetness and energy. Her breed was listed as lab/great dane mix but since she is already two years old she won\u2019t be growing into great dane size ; 0 )\n\nShe walks nicely on a leash if there are no distractions but can be a puller, especially if other dogs or people are around. We are going to get some training support for Storm so she can easily be handled on leash for her new family.  She sits on command and is learning \u201cdown\u201d.\n\nAn active family is a must for Storm and we think she would bowl over young children. The shelter thought a dog of similar size and energy would be the best type of match but we are finding that she may want to be an only dog in her new home. Storm rides well in the car in a crate and is a happy sweet girl! Her vet checked her out thoroughly because her original paperwork indicated she had surgery last year to put a pin in her femur. We don\u2019t know what type of trouble she got herself into but she is healthy and not slowed down at all now!\n\nIf you have interest in meeting Storm or any of our cuties, please fill out the adoption application here: http://www.luckypuprescue.org/adoption-application.\n\nPlease note: we do not have a physical facility where our dogs are housed; they are cared for in our wonderful foster network throughout New England. It is our expectation that, once approved, a potential family will meet the dog(s) in the foster setting where they are feeling safe and loved.\n\nThank you for considering rescue!",

We have been working with a few rescues in Tijuana Mexico and saving dogs from the streets.  \n\nWe just got her so are still getting to know her personality.  She loves to sit in your lap, doesn\u2019t play with toys yet or other dogs.  She is good around other dogs, isn\u2019t a barker and seems to be house trained.  \n\nShe is spayed, updated on shots, dewormed, had a teeth cleaning and is microchipped.  If you are interested in Bitsy, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.",

I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control and am so happy to be part of the Mostly Mutts family as I look for my furever home!  \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I haven\u2019t officially met other dogs at Mostly Mutts yet, but I will be dog tested soon.  I seemed interested in them from afar while on my walks, so if you have a nice doggie at home already, let\u2019s meet with my trainer and see if we can be friends / I was quite agitated when I spotted a kitty through the window while in my short break foster home, so I should probably not live with cats / I am possessive of my toys and can be a bit dominant, so best there not be children in my new home.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am playful.  In fact, my foster described me as a \u2018play all day\u2019 kind of guy.  I am an athletic fellow who needs regular exercise, or I get bored and can get into mischief.  I can sometimes be head strong and want things my way, so I am looking for a dog savvy leader that will help me become a good follower.  I am affectionate, but when I\u2019m tired, it seems that I want that on my terms. I have snapped a couple of times but did not bite down \u2013 once over unwanted affection and a couple of times over resource guarding my toys / My energy level is 6-8 so let\u2019s be active together!\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am now a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, where I am learning lots of great doggie commands with my trainer, including working on my resource guarding behaviors.  I know the \u2018sit\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 commands, and take my training treats nicely.  Check back soon to see my progress / I wasn\u2019t crated in my short break foster home, as I resisted going in it.  My crate manners at Mostly Mutts have been good / I had a couple of accidents on the first days in my short break foster home, but I have done well on a good schedule.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like toys, though I tend to destroy soft ones, so be sure they are sturdy for strong chewers.  I love to play with Kongs or anything else I can fetch.  When not playing, I enjoy receiving affection on my terms / I don\u2019t like to share my stuff, and I will be working on this with my training, so I can be a great companion to my people.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered.\n\nI am looking for a great family dedicated to my training and to giving me the loving home all dogs deserve!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

He is very well behaved in the car and has a very loving attitude. I took him for a walk and overall he was pretty well-behaved; but he does needs a bit of training / more experience being around people/animals. A little bit of training and discipline - he would be the perfect walking/jogging buddy! He does have a lot of puppy energy , so his ideal owner would be someone who has the time to take him out for some daily exercise! Overall, i had a great day with Turner & him falling asleep on my lap in the car was the sweetest thing. Whoever chooses to adopt this boy will have a such a loving friend for life\n\nTurner knows the commands sit and paw he is a verry bright boy with lost of love to give. Turner was found as a stray and taken to a local shelter. The county shelter asked us to take Turner and from the moment he walked into our rescue, he has been very friendly to all of us:) Very active needs to be leash trained, best in an active family to run, jog and be a strong loving person, He is not good with cats, plays rough do to his energy.",

            "description": "Courtesy Post (Washington, DC) Meet adorable Duncan!\nIf you are looking for a handsome, smart, loving, active family pup, Duncan is the boy for you!\n\nDuncan\n\nAKA Dunk\nis a loving 45-pound ball of energy, with the brains to keep up! He's a 1.5-year-old pit bull terrier mix and lives in a small apartment in the city, but at his age, he's too active for city life and is looking for a new home in the quieter suburbs where he can do some of his favorite things, which include running, tugging on his tough toys, and learning new things.\n\nDuncan\n\nloves\nthe great outdoors and would thrive in a home with an active family where he will get 3+ walks a day or would be able to go on daily hikes unless it's raining, in which case, he prefers quick potty breaks then back into the dry house. Due to his high energy, a fenced yard and neighborhood walks, or hikes would be ideal so can run around and get his zoomies out. Dog parks are not a good fit for him.\n\nDuncan is house-broken and has learned basic commands of sit, down, stand, and wait and has started on settle training with a mat too!\n\nHe has his basic manner-commands down and is very treat motivated and willing to learn which makes him an excellent candidate for some basic training.\n\nHe loves ALL food and is willing to bend over backwards (or at least roll-over) to earn a treat. After a long hard day on the couch,\nDuncan\nenjoys play time and long walks around the neighborhood. By the end of the evening, all he wants is to curl up on your lap or snuggle by your side. He will make his way into your heart very quickly.\n\nDuncan\n\nwould LOVE to be in a home with someone interested in working on basic reactivity training as he can get overly excited by his surroundings. He is a smart pup and learns quickly. He will be excited to learn new tricks or work for food puzzles. Being a young pup, h\ne\n\ncan\nget over-excited\nso he needs a family who will be patient with him and will help work on relaxation and work to get his energy out. He does well in his crate, and he retreats to it as his safe, relaxing space when he needs some quiet time.\n\nDuncan's energy level and tendency towards rough play make him the ideal candidate for a house or townhouse with a yard, without cats or young kids (kids ages 10+) and he should\n\nlikely be the only pet in the home.\n\nHe has gotten along with calmer dogs after a slow introduction.\n\nHe would do great\nin\na suburban neighborhood environment where he can sniff on his walks and not worry about too many distractions like the ones he faces in t\nh\ne city.\n\nIf you would like to make Duncan a part of your family, please fill out an adoption application at www.lovepawspg.org. Duncan is UTD on all his shots, is heartworm negative and neutered. His adoption fee is $300. LOVEPAWS will be facilitating his adoption between his owner and the adopter.",

            "description": "Bailey - in Maine - updated January 2021\n\nBailey just had a birthday! She is a 1 yr. old 50 lb boxer mix who needs a savvy individual or family to help her through the next phase of learning. She is a lovable and snuggly girl when she is tired out but she is a busy one! Bailey has not had a lot of limits put on her in her past so she has learned to push them. She is very responsive to training and has been working with our friends at Kompletely K9 Dog Training and Rehabilitation to help her become the awesome girl she can be! She responds to clear expectations.\n\nBailey is not a crate lover but needs it to keep her safe from chewing, counter-surfing and general mischief. She uses an indestructible crate right now which will be an investment for a new family. Bailey is learning \u201cplace\u201d and is learning she doesn\u2019t need to guard resources, especially not the humans in her life. She seems to like most dogs but she wants to be the boss of them if she doesn\u2019t have limits set for her.\n\nBailey likes young people but with her tendency to boss around and guard, we think that older kids would be the best for her so that she doesn\u2019t treat little ones as packmates.\n\nA new owner will need to be experienced with dog ownership and be willing to follow up with training for Bailey.\n\nIf you have interest in meeting Bailey or any of our cuties, please fill out the adoption application here: http://www.luckypuprescue.org/adoption-application.\n\nPlease note: we do not have a physical facility where our dogs are housed; they are cared for in our wonderful foster network throughout New England. It is our expectation that, once approved, a potential family will meet the dog(s) in the foster setting where they are feeling safe and loved.\n\nThank you for considering rescue!",

            "description": "Grace arrived at the shelter on 1-10-21 and is now available for adoption. Grace is a Border Collie mix who is around 5-6 years old. We think Grace was brought into town and dumped because of the way she was acting when she was picked up by ACO. Her first day was tail tucked and head down and she just didn't know what was happening to her. With a lot of love and reassures from the staff Grace has came out of her shell. This girl is so low key and the sweetest thing you will meet. She loves her treats and lots of love. She is greet in her kennel and she likes to go outside and patrol the yard to make sure we are safe. Grace will be spayed and given a rabies vaccination before going to her new home.  \n\nApproved adoption applications will be contacted for an appointment.\n\nIf you are interested in putting in an application on this animal, please copy and paste the link below to fill out our application for adoption. https://siloamsprings.seamlessdocs.com/f/JRJtFk\n\nWe have a wonderful foster program available (if you live inside city limits) to see if the animal compliments or complicates your life. This is an excellent way to see how the pet would get along with family members and other pets! The paperwork takes just a few minutes and you can walk out the door worry free with a fuzzy friend. Call today to inquire more about how you can take this pet home! If you are adopting this cutie, contact the shelter for adoption fees. The Shelter hours are Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri, 11-5 and Saturday 10-3 closed on Sun and Wed. Our number is 479-524-6535. All animals will be spayed/neuter before going to their new home",

            "description": "Buster - in Maine - updated January 2021\n\nBuster is a 14-15 year old tan Pekingese who recently lost his human mom. This senior sweetie can be a bit anxious but he is managing well in his foster home. He has one eye and has developed some incontinence in his senior years so he uses a belly band when in the house to catch any dribbles. He LOVES to walk and goes for 3 short jaunts a day; he doesn\u2019t run marathons at his age with arthritis in his little hips but he does love to explore. He is such a loving and fun little sweetheart; we\u2019d love to see him have a retirement home where he could be doted on. He uses eye drops to help the remaining eye stay healthy and a medication to help him feel less anxious. He is groomed every 3 months to keep him in tip-top shape, you can tell he has been so loved! It is important that Buster have someone home the majority of the time. Besides walks, he loves to have his cheeks rubbed, to be snuggled and carried, and to eat cooked chicken! His zest for life is obvious when you meet him.\n\nBuster loves people of all ages; he has not been around cats that we know of. When he meets a new dog he barks at them for a while then makes friends. Change can be hard for this little old man so we want to be sure that an individual or family is ready to transition him slowly into a new life.\n\nIf you have interest in meeting Buster or any of our cuties, please fill out the adoption application here: http://www.luckypuprescue.org/adoption-application.\n\nPlease note: we do not have a physical facility where our dogs are housed; they are cared for in our wonderful foster network throughout New England. It is our expectation that, once approved, a potential family will meet the dog(s) in the foster setting where they are feeling safe and loved.\n\nThank you for considering rescue!",

            "description": "Hi, I am King. I am a super good looking 8 month old black/rust male Doberman with natural ears and a docked tail.  I currently weigh about 60 lbs, but I am still growing.  \nSince I am so young, DAR&E requires that I have a fenced yard. No invisible fences. I am very sweet and LOVE to cuddle and snuggle with my people. If you are looking for a velcro buddy I am your guy!  I love people and know not to jump on people when they visit. \nI am still a puppy but I try to be a good puppy!  I am hoping for a family that will help me continue to learn how grown-up dobes are expected to act.  I learn fast and really want to make my new family proud of me!  \nI am already house-trained and I love my crate when it\u2019s bedtime. I even know how to ring a bell to let you know I need to go out! My foster mom is teaching me some basic obedience, but I will need someone who has the time and patience to continue my training. \nI love playing with my foster mom's 3 dogs so a home with a dog or 2 that likes to play would be so much fun! I have lots of puppy energy to burn. I think cats are so much fun to chase, but my foster mom said no cats for me. I guess the cats don't think it\u2019s as much fun as I do. Well, there you go. That\u2019s me in a nutshell, as they say!  If you are up for a young, exciting pup like me, email my foster mom to arrange to meet me. \n\nDAR&E places dogs in MD, DC, VA and parts of WVA only.  \nIf you are interested in this pet please follow the link below to read about our adoption process and submit an adoption application.

I currently weigh about 60 lbs, but I am still growing.  \nSince I am so young, DAR&E requires that I have a fenced yard. No invisible fences. I am very sweet and LOVE to cuddle and snuggle with my people. If you are looking for a velcro buddy I am your guy!  I love people and know not to jump on people when they visit. \nI am still a puppy but I try to be a good puppy!  I am hoping for a family that will help me continue to learn how grown-up dobes are expected to act.  I learn fast and really want to make my new family proud of me!  \nI am already house-trained and I love my crate when it\u2019s bedtime. I even know how to ring a bell to let you know I need to go out! My foster mom is teaching me some basic obedience, but I will need someone who has the time and patience to continue my training. \nI love playing with my foster mom's 3 dogs so a home with a dog or 2 that likes to play would be so much fun! I have lots of puppy energy to burn. I think cats are so much fun to chase, but my foster mom said no cats for me. I guess the cats don't think it\u2019s as much fun as I do. Well, there you go. That\u2019s me in a nutshell, as they say!  If you are up for a young, exciting pup like me, email my foster mom to arrange to meet me. \n\nDAR&E places dogs in MD, DC, VA and parts of WVA only.  \nIf you are interested in this pet please follow the link below to read about our adoption process and submit an adoption application.

I'm Puddin' and I'm a lover: Adults, children, dogs, cats I love everyone!\nBesides being adorable and a social butterfly, I am a playful, happy puppy. I love to snuggle,\nget hugs, go for walks, play tug, chew on stick chews, nylabones and deer antlers, filled kongs\nare yummy during crate time, and really, I like all toys. Oh and my BFF, Frankie! I love going to\nFrankie's house for play time!\nI am kennel trained, sleep there at night and have never had an accident in the crate.\nSometimes, my foster mom is in a meeting and can't take me out when I need to go, so I use\nthe puppy pad she puts down for me.\nI hope you love me so far and can overlook my one imperfection. You see, something\nhappened to my foot when I was very young and I didn't get medical attention. All the bones in\nmy left foot were broken and didn't heal properly. That's why I stand like a ballerina. The nice\npeople at Needy Paws took me to a surgeon who thought he could fix me, but he couldn't. It\ndoesn't slow me down. I can still run and play and do all the other puppy things, but I will need\nto be on joint supplements for the rest of my life.\nSo if you like taking walks and will take the time to train me, I will be your lifelong, loving\ncompanion.\nLove,\nPuddin'\n\nIf interested, please\ncomplete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "Hi there!  Have you been looking for a bonded pair of cuties?  If so, Stella and Cole are waiting for you! They initially came into rescue after being found abandoned on a country road at about 7 months old.  Both were adopted individually but, sadly, did not adjust well in their homes so they were returned to their foster dad where they were (and are again) happy.  He has concluded that they need a home where they can remain together.\n\nThese cuties are Chihuahua / Beagle mix pups.  They\u2019re 1 year old and both weigh in at about 20 pounds.\nStella (red collar) shows more of the beagle side.  Cole (blue collar) is more of a mixture.  Both are playful and friendly with people and fine with kids.  They can be high strung at times so we think older kids would be the best fit.   \n\nThey get along well with the other dogs in their foster home and enjoy playing with them \u2013 even the big ones. They do get bossy when food is around so we believe the ideal situation for them will be as the only pets in their forever home.  A fenced yard will be perfect because these energizer bunnies love to be outdoors and run around.  Just leash walking a couple times daily is probably not enough to keep them adequately exercised.  Both Stella and Cole are crate trained and leash trained.  They are basically house trained, though they still need some watching.  Stella sometimes has a submissive \u201ctinkle\u201d and Cole occasionally marks inside, but with a regular routine and positive reinforcement, they\u2019ll do fine.\n\nBoth Stella and Cole have been spayed and neutered.  They are also up to date on vaccines and microchipped.  Their doggy bags are packed and they can\u2019t wait to learn that their forever home has been found.  If you\u2019d like to double your pleasure and fun with these two cuties, please email   Alyson at alysonbrunelli@gmail.com (include phone number) for an application and she\u2019ll get one right out to you.  The adoption fee for the pair is $450.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pawsclawsnewengland\n",

            "description": "Foxy is a sweet gal that starts off as a little timid but then shows her great personality once she is out of the shelter setting. She did pull hard on the leash initially but probably because she was anxious to get outside and explore. Once she got that out of her system, she quit pulling as much and was calm. She already sits on command for treats and shows affection. She came to me several time and put her head in my lap and wanted some petting. Foxy is a beautiful red sable with a long full tail and regal look. She got good grades in every category of her behavioral assessment too! \n\nPhotographs & observations by volunteer S Shaffer 12/3/20",

I love to play and run, and would do best in an active household that has experience with dogs, as I can be quite a handful and have some behaviours that i need someone to help me work through. This just gives us more opportunity to learn together and bond! A couple quirky habits aside, I am a total lovebug. I looove people, and other dogs (provided they like me, I can be a bit much for some). It is impossible to meet me and not fall in love. Up for all I have to offer? Apply for me!",

I was found as a stray a few years back and some cool folks loaded me up in their car and brought me to ARFhouse! When I arrived I had heartworms but the girls had me treated and now I'm happy, healthy and ready for my forever home! \n\nI am a spunky boy; I love to run and play! I do well on a leash but could use some 'fine-tuning'. I am a happy, friendly boy, but I look to my humans for confidence in new surroundings. I am eager to please and I love to snuggle and give all the kisses! I am a big, frisky boy and would not be suited for an apartment. I will need a large, fenced yard so that I can run and play anytime I want! I would love to go on long walks or runs with my humans, play ball in the yard and snuggle up on the couch to watch a movie at the end of a long day. \n\nThe fee to adopt Eastwood is $200.00; this includes: neuter, vaccines, deworming and a microchip. \n\n**Please Note: Eastwood is currently located at our facility in Sherman, TX. Adoptions are BY-APPOINTMENT ONLY. If you are interested in adopting Eastwood, please visit our website, www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you to discuss any questions she may have, or to schedule a time for you to meet Eastwood.",

She bears some evidence of not having the best life until now.  She loves people and she's a happy girl, but very sensitive about having her head, mouth and tail touched, so she should not go to a home with children.   Chrissy will do best in a home with people who are willing to identify and respect her signals and boundaries.\n\nPlease note:\n\nAt this time, our dog kennels are open for general visitation without a prior appointment. We will, however, be limiting the number of persons in the kennel area at one time, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nVisits with cats and/or critters still require that an appointment be made in advance. To schedule your appointment, please call us at (703) 792-6465, or email us at animalshelter@pwcgov.org.\n\nAll persons will be required to wear a face mask when visiting the PWC Animal Shelter. This requirement complies with Governor Ralph Northam's Executive Order No.63 (https://bit.ly/2AnqGXd).",

We will, however, be limiting the number of persons in the kennel area at one time, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nVisits with cats and/or critters still require that an appointment be made in advance. To schedule your appointment, please call us at (703) 792-6465, or email us at animalshelter@pwcgov.org.\n\nAll persons will be required to wear a face mask when visiting the PWC Animal Shelter.

            "description": "Penny was recently let go for not being interested in the hunting life. Her passion you wonder? Looking for food and squirrels. She'd love a job doing just that. Penny also doesn't mind other dogs, is house broke, and is crate trained.\n\nPenny is a Coonhound, 4 years old and is ready to go home! Penny's adoption fee is $150.00 and includes her spay, microchip, 30-days pet health insurance, vaccinations, worming and a vet visit voucher. Some of our dogs have also had heartworm tests, flea treatments, canine influenza vaccines, etc., but it is not standard procedure - please inquire about the specific animal you are interested in.\n\nWe do adopt out-of-state, but require adopters to meet the pet prior to taking it home. The adopters also must have a plan for getting their new addition home before we process an application. Please check out the airlines, PilotsNPaws, Operation Roger and CARE Transport in Denver for some transport options.\n\nWe are open Monday - Friday 11:00 am to 5 pm. You can also call us at 719-680-2385. To fill out the adoption application online please visit our website at noahsarktrinidad.org where you can then email the application with your inquiry.\n\nThank you for considering adoption through our shelter.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Name: Mikasa\nAge: DOB Approx. 10/07/18\nGender: Female\nBreed: Pitty\nWeight: 52\nDog friendly: Yes\nCat friendly: TBD\nKid friendly: Yes\nHouse Trained: Yes\nCrate Trained: Working on it\nEnergy level: Moderate\nHistory: pulled from an animal control\nAdoption Fee: $500\n\nFrom the Foster:\n\nIf your life could use a little extra sunshine and happiness, please take a moment to read about this ray of sunshine known as Mikasa. You can't help but smile when you're around her, thanks to her sweet demeanor, constantly wagging tail, and the abundance of kisses she tries to shower you with. She is such a friendly dog, to both people and other dogs. If she had her way, she would be next to you or on you at all times. She is that much of a lover, and really wants to be with her person as much as possible. To put it simply, Mikasa just wants to love and be loved in return.\n\nMikasa's absolute favorite thing to do is play with my resident dog, which she has yet to tire of. She plays hard and as often as possible, so it's important that any dog(s) in her future home would be a good match for her play style and energy needs. Even though I know she would LOVE to have a dog sibling in her furever home, I think she would be okay as an only dog if given plenty of socialization opportunities with other dogs. She is a very active girl and needs a lot of physical and mental stimulation throughout the day. She is not the type of dog who wants to hang out and sleep the day away. She is going to live her life to the fullest and wants to take advantage of every second of every day. Mikasa loves to spend time outdoors and actually jumps in the air when I ask if she wants to go outside. Having a yard she can romp around in would be a huge plus for her.\n\nNow for the fun stuff! Mikasa is potty-trained and does very well doing her business on walks and in my yard, though she does prefer to get things done in the yard. We are working on leash training since she is a strong pup who loves to pull on walks, especially if she sees a squirrel or rabbit. She has made excellent progress on her crate training and has now decided that her crate is a comfy and safe space. She sleeps soundly in her crate every night and is crated when I have to leave the house. Mikasa doesn't want to miss out on anything, so if she knows you're off doing something without her, she can be very vocal. Because of this, I don't think shared walls would be the best living situation for her. With patience, love, positive training, and some really tasty treats, I know Mikasa will truly thrive in the right home.\n\nMikasa is pending some medical care but still available for adoption. She has bilateral (both sides) grade 2/4 luxating patellas on her rear knees and will need 2 orthopedic surgeries completed by a specialist at the SHH Vet Center.\n\nThe recovery period requires strict rest and restricted activity for 12 weeks *per surgery* so any adopter just needs to be aware of this care and treatment. The estimated amount of time with surgery and recovery is 6+ months for both procedures.\n\nMiksasa will be adopted with an FTA (foster to adopt) contract so the adoption can take place, while SHH still manages the financial responsibility of my orthopedic surgery. Any other medical care needed outside of these surgeries\ncovered by the FTA contract\nwould be the responsibility of the adopter.",

She loves to sit 'right' next to you and will inch closer and closer. She is a lap dog and loves being carried. She loves her people so much; she will bark at strangers until she warms up. Mini is housetrained and waits by the door to go out. She is fostered with other small dogs and tolerates them. She does get possessive (growling) about food around other dogs (never people), but the dogs she is fostered with are not threatened by her tiny size and usually just ignore her. She likes cats. Her real passion is 'her' people. She enjoys sleeping in, cuddled up under the blankets with someone she adores. She is fostered with several children and prefers kids over 10. She also likes adults. She enjoys to be petted by younger children, but will growl if they try to pick her up or move her. She has not nipped at anyone in her foster house (other than the male dog she is fostered with). She is vocal and will ask for attention, love, and snacks. If you ask her a question, she will likely speak back to you. Her bark is rather gruff for her size (not too shrill). She likes to play. She enjoys going for a walk on a leash. Though she is rarely crated in her foster home, she will bark until you leave or if you are in sight. She will settle down quickly in her crate if you leave her a warm and comfy bed.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Oz is ready for adoption! He is a beautiful brindle and whit French Bulldog. Oz is about 6 - 7 years old and weighs 25 pounds. He does have medical needs so please read his profile carefully.\n\nOz came to us a few months ago with some major medical needs. He had severe ear infections, a cauliflower ear, underweight and a major tumor on his front leg. Fattening him up was easy! We took care of his ears but please understand that he will likely have issues in the future. He will need to have his ears cleaned regularly and remain on a quality grain free diet as that has helped. As for the mass, we had it removed and let him heal. The mass was cancerous and will likely return. But it is not a type of cancer that will spread internally. So any lump or bump he gets needs to be looked at right away and biopsied.\n\nNow on to the good stuff! Oz is a charming little toad! He is definitely a foster favorite! He loves people! He loves to get attention and will be your best friend for some ear rubs. Oz is crate trained but his foster mom hardly puts him in it any more. Oz is leash trained. He gets so excited when he sees the leash! He is very good in the car too. Oz is nicely housetrained but you do have to do some convincing to get him up in the morning. Lazy bulldog! Please expect some adjustment time though as he learns a new home and routine. He does have a fully fenced yard in his foster home, which he loves in nice weather. Oz is good with other dogs but like a typical bulldog, will give an occasional \"get out of my space\" jab, usually towards puppies. Oz has no issues with cats, in fact they like to clean his face for him! Oz gets his face washed by his foster mom to help keep his wrinkles and creases clean. He loves that. Oz comes when he is called and sits nicely for a treat. Cheese is a favorite for this Frenchie. Oz makes lots of noises - he snores like a champ! Bulldog experience is preferred but not required.\n\nA lot of people think they want a bulldog but do not realize that they are an expensive, quirky dogs! Between food and vet care, please expect to spend more then you ever had on a dog. Oz has many years left to him but only if he will be well taken care of. We will not compromise on the home we are looking for him.\n\nOz is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, and tested neg. for heartworm. His adoption fee is $350",

This gentle giant was left at a boarding facility by his family where he lived for 2 years before we rescued him. We think he is about 7 years old and does take one pill daily to help him with his mobility. He enjoys short leisurely walks, endless cuddling, is a great co-pilot in the car, can be a bit of a Cookie Monster and loves lounging in the sun. He did get to briefly live in a home but unfortunately he was returned to us so we think it would be best if he was the only dog in the home. He is incredibly kind, loving and gentle so we are looking for a quiet home with the same qualities where he can live his best life. \nBecause we require home checks adoptions are limited to the Los Angeles, Ca area.",

Probably because I love to say Hi to everyone, whether they walk on two legs or four. I get lots of comments wherever I go because people love my short stubby legs and my spotted face. I've shared living space with lots of doggie roommates and do well as long as they don't get too bossy. I'm not a big fan of being told what to do. I also like children but they get me over-stimulated with loud noises and fast movements, so I'd prefer a house with older kids that know how to respect a dog's boundaries. \n\nI absolutely love to run and play in water. I hope my new family has a lake, or a river, or a plastic swimming pool, or even a water hose? Surprisingly though, I'm afraid to walk through puddles on the sidewalk or go out in the rain. \n\nMy second favorite hobby is to ride shotgun in the car. I'm always excited to go to new places and I've been working really hard on my self control to remain calm, so I hope you can help me continue to learn. I've gotten pretty good, but I still lose my head whenever a loud motorcycle drives by! \n\nI love to eat! I spend most of my days thinking about food but I've lost 6lbs through hard work and dedication. I'm now at a very sexy 66lbs. I'll walk very calmly by your side without pulling on the leash and I really enjoy working out with the occasional sprint (but not very far because my legs are so short). After a good exercise, I'll sprawl out on the floor and enjoy a good belly rub or rump scratch.\n\nAre you ready to help me keep my New Year Resolution to stay in shape?",

Playing ball and cuddling, of course. She also happens to be a best-of-both-worlds kind of gal - she still has a spring in her step and she doesn't mind vegging out with you on the couch. As with many mature dogs, we are recommending that Prudence be on long-term daily joint supplements, as she does have some mild hip dysplasia, however with the right amount of exercise, weight management and the supplements, she is feeling and looking great! Prudence is also hoping to land herself in a home where she can be your one and only pup, and wouldn't mind some older, teen-aged kids to keep her entertained. \n\nThink this sweet girl could be the one? Consider filling out an adoption application and give us a call today to set up an appointment to meet Miss Prudence. She just can't wait to meet you!",

Upon arrival she refused to come out of the animal control truck and our trainer had to spend some time gaining tiny bits of trust in order to carry her down to her kennel without causing Leah to panic. It took days for our trainer to gain enough trust to even give Leah a tiny scratch on her ear. Leah has been through our Slow Track Training Program and is now walking with volunteers on a leash, playing with groups of dogs, and bravely meeting new people. Leah finds so much joy in actually running and playing, little things that were denied to her until now. \n\nLeah is a very special girl needing a special home. She loves the companionship of other dogs and gets along well with cats. She is still timid and cannot go to a home with children under the age of 10. She will also need a home with a securely fenced in yard. Once she knows you, she loves attention and cuddling. We would love for Leah's potential adopters to come spend some time with her during 1-2 meetings before taking her home. \n\nIf you are interested in Leah, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org.\n",

He was brought to animal services to be euthanized because the owners didn\u2019t want him and we couldn\u2019t let that happen.  In addition to his age, he is partially blind.  He does get nippy, especially if he\u2019s startled. He needs someone who will take the time to let him trust as he\u2019s been through so much and he deserves to have a home for the remainder of his days.  We are looking for that special home for him.  His adoption donation is $100 or we are looking for a foster.  He will be eternally grateful to have a loving home so please give him a chance.  Thank you.\nhttp://www.aforeverhomeanimalrescue.org/Project/sparky-5/\nWe are only able to adopt within the state of Florida.  \nWe have a page on our website that explains our adoption process, and contains a link to our adoption application.
